üìÑ Documentation Report: Pediatric Pulmonology Medical Chatbot

1. ‚úÖ OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Title: A Pediatric Pulmonology Medical Chatbot

Objective:
To develop a conversational AI assistant that provides informative, medically relevant responses related to pediatric pulmonary conditions such as asthma, bronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia, based on structured and curated medical data.

2. üìÇ DATA COLLECTION

Data Source:
The chatbot was trained on a set of plain-text .txt files containing:
1. Disease definitions
2. Symptoms
3. Red flags
4. Treatment guidelines
5. General advice

These files were manually curated and sourced from:
1. Pediatric pulmonology textbooks
2. Publicly available medical guidelines (e.g., CDC, WHO)
3. Verified medical websites and publications

DATA PREPROCESSING:
1. Merged the two .txt files into a one structured dataset knowledge base.
2. Cleaned for consistency: removed line breaks, standardized medical terms.

Categorized into:
1. definition
2. symptoms
3. red_flags
4. advice

These are some of the categories that the dataset was divided into.

3. üß† MODEL ARCHITECTURE

Models Used:
1. spaCy TextCategorizer (for intent detection)
2. Rule-based Classifier (fallback)

No deep learning or large language models were trained from scratch.

Simple logic maps user queries to conditions using classification and keyword-based rules.

spaCy Pipeline:
Pretrained en_core_web_trf transformer model (based on RoBERTa)

Custom categories for:
1. Asthma
2. Bronchiolitis
3. Pneumonia
4. Cystic Fibrosis
5. Others

INTENT PREDICTION:
Input text ‚Üí spaCy ‚Üí TextCategorizer ‚Üí Predicted condition with confidence score

4. üåê INTEGRATION OF GRADIO IN THE CHATBOT

Why Gradio?:
1. Easy interface for non-developers
2. Instant deployment in notebooks
3. Native support for markdown & chat history

These are some of the reasons I chose to use gradio for the interface of the chatbot.

5. ü§ó DEPLOYMENT ON HUGGING FACE SPACES

Why Hugging Face Spaces?:
1. Free hosting for AI demos
2. Public access via web
3. Integration with GitHub

The chatbot is now live at:

6. üõ°Ô∏è LIMITATIONS AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Not a Medical Device:
1. This chatbot does not provide diagnoses.
2. It‚Äôs intended for informational and educational purposes only.
3. Should not be used as a replacement for a licensed pediatric pulmonologist.

Limitations:
1. Only recognizes predefined conditions.
2. No real-time symptom analysis.
3. Does not support multi-turn complex reasoning.

These are some of the limitations and ethical considerations of the medical chatbot.

7. üìà FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS I PLAN ON MAKING TO THE CHATBOT:

These are some of the improvements I plan on making to the chatbot.
1. Integration with OpenAI GPT or a fine-tuned LLM for better generalization.
2. Voice interface for accessibility.
3. Rich UI with links to trusted sources (e.g., AAP, Mayo Clinic).
4. Expand to other pediatric specialties (e.g., cardiology, neurology).

Note: Most of these improvements might not be carried out, but these are what I have in mind to do.

8. üë®‚Äçüî¨ SAMPLE OF AN INTERACTION WITH THE CHATBOT
User: My 2-year-old has a persistent cough and wheezing.

Bot: Possible Condition: Asthma (Confidence: 0.88)

Definition: Asthma is a chronic lung condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways...

Common Symptoms:
1. Cough (especially at night)
2. Wheezing
3. Shortness of breath

Red Flags (Seek urgent care if these appear):
1. Blue lips or face
2. Severe difficulty breathing

General Advice:
1. Avoid known allergens
2. Ensure medication adherence

‚úÖ CONCLUSION

This chatbot only serves as a helpful assistant for parents, caregivers, or students learning about pediatric lung conditions. 

While it's not a replacement for medical advice, it does help to somehow bridge the gap between unstructured web searching and professional consultation.
