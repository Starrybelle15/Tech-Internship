OPHTHALMOLOGY (EYE AND VISION)
OPHTHALMOLOGY DEFINITION/DESCRIPTION
Ophthalmology is the branch of medicine that focuses on the health of the eyes, including the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of various eye diseases and conditions that may affect the eye and visual system. The term "ophthalmology" comes from the ancient Greek words "ophthalmos," meaning eye, and "logia," meaning study or discourse. This field encompasses a wide range of medical practices aimed at preserving eye health and treating various eye conditions. Ophthalmologists are medical doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating eye disorders, and they undergo extensive training that includes both medical and surgical aspects of eye care
Ophthalmology has long been on the vanguard of medicine and innovation. Ophthalmologists have enjoyed high levels of satisfaction from restoring sight to patients. But the world as we know it has shifted, and now we are burdened by the pressures of modern medicine and a competitive marketplace. Ophthalmology should take the lead in medicine in learning how to weather these crises and how to emerge a revitalized specialty. It seems that the right choice for the specialty of ophthalmology is to reclaim our role as comprehensive providers of total eye care. Ophthalmologists can lead teams formed to provide comprehensive eye care. A dialogue on a consensus definition of the scope of ophthalmology should take place, involving all segments of the profession. Another dialogue that is critical to the future of the specialty is a deliberate examination of the issue of formal accreditation and/or certification of ophthalmologic subspecialties. Ophthalmology needs to define itself for the future.
SUMMARY: Ophthalmology is a branch of medical science that deals with the structure, functions, and diseases of the eye. It includes both medical and surgical care for eye disorders and conditions. An ophthalmologist is a physician who specializes in eye care and undergoes additional training beyond medical school, including a residency in ophthalmology.
The term ophthalmology comes from the Greek roots ὀφθαλμός (ophthalmos, "eye") and -λογία (-logia, "study, discourse"), meaning "the study of eyes".
Ophthalmologists can diagnose and treat various eye diseases and conditions, including cataracts, retinal diseases, glaucoma, corneal diseases, eyelid and orbital disorders, uveitis, strabismus, ocular neoplasms, and neuro-ophthalmologic disorders.
They use various diagnostic tests such as ophthalmoscopy, visual field tests, and optical coherence tomography to assess and treat eye conditions.
Ophthalmology has a long history, with significant contributions from ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and modern advancements in technology and medical knowledge.
In summary, ophthalmology addresses a broad spectrum of eye diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, amblyopia, strabismus, retinal disorders, uveitis, keratoconus, and many others affecting vision and eye health.
These conditions can be managed with proper diagnosis and treatment, often including medications, surgery, or corrective lenses. Regular eye exams are important for early detection and management of these conditions.
EYE AND VISUAL DISEASES
CAUSES 
Eye and visual diseases can be caused by various factors, including age-related changes, genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and underlying health conditions.
Age-related changes are a significant cause of eye and visual diseases. As people age, the lens of the eye can become less flexible, leading to presbyopia, and the vitreous fluid may shrink, causing floaters or retinal detachment.
Additionally, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can develop, affecting the central vision needed for reading and driving.
Genetic factors can also play a role in the development of eye diseases. For example, refractive errors like astigmatism, farsightedness (hyperopia), and nearsightedness (myopia) can be influenced by family history.
Environmental factors, such as exposure to UV light and chemicals, can contribute to eye diseases; prolonged exposure to UV light can increase the risk of cataracts and AMD; Chemical exposure can damage the cornea and lead to conditions like keratitis.
Underlying health conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, can also affect eye health. Diabetes can cause diabetic retinopathy, which damages blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision loss.
High blood pressure can cause damage to the blood vessels in the retina, leading to hypertensive retinopathy.
In some cases, the cause of eye diseases may be unknown, referred to as idiopathic.
Regular eye exams are essential for early detection and treatment of eye diseases, especially as people age.
Rare eye conditions that ophthalmologists treat include mitochondrial myopathy, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and hypothyroidism, which can affect eye movements and vision.

LIST OF DISEASES THAT MAY AFFECT THE EYE AND VISUALS
Ophthalmology is a medical specialty that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, conditions, and eye disorders affecting the eye and visual system. It encompasses a wide range of diseases and conditions, including cataracts, retinal diseases, glaucoma, corneal diseases, and uveitis, among others. It also covers both medical and surgical treatment of these diseases, including medication, laser therapy, and surgical interventions to preserve or restore vision.
Diseases under ophthalmology encompass a wide range of eye conditions affecting various parts of the eye, including the lens, retina, optic nerve, cornea, and more. 
Cataracts are a common age-related condition where the lens of the eye becomes cloudy, leading to blurred vision. Retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, can cause vision loss due to damage to the retina. Glaucoma is a group of diseases that damage the optic nerve, often due to increased pressure within the eye.
Other significant diseases include corneal diseases, which affect the cornea's ability to function properly, and uveitis, an inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. Additionally, ophthalmology also addresses eyelid and orbital disorders, strabismus, and neuro-ophthalmologic disorders.
These diseases often require specialized diagnosis and management by ophthalmologists, including medical, laser, or surgical treatments to preserve or restore vision.

ACHROMATOPSIA
Other Names for This Condition • Achromatism • Rod monochromatism • Total color blindness 
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
Achromatopsia is a condition characterized by a partial or total absence of color vision. People with complete achromatopsia cannot perceive any colors; they see only black, white, and shades of gray. Incomplete achromatopsia is a milder form of the condition that allows some color discrimination. Achromatopsia also involves other problems with vision, including an increased sensitivity to light and glare (photophobia), involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus), and significantly reduced sharpness of vision (low visual acuity). Affected individuals can also have farsightedness (hyperopia) or, less commonly, nearsightedness (myopia). These vision problems develop in the first few months of life. Achromatopsia is different from the more common forms of color vision deficiency (also called color blindness), in which people can perceive color but have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors, such as red and green. Frequency Achromatopsia affects an estimated 1 in 30,000 people worldwide. Complete achromatopsia is more common than incomplete achromatopsia. Complete achromatopsia occurs frequently among Pingelapese islanders, who live on one of the Eastern Caroline Islands of Micronesia. Between 4 and 10 percent of people in this population have a total absence of color vision
CAUSES OF ACHROMATOPSIA
Achromatopsia results from changes in one of several genes: CNGA3, CNGB3, GNAT2, PDE6C, or PDE6H. A particular CNGB3 gene mutation underlies the condition in Pingelapese islanders. Achromatopsia is a disorder of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The retina contains two types of light receptor cells, called rods and cones. These cells transmit visual signals from the eye to the brain through a process called phototransduction. Rods provide vision in low light (night vision). Cones provide vision in bright light (daylight vision), including color vision. 1 Reprinted from MedlinePlus Genetics (https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/) Mutations in any of the genes listed above prevent cones from reacting appropriately to light, which interferes with phototransduction. In people with complete achromatopsia, cones are nonfunctional, and vision depends entirely on the activity of rods. The loss of cone function leads to a total lack of color vision and causes the other vision problems. People with incomplete achromatopsia retain some cone function. These individuals have limited color vision, and their other vision problems tend to be less severe. Some people with achromatopsia do not have identified mutations in any of the known genes. In these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Other genetic factors that have not been identified likely contribute to this condition.
RISK FACTORS OF ACHROMATOPSIA
Signs and symptoms
DIAGNOSIS METHODS
Achromatopsia should be suspected in individuals with the following typical clinical findings, additional testing, and family history.
Clinical findings
Pendular nystagmus
Increased sensitivity to light (photophobia)
Eccentric fixation
Reduced visual acuity
Reduced or complete lack of color discrimination
Small central scotoma
Fundus appearance: normal in many affected individuals, but can show subtle bilateral macular changes such as absence of the foveal reflex, pigment mottling, or narrowing of the retinal vessels. Frank atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the fovea can occur in older individuals.
Additional testing
Color vision tests. The color perception of individuals with achromatopsia (achromats) is unreliable; many achromats learn to associate certain colors with objects and to recognize some colors by discerning differences in brightness. In general, all achromats have anomalous (impaired) color discrimination along all three axes of color vision corresponding to the three cone classes: the protan or long-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (red), the deutan or middle-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (green), and the tritan or short-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (blue). The following results are found on standard testing for color vision:
Generally, no specific axis of color confusion is found on the Farnsworth Munsell 100-hue test.
An achromat axis (in which the constituent color chips are arranged according to their rod-perceived lightness) is characteristic for complete achromatopsia on both the saturated and desaturated versions of the Panel D-15 test.
The most important and diagnostic test is red-green color discrimination with the Rayleigh anomaloscope equation. Although a complete achromat can always fully color-match the spectral yellow primary to any mixture of the spectral red and green primaries, a brightness match is only possible to red primary-dominated mixtures.
Visual field testing. Small central scotomas can be demonstrated in some individuals by careful testing. However, unsteady fixation can make demonstration of a central scotoma difficult.
Electroretinogram (ERG)
Full-field ERG. The photopic response (including the 30-Hz flicker response) is absent or markedly diminished; the scotopic response is normal or mildly abnormal.
15-Hz flicker ERG. A typical finding is absence of the cone-driven fast pathway response elicited by high flash intensities 
Optical coherence tomography (OCT). A variable degree of foveal hypoplasia as well as disruption and/or loss of inner-/outer-segment junction of the photoreceptors and an attenuation of the RPE layer within the macular region can be observed at an early age 
Fundus autofluorescence imaging shows missing or variable formation of foveal hypofluorescence or a larger lesion with a surrounding hyper autofluorescence ring and a central region of absent autofluorescence corresponding to the lesion area seen on OCTAdaptive optics imaging shows remnant cone structure; however, the number and spatial distribution of the foveal cones are highly variable – the foveal cone mosaic ranges from a contiguously packed mosaic to a sparsely arranged collection of conesFamily history is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.
TREATMENT OPTIONS
Management
Currently there is no approved treatment for achromatopsia. Children should be monitored for associated high hyperopia that can be corrected with spectacles or contacts; however, a wide range of refractive errors have been reported, with myopia occurring in some patients.[17] Any underlying amblyopia can be managed with occlusion or atropine therapy. Clinical research trials, low vision and genetic counseling should be considered for patients and their families.
Genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis and provide parents with information regarding the risk to other children. A molecular diagnosis is also typically required for consideration of ongoing clinical research trials.
Prevention tips
OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
Patients typically maintain the vision that develops during childhood. Although symptomatically patients often remain stable, several studies have suggested that age-related development of foveal structural changes may indicate a slowly progressive degeneration and loss of cone photoreceptor cells in affected patients.[15] [22][23] [24]A longitudinal study of 17 patients in Italy found a slow deterioration of the macular structure in the years following diagnosis.[25] A recent study of 53 patients in the Middle East suggested no deterioration of visual acuity with age. In fact, slight improvement over time was seen. The authors note that this improvement may reflect increased maturation of attention or general cognitive abilities of younger study participants as they aged. As such, the “improvement” in vision observed may not necessarily reflect a significant improvement but rather the absence of significant deterioration.[4] Further research is warranted.
Possible complications
When to see a doctor / red flag
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Achromatopsia is readily recognized by its characteristic features (see Suggestive Findings). Conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis are congenital nystagmus (as nystagmus is usually one of the first manifestations) and cerebral achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia, which is associated with severe or total color vision deficits and can arise adventitiously after brain fever, cortical trauma, or cerebral infarction, especially involving lesions to the ventral occipital cortex [Bouvier & Engel 2006].
Inherited retinal dystrophies that may be confused with achromatopsia are summarized in Table 3 below.

Table 3.
Inherited Retinal Dystrophies to Consider in the Differential Diagnosis of Achromatopsia
AD = autosomal dominant; 
AR = autosomal recessive; 
ERG = electroretinogram; 
MOI = mode of inheritance; 
XL = X-linked
Blue-cone monochromacy may also be referred to as S-cone monochromacy or X-chromosome-linked achromatopsia.
The dysfunction of the L (red) and M (green) cones is caused by pathogenic variants leading to the loss of the X-linked red (OPN1LW) and green (OPN1MW) opsin gene array, hybrid gene formation and/or inactivating variants, or by deletions affecting the locus control region, a critical region that regulates the expression of the red/green (OPN1LW/OPN1MW) gene array.
Blue-cone monochromacy affects mostly males.
Some males with mildly defective red-green color vision may not be aware of it until they are tested. Among individuals of northern European origin, about 8% of males and 0.5% of females have red-green color vision defects; these defects are less frequent among males of African (3%-4%) or Asian (3%) origin.
Often referred to as yellow-blue disorders, although the color confusion is typically between blues & greens, tritan defects affect the S (blue) cones.

RECENT GUIDELINES, UPDATES, AND RESEARCH
Several phase I/II clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of gene therapy for achromatopsia are currently ongoing. A list can be found through clinicaltrials.gov: Achromatopsia trials.
Gene therapy is emerging as a promising therapeutic tool across medicine and particularly in the field of inherited retinal diseases. Achromatopsia may be a particularly suitable condition for gene therapy as the structural loss of dysfunctional cone photoreceptors occurs relatively late in the disease course. Cone photoreceptors are therefore available for transduction over a longer time period, in contrast to other inherited retinal dystrophies with earlier outer retinal degeneration. A series of 9 patients, published in April of 2020, was found to have promising results following subretinal adenoviral gene therapy targeting CNGA3, with cone photoreceptor activation and improved vision in some adult patients.[18] Some remaining challenges for gene therapy include genetic heterogeneity, surgical challenges in young eyes, development of amblyopia prior to treatment, and need for long-term efficacy.
For patients with the ATF6 mutation, a small trial at Columbia will be investigating glycerol phenylbutyrate (PBA).
Low vision
Referral to a low vision specialist can be considered, where tinted glasses or contacts can help with debilitating hemeralopia and individualized training can help patients function with low vision.[19][20] Glasses that are reported to help with color discrimination are currently under investigation, but primarily in red-green color deficiencies.[21] Electronic devices that aid with color discrimination are also being investigated. The use of filters of light to reduce photophobia is also being tested and may involve reducing the stimulation of photoreceptors.
Genetic counseling
The disease is autosomal recessive and referral to a genetic counselor should be considered for patients and family members.
If possible, include statistics or epidemiology data (e.g., how common it is, affected demographics).

ADIE’S PUPIL
Adie’s pupil is also known as tonic pupil or Holmes-Adie pupil.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
This is a neurological disorder—a type of disease that affects the nervous system. The nervous system—made up of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves—controls many of our involuntary bodily functions. These are reflexive actions that happen automatically, without having to think about them—things like sweating, salivating, and sneezing. 
The nervous system also controls the pupil (small hole in the center of the iris) and its response to light. Normally, the pupil constricts (gets smaller) in brighter light to let less light in. In lower light, the pupil dilates (widens) to let more light in, so we can see better. 
With Adie’s pupil, there is an abnormal pupillary response to light. In most cases, it affects only one eye. The affected pupil is usually larger than normal and does not constrict as it should in the presence of bright light. 
CAUSES
What Causes Adie’s Pupil? 
No one knows for sure what causes Adie’s pupil. Most doctors think it’s caused by a viral or bacterial infection that damages the nerves that control the pupil. Some think it may be caused by autoimmune disease, when the body’s immune system attacks its own healthy tissues, like the nerves that operate the pupil.
RISK FACTORS
SYMPTOMS / SIGNS
Symptoms of Adie’s pupil can include having: 
a pupil that is larger than the other 
a pupil that doesn’t get smaller in bright light 
light sensitivity 
blurry vision 
difficulty reading (with Adie’s pupil, the eye has a hard time focusing for near tasks) 
Rarely, both eyes are affected. And sometimes, Adie’s pupil has the opposite effect on a patient’s pupil(s), where they fail to widen adequately in low light situations. 
There are also some non-eye related symptoms that are common with Adie’s pupil, including: 
excessive sweating 
not having a knee-jerk reflex 
DIAGNOSIS METHOD
Adie’s pupil can usually be diagnosed during an eye exam with your ophthalmologist. The exam may include: 
Special diagnostic eye drops. Your ophthalmologist gives you these drops to see how the pupil responds. A pupil with Adie’s will get smaller after using these drops. 
A slit-lamp exam. This device magnifies and illuminates your pupils. Seen close-up, the pupils may show signs of Adie’s. 
Pupil response testing. Your doctor will want to see how your pupil responds to bright light and low light. These responses are then compared to the unaffected eye. They may also test to see how the pupil accommodates, or focuses, on an object placed very close to the eye. 
In some cases, your ophthalmologist will want you to see a neurologist. A neurologist is a doctor with special training in diseases of the nervous system. 
TREATMENT OPTIONS
How is Adie’s Pupil Treated? 
There is no cure for Adie’s pupil, but there are ways to relieve some of the symptoms. Your doctor may suggest: 
glasses to improve reading or near vision 
sunglasses to reduce light sensitivity 
eye drops to make pupil(s) smaller and reduce light sensitivity. Eye drops can also reduce glare while driving at night. 
Depending on the cause, some people with Adie’s may recover their normal pupillary response. In others, pupillary function is never recovered or never fully recovered. It is helpful to know the disease is not life-threatening, and with proper treatment, those with Adie’s pupil can manage their condition and expect to live full and healthy lives. 
PREVENTION TIPS
PROGNOSIS 
Adie syndrome does not have a progressive course. It is not a life-threatening condition and does not cause disabilities. It is not associated with any mortality rate. The loss of deep tendon reflexes is permanent and may progress over time. Most patients require reassurance after confirmation of the diagnosis. There have been rare associations of angle-closure glaucoma with Adie pupil. The accommodative paresis gets better spontaneously over time. The pupil light reaction becomes weaker over time with an increasing light-near dissociation, and the pupil becomes smaller with time ("little old Adie") 
POSSIBLE COMPLICATION 
Adie syndrome may rarely result in angle-closure glaucoma that leads to episodes of blurring of vision and ocular pain. Management includes medical treatment to lower the intraocular pressure and laser iridotomy to prevent pupillary block. 
Previously, Adie syndrome has also been reported to result in amblyopia in children due to the conversion of latent hypermetropia into manifest hypermetropia as a result of accommodative paresis. This has been effectively managed by correction of the refractive error and occlusion therapy. 
WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR / RED FLAG
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 
The differential diagnoses of Adie syndrome include other causes of light-near dissociation such as Argyll Robertson pupil that is found in late-stage syphilis and is associated with miosis. Other causes of mydriasis including pharmacological dilation which lacks light-near dissociation, oculomotor nerve palsy which may be associated with ophthalmoplegia and ptosis, and optic nerve diseases which are associated with a relative afferent pupillary defect and diminution of vision should be excluded. 
Systemic autonomic neuropathies like Ross and harlequin syndromes can also affect the ciliary ganglion and produce the tonic pupil. Ross syndrome is characterized by a triad of a tonic pupil, hyporeflexia, and segmental anhidrosis. Harlequin syndrome is a rare disorder of the sympathetic nervous system characterized by the unilateral decrease or absence of flushing and sweating with an exaggerated response on the contralateral normal side, particularly in the face, neck, arm, and chest in response to heat, exercise, or emotional factors.Some patients (13% in one series) also have a tonic pupil, although a Horner syndrome is more common and may coexist with a tonic pupil. 
Little old Adie with a miotic pupil should be differentiated from other causes of miosis. Horner syndrome is another cause of a miotic pupil, however, ptosis and apparent enophthalmos are usually present. Miosis may also be present as an early sign in temporal lobe herniation following head injury due to oculomotor nerve irritation, which is known as Hutchison's stage I. This, however, is usually followed by pupillary dilatation. 

RECENT GUIDELINES OR UPDATES
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
The incidence of Adie syndrome is approximately 4.7/100,000 population/year with a prevalence of two cases/1000 population (approximately). Young adults usually between the ages of 25 to 45 (mean age of 32 years) are most commonly affected. There is a female predominance (2.6:1). Sporadic Adie syndrome is commonly reported with rare reports of familial association. It is unilateral in 80% of the cases. The exact incidence and prevalence rates have not been reported.

AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD)
Age-related macular degeneration is also known as macular degeneration. DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
This is a disease that damages the sharp and central vision, affecting the ability to see objects clearly, read, or drive. Degeneration of the central retina (macula) causing loss of central vision, common in older adults.
Two Types of Macular Degeneration
There are two types of Macular degeneration:
WET AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION 
This form is less common but much more serious. Wet AMD is when new, abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina. These vessels may leak blood or other fluids, causing scarring of the macula. You lose vision faster with wet AMD than with dry AMD. 
Many people don’t realize they have AMD until their vision is very blurry. This is why it is important to have regular visits to an ophthalmologist. They can look for early signs of AMD before you have any vision problems.

2. DRY MACULAR DEGENERATION
Dry macular degeneration is an eye condition that causes blurred vision or reduced central vision. It is caused by the breakdown of a part of the retina known as the macula (MAK-u-luh). The macula is responsible for central vision. This condition is common among people over 50. 
Dry macular degeneration may start in one eye then develop in the other eye. It also may develop in both eyes at the same time. Over time, vision may worsen and affect the ability to do things, such as read, drive and recognize faces. But having dry macular degeneration doesn't mean you'll lose all your sight. Vision loss is typically central, and people retain their side vision. Some people have only mild central vision loss. In others, it can be more severe. 
This form is quite common. About 80 percent (8 out of 10) of people who have AMD have the dry form. Dry AMD is when parts of the macula get thinner with age and tiny clumps of protein called drusen grow. People with dry AMD may have drusen, pigment abnormalities, or geographic atrophy (an area of cell loss in the retina). You slowly lose central vision. 
Early detection and self-care measures may delay vision loss caused by dry macular degeneration.  
CAUSES 
No one knows exactly what causes dry macular degeneration. Research suggests that it may be a combination of genes and other factors, including smoking, obesity and diet. 
The condition develops as the eye ages. Dry macular degeneration affects the macula. The macula is the area of the retina that's responsible for clear vision in the direct line of sight. Over time, tissue in the macula may thin and lose cells responsible for vision.  
RISK FACTORS
Factors that may increase the risk of macular degeneration include: 
Age. This disease is most common in people over 50. 
Family history and genetics. This disease has a hereditary component, meaning it runs in families. Researchers have identified several genes linked to the condition. 
Race. Macular degeneration is more common in white people. 
Smoking. Smoking cigarettes or being exposed to tobacco smoke on a regular basis greatly increases the risk of macular degeneration. 
Obesity. Research suggests that obesity may increase the chance that early or intermediate macular degeneration will progress to the more serious form of the disease. 
Cardiovascular disease. If you have heart or blood vessel disease, called cardiovascular disease, you may be at higher risk of macular degeneration. 
 
SYMPTOMS
Dry macular degeneration symptoms usually develop gradually and without pain. They may include: 
Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent. 
Reduced central vision in one or both eyes. 
The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work. 
Increased difficulty adapting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater. 
Increased blurriness of printed words. 
Difficulty recognizing faces. 
A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision. 
Dry macular degeneration can affect one or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness. 
Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years. The wet type is more likely to cause a relatively sudden change in vision resulting in serious vision loss. 
DIAGNOSIS METHODS
An eye care professional may diagnose dry macular degeneration by reviewing medical and family history and doing a complete eye exam. Other tests may be done, including: 
Examination of the back of the eye. An eye doctor puts drops in the eyes to dilate them and uses a special tool to examine the back of the eye. The eye doctor looks for a mottled appearance that's caused by yellow deposits that form under the retina, called drusen. People with macular degeneration often have many drusen. 
A test for changes in the center of the vision field. An Amsler grid may be used to test for changes in the center of the vision field. If you have macular degeneration, some of the straight lines in the grid may look faded, broken or distorted. 
Fluorescein angiography. During this test, an eye doctor injects a dye into a vein in the arm. The dye travels to and highlights the blood vessels in the eye. A special camera takes pictures as the dye travels through the blood vessels. The images may show retinal or blood vessel changes. 
Indocyanine green angiography. Like fluorescein angiography, this test uses an injected dye. It may be used alongside a fluorescein angiogram to identify specific types of macular degeneration. 
Optical coherence tomography. This noninvasive imaging test displays detailed cross sections of the retina. It identifies areas of thinning, thickening or swelling. These can be caused by fluid buildup from leaking blood vessels in and under the retina. 

TREATMENT OPTIONS 
For now, there's no way to reverse damage from dry macular degeneration. However, there are many clinical trials in progress. If the condition is diagnosed early, you can take steps to help slow its progression, such as taking vitamin supplements, eating healthy and not smoking. 
Vitamin supplements 
For people with intermediate or advanced disease, taking a high-dose formulation of antioxidant vitamins and minerals may help reduce the risk of vision loss. Research from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) has shown benefit in a formulation that includes: 
500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C. 
400 international units (IU) of vitamin E. 
10 mg of lutein. 
2 mg of zeaxanthin. 
80 mg of zinc as zinc oxide. 
2 mg of copper as cupric oxide. 
The evidence doesn't show benefit in taking these supplements for people with early-stage dry macular degeneration. Ask your eye doctor if taking supplements is right for you. 
Low vision rehabilitation 
Age-related macular degeneration doesn't affect your side vision and typically doesn't cause total blindness. But it can reduce or eliminate central vision. You need central vision to read, drive and recognize people's faces. It may help for you to get care from a low vision rehabilitation specialist, an occupational therapist, your eye doctor and others trained in low vision rehabilitation. They can help you find ways to adapt to your changing vision. 
Surgery to implant a telescopic lens 
For some people with advanced dry macular degeneration in both eyes, an option to improve vision may be surgery to implant a telescopic lens in one eye. The telescopic lens, which looks like a tiny plastic tube, has lenses that magnify your field of vision. The telescopic lens implant may improve both distance and close-up vision, but it has a very narrow field of view. It can be useful in urban settings as an aid to see street signs. 
Lifestyle and home remedies 
Even after receiving a diagnosis of dry macular degeneration, these steps may help slow vision loss. 
Don't smoke. If you smoke, ask a healthcare professional for help quitting. 
Choose a healthy diet. The antioxidant vitamins in fruits and vegetables contribute to eye health. Kale, spinach, broccoli, squash and other vegetables have high levels of antioxidants, including lutein and zeaxanthin. These nutrients may benefit people with macular degeneration. 
Eating foods with high levels of zinc also may be helpful for people with macular degeneration. These include high-protein foods, such as beef, pork and lamb. Non-meat sources include milk, cheese, yogurt, whole-grain cereals and whole-wheat bread. 
Another good choice is healthy unsaturated fat, such as in olive oil. And research studies have shown that a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as in salmon, tuna and walnuts, may lower the risk of advanced age-related macular degeneration. But the same benefit is not shown from taking omega-3 supplements, such as fish oil pills. 
Manage your other medical conditions. If you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, for example, take your medicine and follow your healthcare team's instructions for controlling the condition. 
Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly. If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day. 
Have routine eye exams. Ask your eye doctor about the recommended schedule for follow-up exams. In between checkups, you can do a self-assessment of your vision using an Amsler grid. These steps will help tell you if your condition develops into wet macular degeneration, which can be treated with medicines. 
 
Should you take nutritional supplements for AMD? 
Talk with your ophthalmologist about whether nutritional supplements are recommended for you. Here are some topics to discuss: 
Your chance of getting advanced AMD. Studies show that nutritional supplements might help people with early to intermediate AMD who are at risk for developing advanced AMD. 
Eye-healthy foods. Studies show that nutritional supplements alone are not enough to prevent or delay advanced AMD. You also should eat a healthy, balanced diet. This includes dark leafy greens (like spinach and kale) along with yellow, orange and other colorful fruits and vegetables. Eating fatty fish like salmon may also lower your risk of early or advanced AMD. 
Benefits and risks of nutritional supplements. Taking nutritional supplements can be helpful, but there can be possible health risks. For example, a type of vitamin B3 called nicotinamide is being studied for its potential benefits for people with glaucoma but it may also cause severe liver injury. Talk with your ophthalmologist and primary care doctor about how the vitamins and minerals listed above might affect you. 
 
PREVENTION TIPS
It's important to have routine eye exams to identify early signs of macular degeneration. The following measures may help reduce the risk of developing dry macular degeneration: 
Manage all medical conditions. For example, if you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your healthcare team's instructions for controlling the condition. 
Don't smoke. People who smoke are more likely to develop macular degeneration than are people who don't smoke. Ask a healthcare professional for help stopping smoking. 
Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly. If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day. 
Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. These foods contain antioxidant vitamins that reduce your risk of developing macular degeneration. 
Include fish in your diet. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, may reduce the risk of macular degeneration. Nuts such as walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids 

Prognosis
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS 
People whose dry macular degeneration has progressed to central vision loss have a higher risk of depression and social isolation. With profound loss of vision, people may see visual hallucinations. This condition is called Charles Bonnet syndrome. Dry macular degeneration may progress to wet macular degeneration, which can quickly cause complete vision loss if left untreated.
WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR 
See your eye care professional if: 
You notice changes, such as distortion or blind spots, in your central vision. 
You lose the ability to see fine detail. 
These changes may be the first sign of macular degeneration, particularly if you're over age 60.  
With AMD you lose your central vision. You cannot see fine details, whether you are looking at something close or far. But your peripheral (side) vision will still be normal. For instance, imagine you are looking at a clock that has hands. With AMD, you might see the clock’s numbers but not the hands. 
AMD is very common. It is a leading cause of vision loss in people 50 years or older. 
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 
Reticular pseudodrusen should be differentiated from drusen. The former are deposits above the RPE that are in the subretinal plane. 
Fundus features of dry ARMD should also be differentiated from adult vitelliform macular dystrophy and retinal drug toxicity. Fundus in adult vitelliform dystrophy reveals yellowish subretinal deposits, whereas RPE pigmentary changes due to drugs like hydroxychloroquine, deferoxamine, and cisplatin can mimic the seen in Dry ARMD. 
Neovascular AMD should be differentiated from retinal angiomatous proliferation and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Retinal angiomatous proliferation is also known as type 3 CNVM, where the neovascularization begins within the retina and then progresses towards the RPE and choroid. On FFA, early phases reveal a retinal vessel dipping perpendicularly into the CNVM component, indicating the retinochoroidal anastomosis.  
Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy can be differentiated on fundus examination by the presence of orangish nodules along with subretinal hemorrhage or fluid. OCT shows large choroidal vessels, also known as pachy vessels, in these cases. The choroid is thickened, unlike ARMD, where the choroid is thin. ICGA shows polyps that are diagnostic of PCV. 
RECOMMENDATION 
Here are some important points to remember: 
ARMD is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly age group. 
Regular follow up in cases of early ARMD can help in the timely recognition of signs of progression and facilitate initiation of treatment.  
With the advent of SD-OCT, the follow up of these patients has improved significantly. Various prognostic markers that have been identified on SD-OCT are useful clinically in decision making regarding treatment and patient education and counseling regarding the visual prognosis. 
Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections have largely replaced all the other treatment modalities. The visual acuity achieved at the end of the treatment period is much better than that achieved with the laser. Patients' quality of life has improved. With treat and extend regimen being used widely, the burden of the cost of injections, as well as the number of visits to the hospital, have reduced significantly.  
Low vision aids are very helpful in rehabilitating the patients who progress to blindness despite treatment.  
The disease is a bilateral process that makes the patient dependent and affects the quality of life.  
The cost of intravitreal injections is a burden for the patient.  
Regular follow up in cases of monthly dosing also increases the number of visits to the hospital. 

EPIDEMIOLOGY 
The disease is estimated to affect around 196 million people by 2020 and 288 million people by 2040. Early AMD is more common in individuals of European ancestry than in Asians, whereas the prevalence of late AMD is the same between the two populations. In 2015, AMD was the fourth most common cause of blindness globally and the third most common cause for moderate to severe vision loss. This shows the increasing importance of AMD globally.

ALBINISM
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Albinism is also known as “achromia”, “achromasia”, and “achromatosis”
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
When someone has albinism, their body has trouble creating pigment. Pigment is the material in the body that produces color. People with albinism have a reduced amount or absence of pigment in their eyes, hair and skin. 
There are two basic types of albinism, both of which cause vision problems, including low vision. One type of albinism is called oculocutaneous albinism or OCA. OCA causes someone to have decreased pigment in the eyes, hair, and skin. 
The second type of albinism is called ocular albinism. Ocular albinism mainly affects the eyes. The skin and hair are of normal or near-normal color. Because a child with ocular albinism does not have any outward difference in appearance, eye problems may be the first symptoms of albinism. 
CAUSES
What causes albinism? 
Albinism is caused by a genetic mutation that is usually passed from parents to children. The mutation disrupts the production of melanin, the pigment that protects the skin from UV rays. Melanin is also important for the proper development of the eye. Without melanin, the retina and the optic nerve may not develop properly. The retina (the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye) and the optic nerve fibers help relay images to the brain.
RISK FACTORS
Who is at risk for albinism? 
Albinism is an inherited genetic disorder. Usually, both parents must carry the albinism gene to have a child with albinism. The albinism gene is a recessive gene, meaning that a child has to receive a copy from both parents to have the disorder. If the child gets a copy of the gene from just one parent, he or she will not have symptoms of albinism. If both parents carry the gene, there is a one-in-four chance with each pregnancy that the baby will be born with albinism. 
One type of albinism, called X-linked ocular albinism, is usually inherited from the mother. In this case, the gene for albinism is located on an X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism appears almost exclusively in males. The gene for it is passed from mothers (who carry it without developing the condition) to their sons. The mothers generally have normal vision. For each son born to a mother who carries the gene, there is a one-in-two chance of having X-linked ocular albinism. 
Albinism occurs in about one in 17,000 births. 
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS (Albinism symptoms)
Albinism can cause a wide range of eye problems. Not all people with albinism have a noticeable lack of color in their skin or hair. So eye problems may be the first sign of albinism. 
Some of the symptoms include: 
Nystagmus (when someone's eyes move rapidly and uncontrollably) 
Strabismus (misaligned eyes) 
Sensitivity to bright light (photophobia) 
Refractive errors, including farsightedness (hyperopia), nearsightedness (myopia) and astigmatism 
Foveal hypoplasia. A condition in which the retina does not develop normally before birth and during infancy 
An optic nerve problem. When nerve signals sent from the retina through the optic nerve to the brain do not follow the usual nerve routes; and 
An iris problem. When the colored area in the center of the eye does not have enough pigment to screen out stray light coming into the eye. 
People with albinism can have vision that ranges from normal to severe vision impairment. Near vision is often better than distance vision. Generally, those who have the least amount of pigment have the poorest vision. 
DIAGNOSIS METHODS
To diagnose albinism, an ophthalmologist will give you a thorough eye examination. He or she will look for nystagmus, strabismus and photophobia. Any one of these conditions by itself is not necessarily a sign of albinism. An ophthalmologist will also look at the retina and iris to see if they have developed as they should. 
ALBINISM TREATMENT OPTIONS
Albinism itself has no treatment. But some conditions that people with albinism have are treatable. Other conditions related to albinism are manageable. 
For example, strabismus can be treated with glasses or surgery. Glasses can also help improve vision and reduce light sensitivity. For children with low vision, low vision aids such as hand-held magnifiers can help. Glasses with small telescopes attached are helpful for older children and adults. These lenses can help with both close and distant vision. 
Parents and teachers can work together to help a child with albinism. It's important to consider seating, lighting and optical aids in the classroom. These can make learning easier for a child with albinism. Some students with albinism may benefit from having a teacher for the visually impaired (or TVI). 
Peer support groups can help children and adults with albinism. These groups can help the individual to: 
feel less isolated 
learn positive attitudes and coping skills from others with low vision;
gather valuable resource information. 

Prevention tips
OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS 
Life expectancy within the non-syndromic OCA population is comparable to the general population. There is an increased mortality risk due to skin cancer. This risk changes based on the amount of relative sun exposure in a geographic area and certain socio economic issues. These socioeconomic issues include limited access to sunscreen, limited education on sun-protective measures, cultural differences in dress, limited access to healthcare professionals for surveillance leading to late presentation and late treatment, inability to comply with or complete treatment courses. In these same lower socioeconomic regions, there is often a palpable stigma associated with albinism, and the afflicted may be victims of persecution, prejudice, and violence. Some albinos have even been murdered as their organs are highly valued on the black market. Albinos have normal intelligence compared with the general population. There is some delayed visual maturation, and this can lead to educational delay if not addressed early enough. Furthermore, poor self-image and social alienation can lead to feelings of isolation and depression. Albinos do have an increased rate of attention deficit disorder. 
 
POSSIBLE COMPLICATION 
Visual deficits can lead to the following: 
Limited work opportunities where a minimum visual acuity is required 
Difficulty in reading due to uncorrected visual deficits that may lead to educational delays 
Inability to obtain driver’s license due to visual impairment 
Infection risk in Chediak-Higashi syndrome 
Bleeding Diathesis in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 
Solar damage: Pachydermia (coarse, rough, thick skin), actinic keratoses, solar lentigines (in non-OCA1A albinos), solar erythema 
Malignancy: Basal and squamous cell carcinomas (BCC, SCC). SCC is by far the most common malignancy reported among albinos (representing more than 75% of cases of malignancy), developing as early as the teens. One study found that more than 70% of them were diagnosed in the head and neck areas.  Another study found the head, face, and hands equally affected at approximately 20% each. Albinism increases the relative risk of SCC as much as 1000 times, at least in the African population. Cumulative sun exposure is the major risk factor, with the incidence of cancers increasing with patient age. BCC accounts for about 24% of malignancies, with the remaining 1% being melanoma. Melanomas are rare in albinos with only a few case reports in the literature, despite melanocytes still being present in the skin in the same relative number.  Surprisingly, melanomas often occur in non-exposed areas, which speaks against UV-radiation being the culprit.  Practitioners need to have a high level of suspicion since these lesions are both rare and tend to be amelanotic in albinos.

RECENT GUIDELINES OR UPDATES 
Due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and signs of OCA and OA, a multidisciplinary team approach involving Ophthalmologist and Dermatologist is required in assessing and managing patients with albinism. Children with albinism should undergo cycloplegic refraction to ensure prompt correction of refractive error. Careful assessment of nystagmus is also essential, noting its plane, axis of oscillation, conjugacy, frequency and amplitude. Modern video-based eye movement recordings can help in analyzing the nystagmus waveform and characteristics. AHP when the null zone is not in the primary position can be objectively measured using torticollometer, Harms’ wall and orthopedic goniometer. Accurate measurement of deviation using prism cover tests is also crucial as patients with albinism often have strabismus. Other investigations include VEPs, which would show misrouting of visual pathways with abnormally high numbers of temporal fibers decussating at the optic chiasm. The International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision standard recommended multichannel ‘onset-offset’ pattern VEP presented with a field of 30 degrees to record chiasmal misrouting. OCT is another valuable tool to assess the degree of foveal hypoplasia, which is graded using the Leicester Grading System 
Differentiating subtypes of albinism based on clinical presentation alone is challenging due to overlapping clinical features. Thus, genetic testing is helpful in confirming clinical suspicion, obtaining an accurate diagnosis and can aid in discussing prognosis and genetic counseling. This includes the differences in prognosis between syndromic forms compared to non-syndromic forms and searching for systemic phenotypes in syndromic OCA. Prior to genetic testing, a detailed family history should be taken, with attention to relatives with clinical manifestations of OCA and OA. Molecular genetic testing approaches can include a combination of targeted testing (multigene panel and chromosomal microarray) and comprehensive genomic testing (exome sequencing of genome sequencing). The genetic information on causative pathologic variants is important for carrier testing of family members, prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling. Issues related to genetic counseling that need to be explored further include family planning, DNA banking and prenatal testing   
One of the challenges in obtaining a genetic diagnosis of albinism has been due to missing heritability or incomplete genetic diagnosis (where only one pathogenic TYR variant is identified). However, work by Gronskov et al. highlighted that a pathogenic haplotype (the allele p.S192Y-p.R402Q in cis, (also referred to as ‘cis-YQ’)) is a significant contributor to the disease and is common in Europeans. They suggest that these variants in combination may have an additive effect. This has been verified by other groups. Michaud et al. suggested that a promoter variant had a significant role in the pathogenesis of TYR associated albinism, however a recent study by Loftus et al. did not find a difference in TYR mRNA expression in primary melanocytes between the different promoter genotypes. To identify the pathogenic haplotype, phasing of TYR variants is recommended. This is a scenario where long-read sequencing could help resolve whether the pathogenic haplotype is present. If there is still missing heritability, investigating for structural variants is recommended recommended.ly in carriers with albinism, phenotypic manifestations have also been reported. 
Recent advances in genetics offer the possibility of precise diagnosis. This includes the application of adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy for OA1, which showed positive outcomes in animal models. Gene editing of TYR gene with the CRISPR-associated nuclease protein (CRISPR/Cas9) system was also demonstrated on animal level by Song et al. More recently, a patient-derived stem cell model for studying eye conditions related to OCA was developed. This is believed to be an important step forward in understanding albinism and testing potential therapies to treat it. Investigating albinism in some animal models may be limited as they lack fovea. 
Management of albinism at present usually includes supportive treatment aimed at optimizing vision, managing and addressing clinical manifestations especially photophobia, protecting retina from ultraviolet rays and reducing related complications such as skin cancers. Correction of refractive error using spectacles and/or contact lenses to reduce the risk of amblyopia is essential. When considering the choice of contact lenses, soft contact lenses were associated with worse visual acuity compared to rigid gas permeable lenses and spectacles in a randomized controlled trial. Patients with albinism may have nystagmus which could cause misalignment of the toric soft contact lenses resulting in blurred vision. Some patients with albinism also do not find refractive correction helpful as their vision was limited by foveal hypoplasia. In cases of poor vision, low visual aids are helpful. Nystagmus, strabismus and AHP can be managed by prism glasses or surgery. The Anderson-Kestenbaum procedure is an effective surgical approach to move null points to correct AHP. However, there may be a higher risk of non-optimal success after surgery among patients with albinism due to poor fusion secondary to lower visual acuity and nystagmus . Tinted glasses or contact lenses can help to improve glare . Individuals with albinism should be advised to wear sun protective clothing and apply sunscreens outdoors. Psychosocial and educational support should also be provided to individuals with albinism 
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
Occurrence is estimated at 1:17,000 to 1:20,000 overall. Approximately one in 70 individuals carry an OCA-mutated allele, with the OCA2 mutation being the most common worldwide. OCA2 is common in sub-Saharan Africa since cultural norms permit consanguineous marriages, allowing prevalence reach 1 in 1000 and a phenomenon called pseudo-dominance where the recessive allele burden is so high in a given family, that the recessive trait is disproportionately represented. The prevalence of individual forms of albinism are included below: 
OCA1: Prevalence is 1 in 40,000 worldwide but one of the most common forms in America and China (70% of cases) 
OCA2: The most common worldwide (1:39,000). Prevalence as follows: African Americans (1:10,000), overall Americans (1:36,000), Sub-Saharan Africa (1:3,900)  
OCA3: Prevalence is 1: 8500 of African individuals primarily in southern Africa.  It can also be seen in Pakistani, German, Indian, and Japanese populations. 
OCA4: Prevalence is 1:100,000 but accounts for 24% of Japanese OCA.  It is also described in German, Turkish, Indian, Korean, Chinese, Danish, and Moroccan populations.  
OCA5: Very rare, only mentioned in a case report of a Pakistani family 
OCA6: Very rare, case reports in a Chinese family and a man from eastern India 
OCA7: Very rare, consanguineous Faroese family 
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS): Prevalence is 1:500,000 worldwide but 1:1800 in Puerto Rico 
Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS): Very rare (less than 500 cases published in the past 20 years) 
Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS): Prevalence of AS (1:12,000 to 20,000) and PWS (1:15,000) are higher than the OCAs. However, only approximately 1% of AS and PWS sufferers have contiguous gene deletions that lead to OCA2-like presentation 
Ocular albinism (OA1): Prevalence is 1:50,000

ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE 
Another name for Alzheimer’s disease is “dementia and the eye”.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
The brain has a critical role in taking the visual information your eye gathers and putting it together into a picture that you can understand. This relationship between brain tissue and eye tissue is an area of intense interest for ophthalmologists and neurologists.  
How Are Neurological Diseases Connected to the Eye? 
Research shows that diseases and conditions of the brain can also affect the eyes because the optic nerve and retina are actually brain tissue that extends outside the brain case. Alzheimer's disease and dementia, which are caused by damage to brain cells, both appear to have effects on the retina. 
We don't yet have eye tests that can help us diagnose or understand dementia, but current research shows exciting potential. Studies show a clear relationship between brain tissue and eye tissue and point toward future areas of research. 
Could We See Alzheimer’s Disease Through the Eye? 
Alzheimer's disease is caused by an abnormal build-up of proteins in the brain that kills cells and damages connections between neurons. Common symptoms include memory loss, difficulty thinking, disorientation, and other kinds of cognitive decline. Symptoms can also include vision problems, especially trouble with spatial relationships and depth perception. Some patients develop trouble reading, following moving objects, or have problems with contrast. 
There are several kinds of dementia, though Alzheimer's is the most common. It accounts for 60 to 80% of all dementia. Some people get mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in older age, which may or may not get worse with time. It can be an early stage of Alzheimer’s disease. 

Causes and risk factors
Signs and symptoms
DIAGNOSIS METHODS
Right now, Alzheimer's disease is diagnosed after a series of assessments and exams that rule out other things. These might include cognitive testing for memory and thinking, talking to family members, physical exams, and brain imaging scans. But none of these tests actually diagnose Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's disease can currently only be confirmed after death by examining brain tissue. 
The difficulty of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is driving research on the eye-brain connection. What if a detailed look at the retina could help identify early-stage brain disease? It's already known that eye exams can help diagnose systemic health issues like cardiovascular disease, risk factors for stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, and some cancers. 
TREATMENT OPTIONS
For Patients, Continue Routine Eye Care 
Though studies are encouraging, there isn’t enough information on the eye-brain connection yet to change anything for patients. If you're worried about memory loss or dementia, talk to your family doctor or see a neurologist. If you have concerns about your vision or eyes, see an ophthalmologist.

RECENT GUIDELINES OR UPDATES
New Research Points In Promising Directions 
A flurry of recent studies shows changes in the retina in people with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. These are mostly small studies, but they're setting the stage for more work. Most of these studies have shown changes in the individual layers of the retina or the blood flow within the eye. 
Many of these retinal changes are found using a quick and common test called optical coherence tomography (OCT). Many ophthalmologists have the basic equipment to do this test in their office, since it's used in evaluating several other eye diseases. But the full technology to do this kind of testing isn't yet available. 
Another recent study using a new imaging technique called fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) has measured a protein called beta-amyloid in the retina. This is one of the proteins that builds up in the brain of people with Alzheimer's. Studies also indicate eye tissue changes in people with other brain diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob (mad cow disease) and Parkinson’s disease. 

If possible, include statistics or epidemiology data (e.g., how common it is, affected demographics).

AMBLYOPIA (LAZY EYE)
ALTERNATIVE NAMES:
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
Amblyopia (Lazy Eye) is a condition where one  or both eyes does not develop normal vision during childhood, often due to misalignment of the eyes, a difference in focus between the eyes, or improper brain-eye coordination, or maybe the child’s brain learnt to ignore one of the eyes; it is often caused by strabismus or refractive differences between eyes. Reduced vision in one eye due to. One of the most common causes of vision impairment in children .
It is sometimes called “lazy eye.” Amblyopia is a common problem in babies and young children, but vision changes from amblyopia can last a lifetime. 
A child’s vision develops in the first few years of life. It is important to diagnose and treat amblyopia as early as possible. Otherwise, a child with amblyopia will not develop normal, healthy vision. 
Lazy eye (amblyopia) is reduced vision in one eye caused by abnormal visual development early in life. The weaker — or lazy — eye often wanders inward or outward. 
Amblyopia generally develops from birth up to age 7 years. It is the leading cause of decreased vision among children. Rarely, lazy eye affects both eyes. 
Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent long-term problems with your child's vision. The eye with poorer vision can usually be corrected with glasses or contact lenses, or patching therapy. 

CAUSES
Lazy eyes develop because of abnormal visual experience early in life that changes the nerve pathways between a thin layer of tissue (retina) at the back of the eye and the brain. The weaker eye receives fewer visual signals. Eventually, the eyes' ability to work together decreases, and the brain suppresses or ignores input from the weaker eye. 
Anything that blurs a child's vision or causes the eyes to cross or turn out can result in a lazy eye. Common causes of the condition include: 
Muscle imbalance (strabismus amblyopia). The most common cause of lazy eye is an imbalance in the muscles that position the eyes. This imbalance can cause the eyes to cross in or turn out, and prevents them from working together. 
Difference in sharpness of vision between the eyes (refractive amblyopia). A significant difference between the prescriptions in each eye — often due to farsightedness but sometimes to nearsightedness or an uneven surface curve of the eye (astigmatism) — can result in lazy eye. 
Glasses or contact lenses are typically used to correct these refractive problems. In some children, a lazy eye is caused by a combination of strabismus and refractive problems. 
Deprivation. A problem with one eye — such as a cloudy area in the lens (cataract) — can prohibit clear vision in that eye. Deprivation amblyopia in infancy requires urgent treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. It's often the most severe type of amblyopia. 

RISK FACTORS
Several risk factors contribute to the development of amblyopia/lazy eye include: 
Premature birth 
Small size at birth 
Family history of lazy eye 
Developmental disabilities 
Ptosis 
Strabismus 
Childhood glaucoma 
Early-onset cataracts

SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
Signs and symptoms of lazy eye include: 
An eye that wanders inward or outward 
Eyes that appear to not work together 
Poor depth perception 
Squinting or shutting an eye 
Head tilting 
Abnormal results of vision screening tests 
Sometimes a lazy eye is not evident without an eye exam.  
DIAGNOSIS METHODS
Ophthalmologists diagnose amblyopia by checking to see if vision differs between the two eyes. To check a baby's or young child's vision, the ophthalmologist may cover one of the child's eyes and watch how well they can follow a moving object. The doctor may also watch how the child reacts when one eye is covered. If one eye has amblyopia and the other is covered, the child may try to look above or below the patch, pull it off or cry. 
The ophthalmologist will do a complete medical eye exam, looking for other eye problems that could be affecting vision. 
When Should a Child's Vision Be Tested? 
All children should have their vision checked by their pediatrician or family physician during their routine doctor's appointments. Many children will also have their vision checked at school.  
 If a child's doctor, school, or family is concerned about their vision, the child should see an ophthalmologist for further tests. 
TREATMENT OPTIONS
It's important to start treatment for lazy eye as soon as possible in childhood, when the complicated connections between the eye and the brain are forming. The best results occur when treatment starts before age 7, although half of children between the ages of 7 and 17 respond to treatment. 
Treatment options depend on the cause of the lazy eye and on how much the condition is affecting your child's vision. Your doctor might recommend: 
Corrective eyewear. Glasses or contact lenses can correct problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism that result in lazy eye. 
Eye patches. To stimulate the weaker eye, your child wears an eye patch over the eye with better vision for two to six or more hours a day. In rare cases, wearing an eye patch too long can cause amblyopia to develop in the patched eye. However it's usually reversible. 
Bangerter filter. This special filter is placed on the eyeglass lens of the stronger eye. The filter blurs the stronger eye and, like an eye patch, works to stimulate the weaker eye. 
Eyedrops. An eyedrop of a medication called atropine (Isopto Atropine) can temporarily blur the  vision in the stronger eye. Usually prescribed for use on weekends or daily, use of the drops encourages your child to use the weaker eye, and offers an alternative to a patch. Side effects include sensitivity to light and eye irritation. 
Surgery. Your child might need surgery if he or she has droopy eyelids or cataracts that cause deprivation amblyopia. If your child's eyes continue to cross or wander apart with the appropriate glasses, your doctor might recommend surgical repair to straighten the eyes, in addition to other lazy eye treatments. 
Activity-based treatments — such as drawing, doing puzzles or playing computer games — are available. The effectiveness of adding these activities to other therapies hasn't been proved. Research into new treatments is ongoing. 
For most children with lazy eyes, proper treatment improves vision within weeks to months. Treatment might last from six months to two years. 
It's important for your child to be monitored for recurrence of lazy eye — which can happen in up to 25 percent of children with the condition. If lazy eye recurs, treatment will need to start again. 
 
How to Choose and Use an Eye Patch 
An eye patch should be comfortable yet remain firmly in place. It should also not allow the child to peek around its edges. Most drug stores have a variety of sizes and types of eye patches. Decorated fun patches are available online. Do not use the black eye patches with elastic bands or ties (such as pirate-type patches). These are too easy for a child to remove or peek around. To wear the patch, simply attach it to the skin around your child’s eye. 
If your child wears glasses, there are patches designed to attach to the lens. These may be good for children who are used to wearing a patch, but they are not as good for a child new to treatment. This is because the patch can slip or the child may learn to peek around it. If your child wears glasses and is not used to patching, it is best to attach the patch directly around the stronger eye underneath the glasses. 
Keep Your Child from Taking Off the Eye Patch 
Children do not like to have their stronger eyes patched or blurred. However, you need to help your child do what is best for them. Otherwise, treatment will not work. 
Try distracting the child or having them do something that keeps their attention. Or reward the child with a treat for wearing the patch. 
It can take a while for your child to get used to wearing a patch. Over time, this should get easier for them and you. Remember that strengthening the weaker eye is the only way to develop healthy, normal vision. 
If your child still takes off the patch, as a last resort, you might cover his or her hands with gloves, mittens, or socks. 
Teach Your Child About the Eye Patch 
Pre-school or school-age children might not want to wear an eye patch or use blurring eye drops. To help, parents should explain how important these treatments are to be able to see well. And reassure them that lots of children wear eye patches for the same reason. 
Consider having a very young child practice putting an eye patch on a doll. Or let the child decorate his or her patch with crayons or markers. 
Explain the amblyopia treatment to the child’s teacher. Ask the teacher to compliment the child on being so good about wearing the patch. Children thrive on positive feedback from their teachers. 
Things to consider with patching treatment: 
In very rare instances it is possible to overuse the patch or blurring eye drops. This can affect vision in the stronger eye. Be sure to keep the child’s appointments with the ophthalmologist so that vision in both eyes can be closely monitored. 
The skin near your child’s eye patch can get irritated. To help, try a different size or type of patch, and angle the patch differently each day. 
Your child may initially be clumsy when wearing a patch. Try to keep an eye on your child when they are climbing stairs or being active. 
Treating Amblyopia Using New Technology 
A new treatment for amblyopia uses a virtual reality (VR) headset to help improve vision in children aged 4 to 7. A child watches videos wearing the headset, which helps them use their weaker eye. To learn more, ask your child’s ophthalmologist. 
Treating Amblyopia for Better Lifelong Vision 
When a child has amblyopia, it is important to make vision stronger in the weak eye. Even if eye problems causing amblyopia are corrected with glasses or surgery, the amblyopia itself must be treated. If not, the child may have lifelong vision problems. 
PREVENTION TIPS
Can I prevent my child from developing amblyopia? 
You can’t prevent amblyopia or the other vision issues that cause it. The best thing you can do for your child’s eyes and vision is to have them checked regularly.
OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS 
What can I expect if my child has amblyopia? 
Amblyopia is very treatable if it’s diagnosed early. Children with amblyopia who start treatment early in life are much more likely to have improved vision and fewer long-term effects. 
Your eye care specialist will suggest treatments that improve your child’s sight as much as possible. They might need vision correction lenses like glasses or contact lenses their whole life. 
Can my child grow out of amblyopia? 
No, amblyopia doesn’t go away on its own and children can’t grow out of it. If it’s not treated, amblyopia can cause permanent vision issues, including blindness in the affected eye. 
Living With 
Having your child’s eyes and vision checked regularly can help an eye care specialist identify problems right away. A pediatrician should check your child’s eyes at every well-child visit until they’re old enough to start school, and then every one to two years. 
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
Untreated, lazy eye can cause permanent vision loss 
WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR
See your child's doctor if you notice his or her eye wandering after the first few weeks of life. A vision check is especially important if there's a family history of crossed eyes, childhood cataracts or other eye conditions. 
For all children, a complete eye exam is recommended between ages 3 and 5. 
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 
Amblyopia is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that amblyopia can be diagnosed only after all other potential ocular or cerebral pathologies have been eliminated as the causes of decreased visual acuity. Common factors contributing to decreased visual acuity include refractive errors, cataracts, corneal abnormalities, retinal pathologies, and optic nerve disorders. Most of these pathologies can be ruled out by a comprehensive eye examination. It is also essential to consider the possibility of cerebral visual impairment and functional (non-organic) vision loss. 
While routine diagnostic tests such as OCT, visual field testing, and MRI are not typically conducted in clinical settings, they may be considered in uncertain situations or when there is a need to exclude potential underlying causes of impaired vision.  

Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
Amblyopia presents a significant global health concern owing to its prevalence and the potential for permanent visual impairment if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated. Historically, various forms of amblyopia have been reported to affect up to 3% of the population, with a 1.2% lifetime risk of vision loss attributed to this condition. More recent data suggest that the global prevalence of amblyopia falls within the range of 1.1% to 1.8%. 
Population-based studies have reported varying prevalence rates, with estimates ranging from 0.7% to 2.6% among children aged 30 to 70 months and 1.0% to 5.5% in older children. The reported prevalence of amblyopia can fluctuate based on factors such as age, ethnicity, race, the specific definition used for amblyopia, the methodology of the study, and other contributing variables. 
A comprehensive meta-analysis from global prevalence data encompassing more than 1.8 million patients across 60 studies revealed a pooled prevalence rate of 1.44%, with a range of 1.17% to 1.78%. The prevalence rates varied across different continents, with Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa reporting rates of 2.90%, 2.41%, 1.09%, and 0.72%, respectively. The study estimated that in 2019, approximately 99.2 million people worldwide were affected by amblyopia, with a projected increase to 175 million by the year 2030 and 220 million by 2040. 
Amblyopia typically manifests as a unilateral condition. However, there are instances where patients can develop the bilateral form if both eyes experience visual alterations during early development. Anisometropia is the most common cause of amblyopia, followed by mixed anisometropia and strabismus, strabismus, and visual deprivation. Studies have indicated that the relative prevalence rates, categorized by the type of amblyopia, are approximately 50% due to anisometropia, 19% linked to strabismus, 27% arising from a combination of both factors, and 4% attributed to deprivation-related causes. 
The likelihood of developing amblyopia increases significantly with specific factors. When the difference in refraction error between the eyes falls within the range of 1D to 2D of spherical equivalence, the odds of developing amblyopia are 4.5 times higher. This risk can escalate to a 40-fold increase when the difference in refraction error exceeds 2D. 
Regarding strabismus, amblyopia risk has been reported to be between 3 and 18 times greater compared to individuals without strabismus. Mixed and strabismic amblyopia is typically diagnosed at an earlier age, with an average age of 7.4 years, compared to anisometropic amblyopia, which is usually diagnosed at an average age of 12.7. The prevalence of amblyopia appears to be similar between right and left eyes, and there is no observed gender preference.

ANISOCORIA
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Anisocoria is also referred to as “unequal pupil size” or “pupil asymmetry”
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
Anisocoria is when your eye’s pupils are not the same size. The pupil allows light to enter the eye so that you can see. 
Anyone can have pupils that differ in size with no problems. In fact, 1 out of 5 people have pupils that are normally different sizes. 
Sometimes, though, having uneven pupil size can be a symptom of a serious eye problem. People who may get anisocoria include those with: 
a nervous system problem 
a history of damage to the eye 
risk of having a stroke 
a viral infection 
Adie’s tonic pupil (when one pupil does not respond to light as well as the other pupil) 
Anisocoria is the medical term for one of your pupils being bigger than the other. The pupil is the black center of your eye that changes size to help you see in different amounts of light. It shrinks (contracts) in bright light and expands (dilates) in dim light. 
Your pupils automatically adjust throughout the day without you noticing or controlling them. If you have anisocoria, one will be stuck noticeably larger than the other. You’ll probably be able to see the size difference in a mirror or selfie. 
This might affect your vision. If one pupil can’t adjust to light like it should, you might have trouble seeing clearly, or be sensitive to light in your affected eye. 
Visit an eye care specialist or go to the emergency room if you notice one of your pupils is suddenly larger than the other. Some people develop anisocoria with no long-term complications, but it can also be a sign of a life-threatening medical emergency. If you have other symptoms, like pain or noticeably worse vision, go to your nearest emergency room. 
Types of anisocoria 
Eye care specialists classify anisocoria as either physiological (caused by something malfunctioning inside your body) or pathological (caused by a health condition). Physiological anisocoria is more common. 
This distinction isn’t as important as getting your symptoms evaluated right away. No matter what’s causing your pupils to be irregularly sized, you should see an eye care specialist as soon as possible. 
How common is anisocoria? 
Experts estimate that around 15% of people experience anisocoria at some point in their lives. Some babies are born with it (congenital anisocoria), but it usually happens because of a health condition or another issue that affects your eyes.  
CAUSES 
Anisocoria can be caused by lots of health conditions and injuries, and can be a side effect of some medications. It can also happen without a known cause (idiopathic anisocoria). Some of the most common causes include: 
Migraine headaches. 
Surgery side effects. 
Eye drops, scopolamine skin patches and some other medicines. 
Eye injuries and traumas that affect your head, eyes or the arteries that supply blood to them. 
Some serious, potentially fatal health conditions can cause anisocoria, including: 
Brain aneurysms. 
Strokes. 
Brain tumors. 
Infections like meningitis. 
Certain types of cancer. 
RISK FACTORS
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
What are anisocoria symptoms? 
One pupil being noticeably bigger (more dilated) than the other is the most obvious anisocoria symptom. You might not experience other symptoms. If that’s the case, you still need to visit an eye care specialist to have the change in your eyes diagnosed. 
Go to the emergency room if one pupil is bigger than the other and you experience any of the following: 
Eye pain. 
Blurry vision. 
Double vision (diplopia). 
Light sensitivity (photophobia). 
Sudden vision loss. 
Other symptoms can include: 
Fever. 
Headaches. 
Nausea or vomiting. 
Neck pain or stiffness. 

ANISOCORIA DIAGNOSIS METHOD 
To diagnose anisocoria, your ophthalmologist will examine your pupils in both a lighted room and a dark room. This allows them to see how your pupils respond to light. This can help them figure out which pupil is abnormal. 
Your ophthalmologist will also check your eyes with a slit-lamp microscope. This instrument lets your eye doctor look at your eye in small, detailed sections. That makes it easier to spot problems. 
If you have other symptoms along with different pupil size, your ophthalmologist will do other tests to learn more about your condition. 
An eye care specialist or another healthcare provider will diagnose anisocoria with an eye exam. They’ll perform a physical exam to check for other symptoms. They might give you eye drops to make it easier to examine your eyes. 
Your provider may use imaging tests to look for what’s causing anisocoria, including: 
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). 
CT scan (computed tomography scan). 
X-ray. 
You might also need blood tests or a lumbar puncture if your provider thinks you have an infection. 
ANISOCORIA TREATMENT OPTIONS 
Finding and treating what’s causing the anisocoria is more important than managing the irregularity in your pupils. 
If you have no other symptoms — and your eye care specialist rules out any serious underlying conditions — you probably won’t need any treatment. Your pupils may return to their usual size over time. 
If anisocoria is the first sign of a more serious condition, the treatment you’ll need depends on what’s causing it. Talk to your provider about what you’ll need to do next and what to expect. 
PREVENTION TIPS
How can I prevent anisocoria? 
Because lots of conditions and injuries can cause anisocoria, there’s not one surefire way to prevent it. 
Have your eyes examined regularly and see a healthcare provider every year for a checkup. Regular eye exams and maintaining your overall health are the best ways to catch issues that might cause anisocoria before they damage your eyes and body. 
OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
What can I expect if I have anisocoria? 
Everyone’s outlook is different. It depends on what’s causing the anisocoria. Some issues like migraines or reactions to medications will go away on their own. If you experience something more serious like an aneurysm or stroke, your life might be changed permanently. 
For most people, anisocoria is a minor part of a larger health issue, and as you treat your underlying condition, your pupils will return to their usual size. Ask your healthcare provider or eye care specialist about your unique outlook. 
Living With 
When should I see my healthcare provider? 
Visit an eye care specialist as soon as you notice any changes in your eyes or vision. 
Go to the emergency room right away if your pupils are different sizes and you have sudden, new pain or vision loss. 

Possible complications
When to see a doctor / red flag
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 
The differential of conditions causing anisocoria may be divided into three sub-categories, depending upon whether the anisocoria increases in dim light, in bright light, or remains equal in both lighting conditions. 
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
The prevalence of physiologic anisocoria is generally considered to be around 10 to 20%, which does not seem to differ greatly around the world. Physiologic anisocoria does not seem to have a sex predilection nor occurs at a specific age. Physiologic anisocoria is probably the most common cause. The prevalence of other causes of anisocoria is associated with the prevalence of the underlying condition. 
ANIRIDIA

ALTERNATIVE NAMES:
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
If your child has aniridia, their pupils will look larger than usual
Aniridia is a condition that causes babies to be born without irises (the colored part of your eye). Some babies are missing their entire irises. Others only have part of an iris in each eye.
Aniridia always affects both of your child’s eyes (it’s a bilateral condition).
A healthcare provider will probably diagnose aniridia when your child is born. They’ll be able to see the missing iris in your child’s eyes. No matter how much of your baby’s irises are missing, aniridia will affect their vision and can eventually lead to other issues in their eyes later in life.
CAUSES OF ANIRIDIA
What causes aniridia?
Aniridia is a genetic disorder. It happens when a genetic change affects the PAX6 gene. This gene helps form your baby’s eyes and parts of their brain, spinal cord and pancreas. The genetic change that causes aniridia usually happens between the 12th and 14th week of pregnancy.
Risk factors
Aniridia is more common in children whose biological parents have it. If one parent has aniridia, there’s a 50/50 chance their biological child will, too.
So, if you have aniridia, that doesn’t guarantee that your biological children will have it. It just means they’re more likely to.
Aniridia can also happen on its own (sporadically) even if neither biological parent has it. This happens in around 1 in 3 cases.
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
Symptoms of aniridia
Because your child is missing their irises, their pupils will look larger than usual. Their pupils might be unevenly shaped. They’ll have a hard time adjusting to changes in lighting. This can lead to symptoms like:
Blindness or partial vision loss in one or both eyes
Blurry vision
Eye pain
Low vision
Light sensitivity (photophobia)
DIAGNOSIS METHODS 
How is aniridia diagnosed?
Your provider will diagnose aniridia when your baby is born. You should be able to see the missing irises in your baby’s eyes.
If you’re pregnant and concerned about the fetus’s risk of aniridia (or other genetic disorders), talk to your provider about prenatal genetic testing. Your provider will use a blood test to tell how likely it is that the fetus could have a genetic disorder. They might also perform amniocentesis — removing and testing a small amount of your amniotic fluid.
TREATMENT OPTIONS
Management and Treatment
Treating aniridia focuses on maintaining or improving your child’s vision.
Your child will need regular eye exams and visits with an eye care specialist. The sooner your provider diagnoses changes in your child’s eyes, the more likely they’ll be able to prevent symptoms or complications.
Your child might need a few treatments, including:
Glasses or contact lenses. Just like anyone with vision issues, wearing glasses or contact lenses can improve your child’s vision. Kids with aniridia sometimes wear specialized colored contacts that mimic the shape of an iris to cover their pupils and reduce light sensitivity.
Medications. If your child develops glaucoma or cornea issues, your provider might prescribe medicated eye drops, artificial tears or other medications.
Surgery. Children who develop cataracts may need cataract surgery to remove them. Your child might also need glaucoma surgery. They might be able to get implanted artificial irises. This is a relatively new treatment, so not every child is a good candidate for this type of surgery.
Prevention tips
Prognosis
OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
What can I expect if my child has aniridia?
You should expect your child to have vision issues. Your child will need regular eye exams throughout their life to monitor their eye health.
More than 8 in 10 children with aniridia have poor or impaired eyesight. Most people with aniridia develop glaucoma, usually when they’re 10 to 20 years old.
But this doesn’t mean every baby born with aniridia will definitely face these issues. Talk to your provider or eye care specialist about what to expect as your child gets older.
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
Complications of this condition
Other parts of your child’s eyes might be underdeveloped, as well, including their optic nerves and retinas.
Children with aniridia are likely to develop other eye issues as they grow up, including:
Cataracts
Cloudy corneas
Glaucoma
Nystagmus
Children with sporadic aniridia have a higher risk of developing a Wilms tumor (a rare type of kidney cancer). The genetic change that causes sporadic aniridia is much more likely to impact other parts of your child’s body that the PAX6 gene is responsible for.
WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR / RED FLAG
When should I see my healthcare provider?
See a healthcare provider as soon as you notice any changes in your child’s eyes or vision. You might want to ask your provider questions like:
How often will my child need eye exams?
Is my child a good candidate for artificial iris surgery?
What are the chances my child experiences complications?
Which changes or symptoms should I look out for?
Go to the emergency room if your child has any of the following symptoms:
A sudden loss of vision
Severe eye pain
Seeing new flashes or floaters in their eyes

ANOPHTHALMIA AND MICROPHTHALMIA
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: 
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
Microphthalmia and anophthalmia
Microphthalmia and anophthalmia are both congenital conditions that affect the eyes. A congenital condition is one that you have when you’re born. Conditions that are a result of problems with fetal development are sometimes called birth defects. You may hear some people say that anophthalmia and microphthalmia are examples of “eye birth defects.”
Microphthalmia means that one eye or both eyes don’t develop fully so they are small and disorganized. Bilateral microphthalmia is the term for when the condition affects both eyes. Unilateral microphthalmia is the term for when the condition affects only one eye.
Other names for microphthalmia include small eye syndrome and microphthalmos.
Anophthalmia means that one or both eyes don’t develop at all so they are missing. In bilateral anophthalmia, both eyes are missing. In unilateral anophthalmia, one eye is missing.
According to some estimates, these conditions (anophthalmia and microphthalmia) affect about 1 in 5,200 to 1 in 10,000 infants born each year in the U.S.
CAUSES
What causes microphthalmia and anophthalmia?
Researchers don’t know for sure what causes anophthalmia or what causes microphthalmia. Some babies are born with these conditions due to genetic changes. Researchers think that the changes in genes and chromosomes may combine with environmental factors to result in conditions present at birth.
There are other things that may be factors in these eye conditions, including:
Taking medications that include isotretinoin (Accutane®) or thalidomide during a pregnancy. Isotretinoin treats acne. Thalidomide treats cancer and some skin conditions.
Being exposed to X-rays or other forms of radiation during pregnancy.
Being exposed to chemicals, like drugs or pesticides, during pregnancy.
Being exposed to infections like rubella and toxoplasmosis during pregnancy.
Maternal vitamin A deficiency.
and risk factors
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
What are the symptoms of microphthalmia and anophthalmia?
Your provider will be able to tell if your baby has microphthalmia or anophthalmia by looking carefully during a physical examination and doing an eye exam.
Symptoms include poor vision or even complete vision loss. These eye conditions can happen along with other eye conditions and medical issues.
Some of the other eye issues include:
Cataracts: A cataract forms on the lens of the eye and makes it cloudy, causing poor vision and subdued colors.
Coloboma: A coloboma means that tissue is missing in the eye. It mostly happens in the iris, or the colored part of the eye. If you have a coloboma, your pupil (the black part of the eye) may have an irregular shape because the iris has a notch or groove in it.
Microcornea: A microcornea is a cornea that’s very small. If you have it, your cornea doesn’t reach 10 mm in diameter even when you’re an adult.
Detached retina: This condition is serious and can cause blindness. The retina, a layer of tissue at the back of your eye, gets separated from its supporting tissue. The retina is responsible for sending signals to the brain so we can see.
Ptosis or pseudoptosis: Ptosis refers to a drooping eyelid and involves muscles and nerves. Pseudoptosis may look like ptosis because the eyelid droops. However, the cause isn’t nerves and muscles, but an undeveloped ocular globe (eyeball).
DIAGNOSIS METHODS
How do providers diagnose these conditions?
In a newborn child, your provider can diagnose anophthalmia and microphthalmia through an examination. However, it’s also possible to diagnose these conditions during pregnancy.
Tests that can diagnose microphthalmia and anophthalmia before birth include:
Ultrasound. Ultrasonography uses high-intensity sound waves to generate images. Fetal ultrasound can’t always detect microphthalmia.
Fetal MRI. MRI stands for magnetic resonance imaging. It’s a specialized imaging test that may be helpful in evaluating for fetal congenital anomalies and associated complications.
Genetic testing, like the quad marker screening test: The quad screen is a blood test done between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy that can provide information on genetic disorders in the fetus.

TREATMENT OPTIONS
Management and Treatment
What medications or treatments are used for microphthalmia and anophthalmia?
Healthcare providers aren’t able to provide a new eye for people born with these conditions. However, there are treatments that include:
Conformers: These are devices that fit into the eye socket to help your eye socket and face develop more typically. You’ll need bigger devices as your face grows.
Prosthetic eyes: Prosthetic eyes are placed in empty eye sockets. They also help with socket and face development and can help with cosmetic concerns.
Surgery: You might need surgery to treat cataracts, coloboma or to help with the conformer fittings.
Services to help a child and their family deal with vision loss or blindness. Some of these specialists include teachers for the visually impaired, low vision therapists and low vision specialists. These early intervention services will help babies learn to walk, talk and interact with others. Additional services can help families work together to improve life for their child.
Glasses or contacts. Correcting refractive error is necessary to treat any sign of amblyopia, also called lazy eye. Protective eyewear is important if you only have one eye with vision. Depending on which parts of the eye are involved in microphthalmia, you may still be able to have the ability to see clearly, especially with corrective lenses.
PREVENTION TIPS
There’s no way to completely eliminate your risk of microphthalmia and anophthalmia, but there are ways to make pregnancy safer:
See a healthcare provider before you get pregnant and work together so you can be as healthy as possible before and during your pregnancy. This talk should include details on what types of vaccinations you might need to be up-to-date before you get pregnant.
Make sure you get prenatal care (care before birth) early and consistently. Always go to your appointments, even if you feel fine.
Talk to your provider about the medications and over-the-counter products you take to make sure that they are compatible with a healthy pregnancy. This includes prescription products and supplements. You must talk to your provider if you take isotretinoin and thalidomide.
Your provider may suggest genetic testing before you get pregnant after discussing your medical history and your family history.
Avoid harmful chemicals.
OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
What can I expect if I have microphthalmia or anophthalmia?
There’s no cure for microphthalmia or anophthalmia. It’s a question of managing these conditions and any other conditions that might occur with them.
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider?
It’s important to have a healthcare team if you or your child has microphthalmia or anophthalmia. In addition to a pediatrician or internist, someone with either of these conditions will probably need an ophthalmologist, an ocularist and an oculoplastic surgeon.
An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who is trained in diagnosing and treating eye conditions and vision conditions.
An ocularist is a provider who can make prosthetic devices like artificial eyes and conformers. They can also do the fitting for these devices.
An oculoplastic surgeon is a surgeon who has special training with the eyes, the eye sockets and the bones that make them up.
It’s a good idea to have all these members of your healthcare team (or your child’s team), along with experts who can help with any other areas of need

BEHçET DISEASE
ALTERNATIVE NAMES:
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
Behcet (beh-CHET) disease, also called Behcet syndrome, is a rare condition. It causes blood vessel swelling, called inflammation, throughout the body.
Behcet disease symptoms can seem like they aren't related at first. They can include mouth sores, eye irritation and swelling, skin rashes and sores, and genital sores.
Treatment involves medicines to ease symptoms of Behcet disease and to prevent serious complications, such as blindness.
CAUSES
Behcet disease might be an autoimmune disorder, which means the body's immune system attacks some of its own healthy cells by mistake. It's likely that gene changes and factors in the environment play a role.
Experts believe that swelling of the blood vessels, called vasculitis, causes the symptoms of Behcet disease. The condition can involve arteries and veins of all sizes. Vasculitis can damage blood vessels all through the body.
Some genes might make people more likely to get Behcet disease. Some researchers think that a germ can trigger the disease in people who have these genes.
RISK FACTORS
Factors that might increase your risk of Behcet disease include:
Age. Behcet disease most often affects people in their 20s and 30s. But children and older adults also can have the condition.
Country. People from countries in the Middle East and East Asia, including Turkey, Iran, Japan and China, are more likely to get Behcet disease.
Sex assigned at birth. Behcet disease can happen to anyone. But the disease is most often worse in people assigned male at birth.
Genes. Certain genes may be linked with a higher risk of getting Behcet disease.
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
Behcet disease symptoms vary from person to person. Symptoms can come and go or become less serious over time. Symptoms depend on which parts of the body the condition affects.
Behcet disease most often affects the following:
Mouth. Painful mouth sores that look like canker sores are the most common sign of Behcet disease. They begin as raised, round sores in the mouth. They quickly turn into painful ulcers.
The sores most often heal in 1 to 3 weeks. But they often come back.
Skin. Some people get sores that look like acne on their bodies. Others get raised and tender growths called nodules on their skin, mainly on the lower legs.
Genitals. Open sores can happen on the scrotum or the vulva. The sores are most often painful and can leave scars.
Eyes. Irritation and swelling, called inflammation, in the eye causes redness, pain and blurred vision. Called uveitis, this inflammation most often affects both eyes. In people with Behcet disease, these symptoms can come and go.
Joints. Joint swelling and pain often affect the knees in people with Behcet disease. The ankles, elbows or wrists also might be involved. Symptoms can last 1 to 3 weeks and go away on their own.
Blood vessels. Swelling, called inflammation, in veins and arteries can cause redness and pain. It can cause a blood clot, which leads to swelling in the arms or legs. Inflammation in the large arteries can lead to complications. These include bulges in the artery that can burst, called aneurysms, and narrowed or blocked blood vessels.
Digestive system. Several symptoms can affect the network of organs that digest food, called the digestive system. Symptoms may include belly pain, diarrhea and bleeding.
Brain. Swelling, called inflammation, in the brain and nervous system can cause headache, fever, confusion, poor balance or stroke.
DIAGNOSIS METHODS
No tests can show that you have Behcet disease. So your healthcare professional mainly makes the diagnosis based on your symptoms. Nearly everyone with the condition gets mouth sores. So mouth sores that come back at least three times in 12 months often are needed for a diagnosis of Behcet disease.
Also, a diagnosis of Behcet disease needs at least two other symptoms, such as:
Genital sores that keep coming back.
Swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the eye.
Skin sores.
Tests to help diagnose Behcet disease include:
Lab tests. Blood tests or other lab tests might rule out other conditions.
Pathergy test. Your healthcare professional puts a sterile needle into your skin and looks at the area 1 to 2 days later. If the test is positive, a small bump forms under your skin where the needle was put in. This shows that your immune system reacts too much to a minor injury.
TREATMENT OPTIONS
There's no cure for Behcet disease. If you have a mild form, your healthcare professional might suggest medicines to manage the pain and swelling of flares. You might not need medicine between flares. For some people, symptoms get better over time.
For worse symptoms, you might take medicines to manage Behcet disease throughout your body. Plus you might take medicines for flares.
Treatments for symptoms of Behcet disease
Medicines to manage symptoms during flares might include:
Skin creams, gels and ointments. These products, called topical medicines, are corticosteroid medicines that you put on skin and genital sores.
Mouth rinses. Special mouthwashes that have corticosteroids and other agents might reduce the pain of mouth sores.
Eye drops. For mild swelling and irritation, eye drops that have corticosteroids or other medicines might help.
Whole-body treatments for Behcet disease
If topical medicines don't help, you might take a medicine by mouth called colchicine (Colcrys, Mitigare, others). This is for mouth and genital sores that come back. Colchicine also might ease joint swelling.
More recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved apremilast (Otezla) for the treatment of mouth sores caused by Behcet disease. Side effects may include weight loss and depression.
If you have more-serious Behcet disease, you may need treatments to lessen damage from the disease between flares. Your healthcare professional might prescribe:
Corticosteroids to manage swelling and irritation, called inflammation. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone (Rayos), ease the inflammation caused by Behcet disease. Healthcare professionals often prescribe corticosteroids with another medicine to make the immune system less active.
Side effects of corticosteroids include weight gain, heartburn, high blood pressure and bone thinning, called osteoporosis.
Medicines that make the immune system less active. Medicines that keep the immune system from attacking healthy tissues include azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, others) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan).
These medicines can increase the risk of infection. They also can affect the liver and kidneys and cause low blood counts and high blood pressure.
Medicines that change how the immune system responds. Interferon alfa-2b (Intron A) may be used alone or with other medicines to help manage skin sores, joint pain and eye irritation in people with Behcet disease. Side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as muscle pain and fatigue.
Medicines that block a substance called tumor necrosis factor can treat some of the symptoms of Behcet disease. People who have worse symptoms or symptoms that resist treatment might take one of these medicines.
Medicines include infliximab (Remicade) and adalimumab (Humira). Side effects might include headache, skin rash and a higher risk of infections.

Prognosis

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
Complications of Behcet disease depend on symptoms. For instance, untreated uveitis can lead to loss of vision or blindness. If you have eye symptoms of Behcet disease, see an eye specialist, called an ophthalmologist, regularly. Treatment can help prevent this complication.
WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR
Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have symptoms that might be Behcet disease. If you've been diagnosed with the condition, see your health professional if you get new symptoms.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Neurologic Behçet disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a variety of neurologic syndromes, including the following:
Stroke in young adults
Multiple sclerosis
Movement disorders
Intracranial hypertension
Intracranial sinovenous occlusive diseases
Ophthalmologic considerations
It is important to consider other forms of uveitis in the differential diagnosis, especially in those patients who have a mild or atypical presentation of Behçet disease.
Human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27)–related anterior uveitis also may cause recurrent iridocyclitis with hypopyon, but it is typically unilateral.
Since Behçet disease is a bilateral panuveitis, other inflammatory processes that affect both eyes must be considered. Syphilis causes retinitis with vitritis rather than strict vasculitis. The diagnosis for syphilis is confirmed by serology.
Sarcoidosis, another bilateral inflammatory process, may produce posterior pole findings similar to
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
United States statistics
Behçet disease is not common in the United States. The US prevalence is reported as 0.12-0.33 cases per 100,000 population.  However, data from a study of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, over a 45-year period identified a prevalence of 5.2 cases per 100,000 population. 
The American Southwest has a prevalence of 8.9-10.6 cases per 100,000 population, with ethnic proportions of 49.2% Hispanic American, 31.7% European-American, 14.3% Native American, and 1.7% derived from Silk Road populations. 
International statistics
Worldwide, the incidence and prevalence of Behçet disease are highest along the Silk Road, the ancient trade passage that extended from China to the Middle East and southern Europe. This geographic pattern correlates with the prevalence of carriage of the HLA-B*51 allele of the major histocompatibility complex, which is associated with susceptibility to Behçet disease.  A meta-analysis of 18 HLA-B*51 studies concluded that this association with Behçet disease appeared to strengthen geographically eastward along the Silk Road. 
Turkey has the highest prevalence of Behçet disease, with 420 cases per 100,000 population. The prevalence in Japan, Korea, China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia ranges from 13.5 to 22 cases per 100,000 population. The prevalence in North America and Europe is much lower, with 1 case per 15,000-500,000 population.

BELL’S PALSY
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Bell’s palsy is also known as “acute facial palsy of unknown cause”, or simply “facial palsy”.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
Bell’s palsy is a nerve problem that affects the muscles of your face. It causes weakness or partial paralysis of the muscles on one side of your face. With Bell’s palsy, your eyelid may not close properly and your smile may seem uneven. 
Bell’s palsy usually affects adults only. It is more likely to happen to people who have diabetes, are pregnant, or have a family history of Bell’s palsy. 
CAUSES
What Causes Bell's Palsy?
Generally, it is not known what causes Bell’s palsy. However, doctors believe it may be due to one or more of these problems: 
problems in your body’s immune system (how it fights disease) 
reduced blood flow to a nerve that goes to your face (the 7th cranial nerve) 
infection from a virus, causing swelling of the facial nerves 

Although the exact reason Bell's palsy occurs isn't clear, it's often related to having a viral infection. Viruses that have been linked to Bell's palsy include viruses that cause: 
Cold sores and genital herpes, also known as herpes simplex. 
Chickenpox and shingles, also known as herpes zoster. 
Infectious mononucleosis, caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. 
Cytomegalovirus infections. 
Respiratory illnesses, caused by adenoviruses. 
German measles, also known as rubella. 
Mumps, caused by the mumps virus. 
Flu, also known as influenza B. 
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease, caused by a coxsackievirus. 
The nerve that controls facial muscles passes through a narrow corridor of bone on its way to the face. In Bell's palsy, that nerve becomes inflamed and swollen — usually related to a viral infection. Besides affecting facial muscles, the nerve affects tears, saliva, taste and a small bone in the middle of the ear. 
RISK FACTORS
Bell's palsy occurs more often in people who: 
Are pregnant, especially during the third trimester, or who are in the first week after giving birth. 
Have an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold. 
Have diabetes. 
Have high blood pressure. 
Have obesity. 
It's rare for Bell's palsy to come back. But when it does, there's often a family history of repeated attacks. This suggests that Bell's palsy might have something to do with genes. 
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
What Are Symptoms of Bell's Palsy? 
Symptoms of Bell's palsy come on suddenly and may include: 
Mild weakness to total paralysis on one side of the face — occurring within hours to days. 
Facial droop and trouble making facial expressions, such as closing an eye or smiling. 
Drooling. 
Pain around the jaw or pain in or behind the ear on the affected side. 
Increased sensitivity to sound on the affected side. 
Headache. 
Loss of taste. 
Changes in the amount of tears and saliva produced. 
Rarely, Bell's palsy can affect the nerves on both sides of the face. 
Your eyes may become dry and you may have blurry vision. One eye may not close completely, and it may feel irritated. 
You might not be able to taste food as well as you could before. Also, you could have hearing problems, such as having things sound distorted or unusual. 
Tell your primary care doctor or ophthalmologist if any of your symptoms get worse. 
If you have symptoms on both sides of your face, you may have something other than Bell’s palsy. If your symptoms do not improve in a few weeks, your ophthalmologist may recommend an MRI. An MRI is a scan that provides images of tissue inside the body. 
How long do Bell’s palsy symptoms last? 
For about 8 out of 10 people, symptoms of Bell’s palsy start to improve in about 3 weeks. Symptoms should be nearly gone in about 2 to 3 months. 
Some symptoms may remain, such as a small amount of facial paralysis or reduced movement on one side of your face. For about 2 out of 10 people, Bell’s palsy symptoms never go away. 
Your ophthalmologist can tell you how to relieve uncomfortable eye-related symptoms from Bell’s palsy. 
DIAGNOSIS METHOD
There's no specific test for Bell's palsy. Your healthcare professional looks at your face and asks you to move your facial muscles. You're asked to close your eyes, lift your brow, show your teeth and frown, among making other movements. 
Other conditions — such as a stroke, infections, Lyme disease, inflammatory conditions and tumors — can cause facial muscle weakness that mimics Bell's palsy. If the cause of your symptoms isn't clear, your healthcare professional may recommend other tests, including: 
Electromyography (EMG). This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine how serious it is. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation. It also measures the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve. 
Imaging scans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) may be needed on occasion to rule out other possible sources of pressure on the facial nerve, such as a tumor or skull fracture. 
Blood tests. There is no blood test for Bell's palsy. But blood tests can be used to rule out Lyme disease and other infections. 

TREATMENT OPTIONS
How Is Bell's Palsy Treated? 
There is no main treatment for Bell’s palsy. In most cases, it goes away on its own in a few weeks. However, your ophthalmologist can help manage the symptoms affecting your eye. Eye drops or other lubricants provide relief if you cannot fully shut your eye. 
In some cases, corticosteroids, antiviral drugs or other medicine may be prescribed to help you heal from Bell’s palsy 
Most people with Bell's palsy recover fully — with or without treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all treatment for Bell's palsy. But your healthcare professional may suggest medicines or physical therapy to help speed your recovery. Surgery is rarely an option for Bell's palsy. 
Because the eye on the affected side doesn't close, it's important to take steps to protect and care for that eye. Use lubricating eye drops during the day and an eye ointment at night to help keep your eye moist. Wear glasses or goggles during the day and an eye patch at night to protect your eye from getting poked or scratched. You may need to see a healthcare professional to monitor your eye. 
MEDICINES
Commonly used medicines to treat Bell's palsy include: 
Corticosteroids, such as prednisone (Rayos, Prednisone Intensol). These are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, the nerve can fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when symptoms start. Steroids started early improve the likelihood of complete recovery. 
Antiviral drugs. The role of antivirals is not certain. Antivirals alone have shown no benefit compared with placebo. Antivirals added to steroids may benefit some people with Bell's palsy, but this is still not proved. 
Despite this, an antiviral medicine, such as valacyclovir (Valtrex) or acyclovir, is sometimes given in combination with prednisone in people with severe facial palsy. 
Physical therapy 
Paralyzed muscles can shrink and shorten, which may be permanent. A physical therapist can teach you how to massage and exercise your facial muscles to help prevent this from occurring. 
Surgery 
In the past, decompression surgery was used to relieve the pressure on the facial nerve by opening the bony passage that the nerve passes through. Today, decompression surgery isn't recommended. Facial nerve injury and permanent hearing loss are possible risks associated with this surgery. 
Rarely, plastic surgery may be needed to correct lasting facial nerve problems. Facial reanimation surgery helps make the face look more even and may restore facial movement. Examples of this type of surgery include an eyebrow lift, an eyelid lift, facial implants and nerve grafts. Some procedures, such as an eyebrow lift, may need to be repeated after several years. 

Prevention tips
Prognosis
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
Mild symptoms of Bell's palsy typically disappear within a month. Recovery from more-complete facial paralysis can vary. Complications may include: 
Irreversible damage to your facial nerve. 
Irregular regrowth of nerve fibers. This may result in involuntary contraction of certain muscles when you're trying to move other muscles, known as synkinesis. For example, when you smile, the eye on the affected side may close. 
Partial or complete blindness of the eye that won't close. This is caused by excessive dryness and scratching of the clear protective covering of the eye, known as the cornea. 
WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR
Seek medical help right away if you experience any type of paralysis because you may be having a stroke. Bell's palsy is not caused by a stroke, but the symptoms of both conditions are similar. 
If you have facial weakness or drooping, see your healthcare professional to find out the cause and the severity of the illness. 
Lifestyle and home remedies 
Home treatment may include: 
Taking pain relievers. Aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) are available without a prescription and may help ease your pain. 
Doing physical therapy exercises. Massaging and exercising your face according to your physical therapist's advice may help relax your facial muscles. 
  
Alternative medicine 
Although there's little scientific evidence to support the use of alternative medicine to treat Bell's palsy, some people with the condition may benefit from the following: 
Acupuncture. Placing thin needles into a specific point in the skin helps stimulate nerves and muscles, which may offer some relief. 
Biofeedback training. By teaching you to use your thoughts to control your body, biofeedback training may help you gain better control over your facial muscles. 
OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). This medicine may help manage symptoms such as facial spasms and tearing. Injections of onabotulinumtoxinA also may help improve the balance of the face 
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis for acute hemifacial palsy is broad and includes infectious, neoplastic, vascular, traumatic, toxic, and metabolic etiologies. In most cases, however, a patient presenting with rapid-onset, hemifacial weakness without other neurological or dermatological signs or symptoms and without a history of trauma, chemical exposure, or severe metabolic derangement will be experiencing Bell palsy. 
The most common condition that may be mistaken for Bell palsy is Ramsay Hunt syndrome, particularly when it presents as zoster sine herpete, ie, hemifacial palsy without a rash but still with significant pain. Lyme disease is another fairly common cause of acute facial paralysis, although it can usually be identified by the pathognomonic targetoid rash, a history of tick bite or travel to an endemic area, and potentially bilateral facial weakness. Other viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus, may also present with unilateral facial paralysis but often also cause vague systemic symptoms, such as fevers, fatigue, and malaise. Tuberculosis and COVID may also cause facial paralysis, but typically with accompanying respiratory symptoms. Neoplasms, such as facial nerve schwannoma and parotid gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma, as well as autoimmune disorders, such as Sjögren syndrome, are more likely to cause an insidious onset of facial paralysis but may nevertheless present acutely. 
Cerebrovascular accidents are often considered high on the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with Bell palsy, leading to unnecessary imaging. A patient with acute onset hemifacial weakness in the absence of other neurological symptoms or vital sign instability is unlikely to be experiencing cerebral ischemia, particularly if the forehead is paralyzed. A brainstem stroke, unlike a cortical stroke, will cause hemifacial weakness that includes the forehead but will typically also cause other cranial neuropathies as well as vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. Recurrent episodes of hemifacial paralysis may represent Bell palsy, which recurs in 8% to 12% of affected patients. Still, patients with more than 2 episodes without other risk factors should be evaluated further with imaging and laboratory studies, as facial nerve schwannomas and autoimmune diseases, such as Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, may present this way. 
Sometimes, risk factors may not be apparent, even with a detailed history and physical examination. For example, a patient may deny a history of head trauma but fail to mention self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) diving or air travel, either of which can result in otic barotrauma and subsequent facial paralysis. Similarly, a patient with a distant cancer may suffer facial paralysis as a result of brain metastasis or chemotherapy. Misadventures with botulinum toxin injections can cause facial paralysis as well, which some patients may be reluctant to disclose. Last, otologic disease should not be overlooked, whether in the context of acute otitis media or a chronic cholesteatoma. 

Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
The annual incidence of Bell palsy is 15 to 40 per 100,000 individuals, and the lifetime risk is 1 in 60, with a recurrence rate of 8% to 12%. There is no sex, ethnic, or laterality predilection, and Bell palsy can occur at any age; there is a bimodal distribution with incidence peaks between 20 and 30 years and between 60 and 70. There are multiple known risk factors for developing Bell palsy, including diabetes, pregnancy, preeclampsia, obesity, dental procedures, and, debatably, hypertension. Pregnant patients and those with diabetes are specifically at higher risk for worse outcomes and are potentially more likely to present with worse paralysis than patients without diabetes and who aren't pregnant with Bell palsy. 
According to a 2022 paper published by Escalante et al, the most common severity of Bell palsy is House-Brackmann grade III (mild-moderate), accounting for 41.9% of patients. Grade VI palsy (total hemifacial paralysis) occurs in 20.1% of patients. House-Brackmann grades II (mild) and V (severe) each comprise 16.3% of patients, and grade IV accounts for only 5.4%. The same study also assessed the chance of recovery as a function of palsy severity and found that patients with House-Brackmann grade VI palsy had a 60% chance of recovery to grade I or II, and grade V patients had an 83% chance if provided steroids and antivirals. Patients with grade II to IV paralysis all recovered to grade I or II in this series.

BEST DISEASE (BEST VITELLIFORM MACULAR DYSTROPHY)
ALTERNATIVE NAMES:
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
What is Best disease?
Best disease is an inherited disease that affects the retinas of your eyes. It causes the macula, which is the central part of the retina, to degrade. This means that you can have problems with your central vision, or seeing things that are right in front of you. Best disease may not affect peripheral (side) vision.
Other names for Best disease include vitelliform macular dystrophy or vitelliform dystrophy. Dystrophy is the medical name for the degeneration of an organ.
There’s a form of vitelliform macular dystrophy that doesn’t start when you’re young but instead happens when you get older, usually from 40 to 60 years of age. This is the adult-onset type of the disease.
How common is Best disease?
It’s not clear how many people actually inherit Best disease. One study indicates that Best disease happens in an estimated 1 in 16,500 to 1 in 21,000 people. Another estimate puts the figure at about 1 in 15,000 people and yet another puts the figure at 1 in 10,000 people.
What are the stages of Best disease?
Best disease can go through six stages. They are:
Stage I - Pre Vitelliform: You probably don’t have symptoms. You haven’t yet developed any of the yellow material underneath your retina.
Stage II - Vitelliform: This word (vitelliform) means “shaped like an egg.” At this stage, the yellow material is collected in an egg-like shape. Your vision may still be fine.
Stage III - Pseudohypopyon: The yellow material may develop into a cyst under the retina.
Stage IV - Vitelliruptive: The material may begin to damage the cells of the retina and you may notice changes in vision.
Stage V- Atrophic: The yellow material goes away, but it leaves scars and damaged cells. Some researchers consider this to be the final stage of Best disease.
Stage VI - Choroidal neovascularization or CNV: Some researchers consider CNV to be the final stage of Best disease, while others think that CNV is a complication of the disease. CNV happens in about 20% of people who have Best disease. Neovascularization refers to new blood vessels that grow in the choroid. The choroid is the layer of tissue between the retina and the sclera (the white part of your eye). Those blood vessels may leak and cause your vision to get worse.
CAUSES
What causes Best disease?
A genetic condition causes Best disease.
Best disease is an autosomal dominant condition. This means that only one parent needs to have an altered gene to pass it on. It also means that half of the children of a parent with an autosomal trait will get that particular trait. In this case, the trait is Best disease.
The gene that’s affected in Best disease is the gene that can be affected in some types of retinitis pigmentosa, a group of inherited eye diseases.
and risk factors
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
What are the symptoms of Best disease?
You’ll probably find out about Best disease after an eye exam. Sometimes there are no signs and symptoms. When there are, signs and symptoms may include:
Blurred vision.
Problems with central vision but not with side vision.
Seeing things that appear to be shaped oddly, like wavy lines instead of straight lines. This is called metamorphopsia.
Severe vision loss.
Different levels of vision or vision loss in each eye.
DIAGNOSIS METHODS
How is Best disease diagnosed?
In many cases, a healthcare provider will find Best disease when you’re between five and 10 years old or by the time you’re 20 years old.
An eye care specialist will first take a medical history and do an eye exam. They may also ask for imaging tests and measure how thick your choroid is. Tests may include:
Fluorescein angiography: This is an imaging test that uses dye to show blood vessels.
Optical coherence tomography: This type of noninvasive imaging test uses reflected light to create pictures of the back of your eye.
Color fundus photography: This type of imaging shows your retina, the related blood vessels and the optic nerve head.
Ophthalmic electrophysiology: This term describes a series of eye tests that measure electrical activity.
Genetic tests: These tests will give the provider information about your genes.
The eye care provider may also want to speak to family members or examine their eyes.
TREATMENT OPTIONS
Management and Treatment
How is Best disease treated?
There’s no cure for Best disease at this time.
Managing Best disease depends on the symptoms and stage of the condition. Once it’s diagnosed, you’ll need to keep a regular schedule of eye appointments so any changes can be found early.
In early stages, you might not need any treatment. You may need treatment for other conditions, such as corrective lenses for refractive errors. People with Best disease often have farsightedness. If you have cataracts, you may need cataract surgery.
If you have choroid neovascularization and you’ve developed a choroid neovascularization membrane, the provider may suggest the following to stop the growth of new blood vessels:
Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents: These are medications injected into the vitreous cavity of your eye. They’re intended to stop new blood vessels from growing.
Laser therapy: This treatment uses lasers to close off the blood vessels.
Photodynamic therapy: This treatment combines a laser and a drug that’s activated by light to damage the blood vessels and stop leaking.
Your provider may also suggest you use low vision aids like magnifying devices and other helpful tools.
Researchers are working on treatments or preventatives that use genetic material. Gene therapy is experimental.
Prevention tips
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of developing Best disease?
You can’t stop yourself from developing Best disease. If you have the genetic background to pass on Best disease, you may be interested in genetic counseling.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have Best disease?
Best disease isn’t fatal, but it’s not curable, either. You won’t go blind from Best disease, but you may have low vision.
Living With
How do I take care of myself?
Certain types of foods may help with eye health. Consider eating fish a few times per week and consuming leafy green vegetables along with other types of fruits and vegetables and nuts.
If you have Best disease, you should have regular healthcare appointments, including regular eye care appointments. Let the care provider know about any changes in your vision or your health. You may want to ask questions like:
Can you recommend a genetic counselor to help me decide about having children?
Am I eligible to participate in a clinical trial?
Can you recommend an optometrist that specializes in low vision?
Is gene therapy an option for treatment?

Mortality/Morbidity
Visual acuity is good in the previtelliform stage. Even with the egg-yolk appearance, visual acuity is maintained in the range of 20/20 to 20/50 (6/6 to 6/15) for many years. The breakup of the vitelliform stage, leading to the scrambled egg stage, may be accompanied by visual acuity deterioration. It is the final stages of geographic RPE atrophy with possible development of choroidal neovascular membrane that is associated with further deterioration in visual acuity. [6, 7] These changes usually occur in individuals older than 40 years. Various studies have shown that most individuals retain reading and driving vision in at least 1 eye into adulthood (88% have 20/40 or better vision). Only 4% of these individuals develop vision less than 20/200 in the better eye.
Race
Best disease is most common in individuals of European ancestry but can also be found in individuals of African and Hispanic ancestry.
Sex
No known gender predilection exists.
Age
Usual onset of Best disease is from 3-15 years, with an average age of 6 years. The condition often is not detected until much later in the disease because visual acuity may remain good for many years. The atrophic stage usually occurs after age 40 years.

Birdshot chorioretinopathy
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Birdshot chorioretinopathy (koor-ee-oh-reht-in-OHP-ah-thee), or BSCR, is a rare inflammatory eye disease. It’s a long-term (chronic) condition that can lead to permanent vision changes or complete loss of sight.
BSCR is a severe form of uveitis, a group of diseases that damage eye tissue. It causes swelling of the:
Retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye.
Choroid, which connects your retina to the white part of your eye.
Hallmark signs of birdshot chorioretinopathy are cream-colored oval spots that are present in the deep retina and superficial (top layer) choroid. Early symptoms often involve floaters, blurred vision or both. The condition usually affects both eyes.
Over time, damage can cause cystoid macular edema or glaucoma. While there's no cure, birdshot chorioretinopathy is a treatable disease. Early detection is essential to the success of the treatment.
Who gets birdshot chorioretinopathy?
Anyone can develop birdshot chorioretinopathy. It most often affects middle-aged, white adults between the ages 40 and 60. It rarely affects children.
Are there other conditions like birdshot chorioretinopathy?
Several conditions, including other forms of uveitis, have symptoms that resemble birdshot chorioretinopathy. Getting an accurate diagnosis is crucial so you can get appropriate treatment. Conditions similar to BSCR include:
Lymphoma.
Sarcoidosis.
Sympathetic ophthalmia, a rare type of uveitis caused by trauma to your eye.
Syphilis.
Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS).
Tuberculosis.
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, a nervous system disease that affects vision and hearing.
A group of inflammatory conditions known as white dot syndromes also share symptoms of BSCR. They cause damage (lesions) to the retina and choroid and include:
Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE).
Multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis (MCP).
Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS).
Punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC).
Why is it called birdshot chorioretinopathy?
Birdshot chorioretinopathy is a relatively new disease, first described in 1949. In 1980, two eye specialists named it “birdshot chorioretinopathy” for its unique cream and orange oval-shaped spots scattered throughout the retina. The spots resemble the pattern from birdshot, small shotgun pellets (bullets).
Other names for birdshot chorioretinopathy are:
Birdshot chorioretinitis.
Birdshot retinochoroiditis.
Birdshot retinochoroidopathy.
Birdshot uveitis.
BSCR.
Posterior uveitis.
Vitiliginous choroiditis.
Causes
What causes birdshot chorioretinopathy?
Researchers don’t know the exact cause of birdshot chorioretinopathy. They suspect it may be an autoimmune disease, when your body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues.
More than 90% of people diagnosed with BSCR inherit (receive from their parents) a substance (antigen) called HLA-A29 that triggers an immune response. However, you don't need to have HLA-A29 to develop birdshot chorioretinopathy. You can also have the antigen and not get the disease.

and risk factors
Signs and symptoms
What are the symptoms of birdshot chorioretinopathy?
Symptoms of birdshot chorioretinopathy can vary. It's a progressive disease with symptoms that typically worsen over several months to years.
The first signs of birdshot chorioretinopathy are often floaters or blurred vision. BSCR does n't usually involve eye pain or redness. You may also experience:
Changing vision or vision loss.
Decreased ability to see to the side (peripheral vision) or judge depth.
High eye pressure (ocular hypertension).
Night blindness (nyctalopia).
Problems with color vision (color blindness) and telling certain colors apart (dyschromatopsia).
Sensitivity to bright lights or glare (photophobia).
Some people experience unusual changes in vision or perception. Symptoms may include:
Ceiling fan effect (when you close your eyes, you see something like a ceiling fan or pinwheel whirring around).
Seeing flashing or flickering lights (photopsia) or distorted shapes (metamorphopsia).
Shimmering blurred or hazy vision (like looking through water or dirty glass).
In severe cases, symptoms may include cataracts or glaucoma, which can cause severe vision loss even after inflammation is treated. Birdshot chorioretinopathy may also lead to issues with the central retina, including cystoid macular edema and epiretinal membranes.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Diagnosis of birdshot chorioretinopathy can be difficult. It's a rare disease, and its unique spots may not be visible in early stages of the disease.
Eye care specialists (ophthalmologists) most often diagnose BSCR with an eye exam. They also use a blood test to confirm that you have the HLA-A29 antigen.
Healthcare providers may use a combination of tests to monitor you over time. Stay in touch with your provider to receive the care you need.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
There's no cure for birdshot chorioretinopathy. But with timely diagnosis, treatment can reduce symptoms and prevent worsening of the disease.
Who might be on my treatment team for birdshot chorioretinopathy?
Your care team recommends treatment, monitors you and adjusts medications based on your condition and any side effects. Your team may include:
Eye specialist (ophthalmologist).
Kidney (renal) specialist (nephrologist).
Eye specialist with special training in immune disorders (ocular immunologist).
Inflammatory disease specialist (rheumatologist).
Musculoskeletal specialist (orthopaedist).
How is birdshot chorioretinopathy treated?
Treatment for birdshot chorioretinopathy depends on the severity of your condition and how it changes over time. The goal of treatment is to reduce swelling in your eyes and prevent or reverse vision loss.
Healthcare providers typically first recommend high doses of corticosteroids to control inflammation in your eye. They then lower the dose as much as possible due to the risk of side effects. You may receive steroids through:
Eye drops.
Oral medicines.
Implant placed surgically in your eye (intravitreal implant).
Injection.
IV (intravenously, through a vein).
Many people also need long-term treatment with immunosuppressants. These drugs stop your immune system from attacking your eyes and may include one or more:
Alkylating agents.
Antimetabolite drugs.
Biologic agents.
T-cell transduction/calcineurin inhibitors.
Are there any side effects from birdshot chorioretinopathy treatment?
Long-term steroid and immunosuppressant use can cause serious side effects, including gastrointestinal or bone issues. They may also increase your risk of developing cataracts or glaucoma.
Your healthcare provider will monitor you for any side effects and prescribe other medications if needed. If you're taking steroids by mouth, providers will check you for bone damage (osteoporosis) and fracture risk.
Your provider may also recommend a bone density scan. You may receive medication to prevent bone loss (bisphosphonates).
What kind of ongoing monitoring will I have for BSCR?
Watch your condition for any changes or complications. Your healthcare provider will check your blood and urine to make sure your kidneys, liver and bone marrow are working as they should. You are also likely to have regular eye exams, including visual field tests and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans.
Prevention tips
Prevention
There's no known way to prevent birdshot chorioretinopathy. In most cases, it's believed to be triggered by a specific antigen (a molecule that triggers an immune response) passed down in families.
Regular eye exams can help detect early symptoms, so you can receive timely treatment if needed. Tell your healthcare provider if any family members have eye disease.
Prognosis
Outlook / Prognosis
The outlook for birdshot chorioretinopathy varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. In milder cases, vision can remain stable or improve with treatment.
Living With
When should I seek care for birdshot chorioretinopathy?
Birdshot chorioretinopathy requires prompt diagnosis and treatment from an ophthalmologist. Even if your vision is fine, an eye exam can detect low levels of inflammation.
Alert your healthcare provider to any side effects of medication or change in symptoms or vision. You may receive different medications as needed. Your healthcare provider can discuss options that work best for you.

epidemiology
Birdshot chorioretinopathy is an unusual cause of ocular inflammation, and obtaining reliable incidence and prevalence data is difficult due to the rarity of the disease. Studies from Europe and the United States report that BCR accounts for between 0.5% and 1.5% of the uveitis cases seen in specialist uveitis practices. BCR is predominantly seen in the middle-aged, and some reports appear to be more common in females. In a systematic review from 2005, Shah et al. reported a mean age of disease onset of 53.0 years (512 patients), and a 54.1 % female preponderance (522 patients). Birdshot chorioretinopathy is most prevalent in White populations, is most commonly diagnosed in people of Northern European ancestry, with only the occasional case report of BCR in Latino-Hispanic, African-American, and Japanese people. The ethnic distribution is relevant to HLA-A29. HLA-A29 subtypes can be observed in many patients, with each subtype having a different prevalence.

Birdshot Chorioretinopathy: What It Is, Symptoms & Treatment
BLEPHARITIS
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Blepharitis is also known as “granulated eyelids”, or “eye dandruff”.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
Blepharitis is usually caused by an inflammation of the eyelids margin which causes redness, itching, and crusting. They may appear red, swollen, or feel like they are burning or sore. You may have flakes or oily particles (crusts) wrapped at the base of your eyelashes too. Blepharitis is very common, especially among people who have oily skin, dandruff or rosacea. 
Blepharitis (blef-uh-RYE-tis) is inflammation of the eyelids.  
Blepharitis commonly occurs when tiny oil glands near the base of the eyelashes become clogged, causing irritation and redness. Several diseases and conditions can cause blepharitis. 
Blepharitis is often a chronic condition that's difficult to treat. Blepharitis can be uncomfortable and unsightly. But it usually doesn't cause permanent damage to your eyesight, and it's not contagious.  5910.
Are there different types of blepharitis? 
There are two types of blepharitis, depending on where it’s located on your eyelids. They are: 
Anterior blepharitis: This type occurs when your eyelid’s front exterior, where the eyelashes come out of your lids, is red or darker in color and swollen, or when you have dandruff on your lashes. 
Posterior blepharitis: This type happens when the oil-producing meibomian glands under your eyelid produce thickened/unhealthy oil. 

CAUSES
The exact cause of blepharitis isn't clear. It might be associated with one or more of the following: 
Seborrheic dermatitis — dandruff of the scalp and eyebrows 
Infection 
Clogged or malfunctioning oil glands in your eyelids 
Rosacea — a skin condition characterized by facial redness 
Allergies (including allergic reactions to eye medications, contact lens solutions or eye makeup)
Eyelash mites or lice 
Dry eyes 
RISK FACTORS
Risk factors for developing blepharitis 
In addition to having rosacea and dandruff, you may be more at risk of developing blepharitis if you: 
Have diabetes. 
Wear contact lenses. 
Are exposed to irritants like dust and chemicals. 
Work or live in dry environments. This includes spending a lot of time in air conditioning. 
Have a high number of microbes that normally live on your skin. 
Don’t remove makeup thoroughly. 
Have oily skin. 
Are on certain drugs such as those for cancer treatment. 
Are going through menopause or hormonal changes. 
Do poor hygiene habits cause blepharitis? 
Poor hygiene can be a factor in blepharitis, but it’s not as simple as saying that only people with poor hygiene can get blepharitis. Hygiene is just a part of the reason that some people get blepharitis. 
If you think about it, most people don’t clean their eyelids and lashes every day or night. However, people with risk factors may have to make eyelid and eyelash hygiene a priority.  
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
Blepharitis signs and symptoms are typically worse in the morning. They include: 
Watery eyes 
Red eyes 
A gritty, burning or stinging sensation in the eyes 
Eyelids that appear greasy 
Itchy eyelids 
Red, swollen eyelids 
Flaking of the skin around the eyes 
Crusted eyelashes 
Eyelid sticking 
More frequent blinking 
Sensitivity to light 
Blurred vision that usually improves with blinking 

DIAGNOSIS METHODS
Tests and procedures used to diagnose blepharitis include: 
Examining your eyes. Your doctor might use a special magnifying instrument to examine your eyelids and your eyes. 
Swabbing skin for testing. In certain cases, your doctor might use a swab to collect a sample of the oil or crust that forms on your eyelid. This sample can be analyzed for bacteria, fungi or evidence of an allergy. 

TREATMENT OPTIONS
Self-care measures, such as washing your eyes and using warm compresses, might be all that's needed for most cases of blepharitis. If self-care measures aren't enough, your doctor might suggest prescription treatments, including: 
Medications that fight infection. Antibiotics applied to the eyelid have been shown to provide relief of symptoms and resolve bacterial infection of the eyelids. These are available in several forms, including eye drops, creams and ointments. 
If you don't respond to topical antibiotics, your doctor might suggest an oral antibiotic. 
Medications to control inflammation. Steroid eye drops or ointments are used for this, generally only for people who don't respond to other therapies. Your doctor might prescribe both antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Medications that affect the immune system. Topical cyclosporine (Restasis) has been shown to offer relief of some signs and symptoms of blepharitis. 
Treatments for underlying conditions. Blepharitis caused by seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea or other diseases might be controlled by treating the underlying disease. 
Other treatment options, such as using intense pulsed light might unclog the glands. More study is needed. 
Blepharitis rarely disappears completely. Even with successful treatment, the condition frequently is chronic and requires daily attention with eyelid scrubs. If you don't respond to treatment, or if you've also lost eyelashes or only one eye is affected, the condition could be caused by a localized eyelid cancer  
 
Self-care 
Self-care measures might be the only treatment needed for most cases of blepharitis. 

Clean your eyes daily 
If you have blepharitis, follow this self-care remedy two to four times a day during flare-ups and once or twice a day after the condition is under control: 
Apply a warm compress over your closed eye for a few minutes to loosen the crusty deposits on your eyelids. 
Firmly but gently massage the eyelids, using a clean washcloth or a clean finger. 
Immediately use a clean washcloth or cotton-tipped applicator moistened with warm water and a few drops of diluted baby shampoo or an over-the-counter eyelid cleanser to wash away oily debris or scales at the base of your eyelashes. Use a different clean cloth for each eye. 
In some cases, you might need to be more deliberate about cleaning the edge of your eyelids at your eyelashes. To do this, gently pull your eyelid away from your eye and use the washcloth to gently rub the base of the lashes. This helps avoid damaging your cornea with the washcloth. 
Ask your doctor whether you should use a topical antibiotic ointment after cleaning your eyelids in this way. 
Rinse your eyelids with warm water and gently pat them dry with a clean, dry towel. 
It might help to stop using eye makeup when your eyelids are inflamed. Makeup can make it harder to keep your eyelids clean and free of debris. Also, it's possible that makeup could reintroduce bacteria to the area or cause an allergic reaction. 

Lubricate your eyes 
Try over-the-counter artificial tears. These eye drops can help relieve dry eyes. 

Control dandruff and mites 
If you have dandruff that's contributing to your blepharitis, ask your doctor to recommend a dandruff shampoo. Using a dandruff shampoo might relieve your blepharitis signs and symptoms. 
Using tea tree oil shampoo on your eyelids daily might help deal with mites. Or try gently scrubbing your lids once a week with 50% tea tree oil, which is available over-the-counter. Contact your doctor if you don't see improvement in six weeks. And stop using tea tree oil if it irritates your skin or eyes. 

Alternative medicine 
No alternative medicine treatments have been proved to ease the symptoms of blepharitis. However, a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids or supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids might help blepharitis associated with rosacea. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in foods such as salmon, tuna, trout, flaxseed and walnuts. More study is needed.  
Keeping Blepharitis Under Control 
It is very important to keep your eyelids, skin and hair clean. This will help keep your blepharitis symptoms under control. Use baby shampoo diluted in warm water to gently scrub the eyelids/eyelashes daily when you have a crusting present. 
 
There are also wipes and some antiseptic sprays you can use to scrub to keep bacteria from growing too much. Scrub for about 15 seconds. Also, wash your hair, scalp and eyebrows with an antibacterial shampoo.  
Omega-3s (fish oil) 
Some people find relief from their symptoms with omega-3 fatty acids, which may help the oil glands in the eyelids work better. Fatty fish like salmon or sardines contain omega-3s but you can also buy fish oil pills at the drugstore. Ask your doctor if they might help you. 

PREVENTION TIPS
How do I prevent blepharitis? 
Many blepharitis cases aren’t preventable. Some risk factors for blepharitis, such as certain skin conditions, are beyond your control. Here are some steps you can take every day to help with the symptoms: 
Keep your hands, face and scalp clean. 
Try not to touch your itchy eyes or your face. Use a clean tissue if you must touch them. 
Remove all eye makeup before bedtime. 
Wipe away excess tears or eye drops with a clean tissue. 
Wear glasses instead of contact lenses until the condition clears. 
Use artificial tears if you have dry eyes and your provider agrees. 
Use anti-dandruff shampoo to wash your hair. 
Replace eye makeup — eyeliner, eye shadow, mascara — because they may have bacteria in the containers. You want to avoid reinfection. 

Prognosis
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
If you have blepharitis, you might also have: 
Eyelash problems. Blepharitis can cause your eyelashes to fall out, grow abnormally (misdirected eyelashes) or lose color. 
Eyelid skin problems. Scarring can develop on your eyelids from long-term blepharitis. Or the eyelid edges might turn inward or outward. 
Excess tearing or dry eyes. Abnormal oily secretions and other debris shed from the eyelids, such as flaking associated with dandruff, can build up in your tear film — the water, oil and mucus solution that forms tears. 
Abnormal tear film interferes with keeping your eyelids moist. This can irritate your eyes and cause symptoms of dry eyes or excess tearing. 
Stye. A stye is an infection that develops near the base of the eyelashes. The result is a painful lump on the edge of your eyelid. A stye is usually most visible on the surface of the eyelid. 
Chalazion. A chalazion occurs when there's a blockage in one of the small oil glands at the margin of the eyelid, just behind the eyelashes. This blockage causes inflammation of the gland, which makes the eyelid swell and redden. This can clear up or turn into a hard, nontender bump. 
Chronic pink eye. Blepharitis can lead to recurrent bouts of pink eye (conjunctivitis). 
Injury to the cornea. Constant irritation from inflamed eyelids or misdirected eyelashes can cause a sore to develop on your cornea. Not having enough tears could increase your risk of a corneal infection
When to see a doctor / red flag
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 
Differentiating blepharitis from other conditions is essential for ensuring appropriate treatment. Symptoms such as eyelid redness, scaling, and irritation overlap with ocular rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis, making these conditions important differential diagnoses. As MGD and eyelid telangiectasia are features shared by both posterior blepharitis and ocular rosacea, differentiation between the 2 conditions is challenging. However, systemic skin manifestations such as papules and facial flushing, which are common in rosacea, can provide valuable diagnostic clues. Scaling may appear around the eyes, eyebrows, and nasolabial folds in seborrheic dermatitis, which often coexists with seborrheic blepharitis. This condition is typically less inflammatory than bacterial blepharitis and responds well to topical steroids and antifungal treatments. A thorough skin examination can help differentiate seborrheic dermatitis from primary blepharitis, particularly when scaling is present in sebaceous-rich areas beyond the eyelids. Blepharitis can also be mistaken for infectious eyelid diseases such as molluscum contagiosum and HSV blepharitis. Patients with HSV blepharitis often have a history of prior herpes infections and may present with painful vesicular lesions on the eyelids. Molluscum contagiosum, typically seen in children or immunocompromised individuals, appears as small, dome-shaped papules along the eyelid margin. Accurate diagnosis is crucial, as these conditions require specific antiviral treatments that differ significantly from those used for blepharitis. Chronic eyelid conditions, such as sebaceous gland carcinoma and meibomian gland carcinoma, are rare but important differential diagnoses, especially in cases of asymmetric or unresponsive blepharitis. These cancers may initially present with eyelid thickening, scaling, and lash loss, which can mimic persistent blepharitis. However, any persistent lesion that does not resolve should raise suspicion for cancer and warrant a biopsy for diagnosis confirmation. Blepharitis can be confused with other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases affecting the eyelid margins, such as cicatricial pemphigoid and atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis often presents with widespread skin involvement, including eczematous changes and chronic skin thickening. In contrast, cicatricial pemphigoid, a rare autoimmune disorder, is distinguished from typical blepharitis by its potential to cause symblepharon and conjunctival scarring. A detailed assessment of systemic symptoms and medical history is essential to differentiate these conditions and determine the appropriate treatment approach. 
The differential diagnosis for blepharitis includes: 
Bacterial conjunctivitis 
Bacterial keratitis 
Basal cell carcinoma 
Chalazion 
Contact lens complications 
Dry eye disease 
Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis 
Hordeolum 
Ocular rosacea 
Trichiasis 
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
Blepharitis is not specific to any particular group, affecting individuals of all ages, ethnicities, and genders. Estimates suggest that between 37% and 47% of patients treated by eye care specialists in the United States have blepharitis, making it one of the most common ocular disorders seen in clinical practice. Although blepharitis can affect people of all ages and ethnic backgrounds, its prevalence tends to increase with age, likely due to the impact of the normal aging process on meibomian gland function. The condition is most commonly seen in individuals aged 50 or older.
A major cross-sectional study conducted in Spain highlighted the prevalence of blepharitis, showing that symptomatic and asymptomatic MGD affected approximately 21.9% and 8.6% of the general population, respectively. A 10-year study conducted in South Korea (2004–2013) determined the overall incidence of blepharitis to be 1.1 per 100 person-years. The incidence increased over time and was higher in female patients. The prevalence for individuals aged 40 or older was 8.8%.
The epidemiology of blepharitis also appears to be influenced by gender. Some research suggests that women are more likely to be affected by certain subtypes of blepharitis, including staphylococcal blepharitis. For example, a single-center study found that women, with an average age of 42, comprised most patients with staphylococcal blepharitis. MGD and posterior blepharitis are more commonly observed in older populations, where age-related changes in glandular secretions and gland dysfunction are more prevalent. This condition, which links dermatological disorders with ocular manifestations, is also more frequently seen in populations with a higher incidence of rosacea

BLOCKED TEAR DUCT
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Blocked tear duct is also known as “dacryostenosis”; it can also be referred to as a “congenital lacrimal duct obstruction”.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
A blocked tear duct is a condition that happens when something keeps tear fluid from draining out of your eyes properly. These blockages slow or stop the flow of tear fluid, causing it to back up in the tear duct system and into your affected eye. The medical term for this condition is “nasolacrimal duct obstruction.” 
Your eyes need tear fluid to work properly. Your tear fluid lubricates the surface of your eye and helps your corneas absorb oxygen. Tear fluid also contains immune factors that protect against, or help your eyes recover from, infections. 
You can think of your tear system like the gutters and downspouts on a house. The gutters channel water toward the downspout. But a blockage or clog in the downspout can make water back up and spill over the gutters’ edges. 
The tear duct system is a series of openings and tubelike structures. The route that tear fluid follows to leave your eyes is: 
The puncta. Each eye has two puncta (the term for just one is “punctum”), one on your upper eyelid and another on the lower. They’re like the drain in a sink or bathtub, letting tear fluid flow out and into the canaliculi. 
The canaliculi. Each punctum drains into a canaliculus (the term for more than one is “canaliculi”). These canaliculi (pronounced “can-al-ICK-yew-lye”) merge and form a single tube before draining into the nasolacrimal ducts. 
The nasolacrimal ducts. The nasolacrimal (pronounced “nay-zo-LACK-rim-al”) ducts are the final tubelike areas that tear fluid travels through. At the bottom of each tear duct, there should be a valve. 
The valve of Hasner. This valve is just an opening that lets tear fluid drain into your nasal passages. Normally, it opens on its own before you’re born. But some babies have a valve that hasn’t opened yet. If it isn’t open, it’s called the membrane of Hasner. 

How common are tear duct blockages? 
Tear duct blockages are common in very young children, affecting between 6% and 20% of infants. They’re much less common in adults. 

CAUSES
What causes tear duct blockage? 
Tear duct blockages can happen for a few different reasons. Some are congenital, meaning you have them when you’re born. Others develop later in life. 
Congenital tear duct blockage 
Congenital tear duct obstruction usually happens because a child still has an unbroken membrane where the valve of Hasner should be. That means fluid can build up inside the lacrimal duct. Over time, the accumulated tear fluid can cause the duct to expand. It can also lead to an infection of the tear duct or other parts of the tear system. 
Other causes of tear duct blockage 
Tear duct blockages can also happen because of other conditions or be more likely to happen under certain circumstances. These are more likely to happen higher up in your tear duct system (or in parts that aren’t technically tear ducts, but they connect to the ducts). 
Examples include: 
Infections. Chronic infections of your eyes or surrounding areas can contribute to scar tissue buildup. Sometimes, that scar tissue can cause narrowing and form a blockage. 
Injuries. Trauma to your face, eye or nose can cause swelling and tissue changes around your tear system. Swelling or tissue changes affecting any part of the system can cause or contribute to a blockage. 
Narrow tear ducts (dacryostenosis). Sometimes, your tear ducts are narrow when you’re born, or they get narrower during your lifetime. Either can cause or contribute to a blockage. 
Aging. Your tear ducts and surrounding areas can change and narrow as you age. 
Tumors or growths. This includes benign (harmless) growths or cancerous tumors (but these are rare). Growths called mucoceles can also cause blockages in your tear ducts. These are small, mucus-filled pockets that can develop in the neighboring sinuses (the ethmoid sinuses on either side of your nose are right next to the tear system). 
Tear stones (dacryoliths). These can form when tear fluid collects and hardens. If these are big enough, they can block a tear duct. 

RISK FACTORS
Babies have the highest chance of developing a blocked tear duct. Blockages usually happen because the membrane at the bottom of the tear nasolacrimal duct doesn’t open and become the valve of Hasner. 
Adults are more likely to develop a tear duct blockage if they have a history of: 
Chronic eye inflammation, such as uveitis. 
Glaucoma. 
Eye or sinus surgery. 
Previous cancer treatment, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy. 

SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
What are the symptoms of a blocked tear duct? 
The symptoms of a blocked tear duct can include: 
Watery eyes (epiphora). 
Gooey or crusty buildup on your eyelids or in your eyelashes. 
Frequent rubbing of your eye or face around the blocked duct. 
Redness and swelling (from rubbing). 
Blurred vision. 
These blockages can also make it easier to develop infections in the tear ducts. Infection symptoms can include: 
Swelling or redness of the tear duct or nearby tissues. 
Fever. 
Fussiness or irritability (especially in babies). 
Eye pain or sinus pressure. 
Redness or irritation of the eyeball, especially the sclera (the white part of your eye). 

DIAGNOSIS METHODS
How is a blocked tear duct diagnosed? 
An eye care specialist or healthcare provider can usually diagnose a blocked tear duct based on your symptoms and by inspecting or feeling around your eye and tear duct. They’ll also ask you about your symptoms. If your baby might have a blocked tear duct, they can also check for this or do certain tests to look for a blockage. 
One simple test they can do is called the “dye disappearance test.” To do it, a provider adds a drop of a special dye called fluorescein to your eye. Fluorescein glows under a blue light, so a provider can put a single drop of it into saline and then put the saline into your eye. After five minutes, they can check with a black light and see if any dye remains. If it’s still there, that can indicate you have a total or partial tear duct blockage. 
Other tests are also possible, especially if your healthcare provider suspects that a blocked tear duct might be happening because of another condition or issue. The tests they recommend depend on your symptoms, circumstances and what condition they suspect could be the cause. 
Because so many factors can play a role, it’s best to talk with them about the testing options. They can provide information that’s specific and relevant to your particular situation. 
TREATMENT OPTIONS
Management and Treatment 
How is a blocked tear duct treated, and is there a cure? 
A blocked tear duct is very treatable. But the treatments are different depending on the age of the person who has it and other factors. This condition can get better without treatment, especially in babies, but it’s better to try and treat it to avoid complications like infections. 
Some treatments, like antibiotics, are possible no matter your age. These are most likely if you have an infection related to a blocked tear duct, and they can come in topical or eye drop forms. Other medications may also help. Your eye care specialist is the best person to tell you more about these options. 
The main treatment for babies and infants with a blocked tear duct is a special massage technique that you can do at home. If your child or a child you care for has it, their pediatrician can show you exactly how to do this. This massage technique is usually all it takes to make the membrane pop open and become a valve. 
If the blockage doesn’t get better with massage by the time a child has their first birthday, it’s more likely they’ll need a different treatment approach. Massaging also isn’t likely to help adults, so other treatments are usually necessary. 
Some of these treatments may need to happen under sedation or anesthesia. Your (or your child’s) eye care specialist or provider can tell you if and why they recommend sedation or anesthesia. 
Dilation, probing and irrigation 
One of the simpler approaches to treating a blocked tear duct is a three-step technique called dilation, probing and irrigation. This technique can help babies if massage isn’t helpful. It’s also a likely first treatment for older children and adults. The steps of the technique work like so: 
Dilation. To do this first step, an eye care specialist will dilate (widen) the puncta and other tear system structures on the affected side. That makes room for what will happen in the next step. 
Probing. For this step, an eye care specialist will use the special tool(s) to probe (explore) the blocked part of the tear system. That helps them find the cause of the blockage and remove it, if possible. 
Irrigation. This final step involves pushing saline fluid through the tear duct to make sure it’s clear and wide enough. 

Balloon dilation 
In cases where simple dilation, probing and irrigation aren’t enough, a more advanced type of dilation may be necessary. When this is the case, your child’s eye care specialist will use a tool with a tiny balloon attachment on it. They’ll inflate the balloon slowly and gently in narrowed areas. Pushing like this from the inside can often widen the duct and resolve the issue. 

Stenting or intubation 
In some cases, balloon dilation may not be enough to widen a narrow tear duct permanently. In these cases, inserting a tube or stent might be the best approach. These devices provide a sturdy, hollow framework that can hold the duct open and still let tear fluid flow through. 
Surgical procedures 
In some cases, surgery may be the best choice to fix a blocked tear duct or reroute tear fluid around it. Two main surgeries are possible: 
Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). For this procedure, a surgeon creates a bypass route for tear fluid to flow through. The new route will completely bypass the existing blockage. 
Conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy (CDCR). This procedure reconstructs your entire tear duct system. 
The advantages, disadvantages and possible complications of the surgical procedures vary widely. The type of blockage you have, where it is and other factors can all play a role. Your surgeon or eye care specialist is the best source of information about what you can expect. 
PREVENTION TIPS
Tear duct blockages happen for reasons that are unpredictable, outside your control or that you can’t see happening. That means there’s no way to prevent them. 
There are a few things you can do to reduce the odds of an issue that could lead to a blockage, though. These mainly revolve around avoiding infections, including the following precautions: 
Avoid rubbing or excessively touching your eyes. 
Avoid sharing eye products, such as eye drops or cosmetics. 
Clean contact lenses according to your eye care provider’s instructions. 
Replace cosmetics — such as mascara, eyeliner or eyeshadow — every three to six months. 
Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. 

OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
Tear duct blockages usually have a positive outlook, depending on why they happen. Tear duct blockages aren’t dangerous on their own. But some of the causes can be. And blockages can lead to dangerous infections, so getting a blockage diagnosed and treated is important. 
Congenital blockages have an excellent outlook. About 70% of children with these blockages get better by the time they’re 6 months old, and 90% get better by their first birthday. While blockages can go away spontaneously, the massage technique speeds up that process and reduces the chance of an infection or other issues. Congenital blockages also usually don’t cause problems later in life. 
In adults, the outlook is generally good, depending on the cause. Most causes, especially injury-related causes, respond well to treatment, and many approaches can help. Your eye care specialist can tell you more about which treatments are most likely to help, the outcome you can expect, and what you can do to improve that outcome. 
Living With 
How do I take care of myself? 
If you have (or a child you care for has) a tear duct blockage, an eye care specialist can guide you on treating and managing it. You shouldn’t try to self-diagnose or self-treat a tear duct blockage. If you think you have symptoms of a blockage, you should schedule an appointment with an eye care specialist and see them as soon as possible. 
When should I see my healthcare provider, or when should I seek care? 
If you have a tear duct blockage, your eye care specialist will give you treatment instructions and guidance. You can also ask them about the signs and symptoms that mean you need to call them or seek medical care more quickly. 
What questions should I ask my doctor? 
You may want to ask your eye care specialist or healthcare provider the following: 
What’s the most likely cause of a blocked tear duct? 
What treatments do you recommend? 
Are there any treatment side effects? 
Is the tear duct blockage related to another medical condition? 
How can I prevent the blockage from returning? 

The differential diagnosis is broad and includes conjunctivitis, corneal abrasion, uveitis hemangiomas, dermoid, nasal gliomas, and infantile glaucoma. The absence of associated signs and symptoms distinguishes congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) from other causes of persistent tearing. 
Most infants with congenital NLDO can be diagnosed and managed by the primary care practitioner. Referral to an ophthalmologist is warranted if the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly if there is any concern of glaucoma or signs or symptoms of dacryocystitis or dacryocystocele.  

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
A blocked tear duct is just the kind of place where bacteria find it easy to grow, so bacterial infections or abscesses are the main possible complications of a blocked tear duct. The infections can also affect your sinuses, eyes and other nearby tissues. That’s why treating and keeping the infection from spreading is very important

Cataracts
Definition and description
A Cataract is when there is a clouding of the eye's lens, leading to vision loss and blindness if untreated. Early cataracts may be managed with an adjustment in glasses prescription, but surgery may be necessary when vision is significantly impaired. It is one of the leading cause of blindness worldwide and a major cause of vision loss in the U.S.16
A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye, which is typically clear. For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window. Clouded vision caused by cataracts can make it more difficult to read, drive a car at night or see the expression on a friend's face. 
Most cataracts develop slowly and don't disturb eyesight early on. But with time, cataracts will eventually affect vision. 
At first, stronger lighting and eyeglasses can help deal with cataracts. But if impaired vision affects usual activities, cataract surgery might be needed. Fortunately, cataract surgery is generally a safe, effective procedure. 
Types of cataracts 
Cataract types include: 
Cataracts affecting the center of the lens, called nuclear cataracts. A nuclear cataract may at first cause objects far away to be blurry but objects up close to look clear. A nuclear cataract may even improve your reading vision for a short time. But with time, the lens slowly turns more yellow or brown and makes your vision worse. It may become difficult to tell colors apart. 
Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens, called cortical cataracts. A cortical cataract begins as white, wedge-shaped spots or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As the cataract slowly grows, the streaks spread to the center and affect light passing through the lens. 
Cataracts that affect the back of the lens, called posterior subcapsular cataracts. A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small spot that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often affects your reading vision. It also may reduce your vision in bright light and cause glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to grow faster than others. 
Cataracts you're born with, called congenital cataracts. Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. These cataracts may be passed down from parents. They also may be associated with an infection or trauma while in the womb. 
These cataracts also may be due to certain conditions. These may include myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision. If they do, they're usually removed soon after they're found. 
Causes 
Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up the eye's lens. Proteins and fibers in the lens begin to break down. This causes vision to become hazy or cloudy. 
Some disorders passed down from parents that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. Cataracts also can be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medicines also may cause cataracts to develop. 
How a cataract forms 
A cataract is a cloudy lens. The lens sits behind the colored part of your eye, called the iris. The lens focuses light that passes into your eye. This produces clear, sharp images on the back part of the eye, called the retina. 
As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less clear and thicker. Aging and some medical conditions can cause proteins and fibers within the lenses to break down and clump together. This is what causes the clouding in the lenses. 
As the cataract grows, the clouding becomes worse. A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens. This prevents a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred. 
Cataracts usually happen in both eyes, but not always at the same rate. The cataract in one eye may be worse than the other. This causes a difference in vision between eyes. 
Risk factors 
Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include: 
Increasing age. 
Diabetes. 
Getting too much sunlight. 
Smoking. 
Obesity. 
Family history of cataracts. 
Previous eye injury or inflammation. 
Previous eye surgery. 
Prolonged use of corticosteroid medicines. 
Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. 

Signs and symptoms
Symptoms 
Symptoms of cataracts include: 
Clouded, blurred or dim vision. 
Trouble seeing at night. 
Sensitivity to light and glare. 
Need for brighter light for reading and other activities. 
Seeing "halos" around lights. 
Frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription. 
Fading or yellowing of colors. 
Double vision in one eye. 
At first, the cloudiness in your vision caused by a cataract may affect only a small part of the eye's lens. You may not notice any vision loss. As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens. More clouding changes the light passing through the lens. This may lead to symptoms you notice more. 
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Diagnosis 
To determine whether you have a cataract, your eye doctor will review your medical history and symptoms. They also will perform an eye exam. Your doctor may do several tests, including: 
Vision test. A vision test, also called a visual acuity test, uses an eye chart to measure how well you can read a series of letters. One eye is tested at a time, while the other eye is covered. A chart or a viewing device with letters that get smaller is used. With this, your eye doctor determines if you have 20/20 vision or if you have trouble seeing. 
Eye structure exam. An eye structure exam, also called a slit lamp, allows your eye doctor to see the structures at the front of your eye up close. It's called a slit lamp because it uses an intense line of light, a slit, to light up the structures in your eye. The slit allows your doctor to view these structures in small sections. This makes it easier to find anything that may be wrong. 
Retinal exam. A retinal exam looks at the back of your eyes, called the retina. To prepare for a retinal exam, your eye doctor puts drops in your eyes to open your pupils wide, called dilation. This makes it easier to see the retina. Using a slit lamp or a special device called an ophthalmoscope, your eye doctor can examine your lens for signs of a cataract. 
Fluid pressure test. This test, also called applanation tonometry, measures fluid pressure in your eye. There are multiple different devices available to do this. 
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Treatment 
When your prescription glasses can't clear your vision, the only effective treatment for cataracts is surgery. 
When to consider cataract surgery 
Talk with your eye doctor about whether surgery is right for you. Most eye doctors suggest considering cataract surgery when your cataracts begin to affect your quality of life. This may include your ability to perform daily activities, such as reading or driving at night. 
For most people, there is no rush to remove cataracts because they usually don't harm the eyes. But cataracts can worsen faster in people with certain conditions. These include diabetes, high blood pressure or obesity. 
Waiting to do cataract surgery typically won't affect how well your vision recovers. Take time to consider the benefits and risks of cataract surgery with your doctor. 
If you choose not to have cataract surgery now, your eye doctor may recommend periodic follow-up exams to see if your cataracts are getting worse. How often you'll see your eye doctor depends on your situation. 
What happens during cataract surgery 
Cataract surgery involves removing the clouded lens and replacing it with a clear artificial lens. The artificial lens, called an intraocular lens, is put in the same place as your natural lens. It remains a permanent part of your eye. 
For some people, artificial lenses can't be used. In these situations, once the cataract is removed, vision may be corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses. 
Cataract surgery is typically done on an outpatient basis. This means you won't need to stay in a hospital after the surgery. During surgery, your eye doctor uses a medicine to numb the area around your eye. You usually stay awake during the procedure. 
Cataract surgery is generally safe. However, it carries a risk of infection and bleeding. Cataract surgery also increases the risk of the retina being pulled out of place. This is called retinal detachment. 
After the procedure, you may be sore for a few days. Healing usually happens within a few weeks. 
If you need cataract surgery in both eyes, your doctor will schedule surgery to remove the cataract in the second eye after you've healed from the first surgery. 
Lifestyle and home remedies 
To deal with symptoms of cataracts until you decide to have surgery, try to: 
Make sure your prescription for your eyeglasses or contact lenses is up to date. 
Use a magnifying glass to read if you need more help reading. 
Improve the lighting in your home with more or brighter lamps. 
Wear sunglasses or a broad-brimmed hat to reduce glare during the day. 
Limit driving at night. 
Self-care measures may help for a while, but your vision may get worse as the cataract grows. When vision loss starts to affect your everyday activities, consider cataract surgery. 
Preparing for your appointment 
Make an appointment with your usual eye care professional if you notice changes in your vision. If they determine that you have cataracts, then you may be referred to an eye specialist who can perform cataract surgery. 
There's often a lot to talk about. It's a good idea to be well prepared for your appointment so that you can make the most of your time. Here's some information to help you get ready. 
What you can do 
List any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may not seem related to the reason you scheduled the appointment. 
Make a list of all medicines, vitamins or supplements that you're taking. 
Take a family member or friend along. Sometimes it can be difficult to absorb all the information provided during an appointment. Someone who comes with you may remember something that you missed or forgot. 
List questions to ask your health care team. 
For cataracts, some basic questions to ask include: 
Are cataracts causing my vision problems? 
What kinds of tests do I need? 
Will cataract surgery correct my vision problems? 
What are the potential risks of cataract surgery? Are there risks in waiting to do surgery? 
What will cataract surgery cost, and will my insurance cover it? 
How much time will I need to recover from cataract surgery? 
Will any usual activities be restricted after cataract surgery? For how long? 
After cataract surgery, how long should I wait before getting new glasses? 
If I use Medicare, will it cover the cost of cataract surgery? Does Medicare cover the cost of new glasses after surgery? 
If I don't want surgery right now, what else can I do to help with my vision changes? 
How will I know if my cataracts are getting worse? 
I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together? 
Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend? 
In addition to the questions that you've prepared, don't hesitate to ask questions at any time if you don't understand something. 
What to expect from your doctor 
Your health care team is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may allow more time later to cover other points you want to address. You may be asked: 
When did you begin having symptoms? 
Do you have your symptoms all the time or do they come and go? 
Do you have vision problems in bright light? 
Have your symptoms gotten worse? 
Do your vision problems make it difficult for you to drive? 
Do your vision problems make it difficult to read? 
Do your vision problems make it difficult to do your job? 
Have you ever had an eye injury or eye surgery? 
Have you ever been diagnosed with an eye problem, such as inflammation of your iris? 
Have you ever received radiation therapy to your head or neck? 
Prevention tips
Prevention 
No studies have proved how to prevent or slow the growth of cataracts. But health care professionals think several strategies may be helpful, including: 
Regular eye exams. Eye exams can help detect cataracts and other eye problems at their earliest stages. Ask your health care team how often you should have an eye examination. 
Do not smoke. Ask a member of your health care team how to stop smoking. Medicines, counseling and other strategies are available to help you. 
Manage other health problems. Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts. 
Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables. Adding fruits and vegetables to your diet ensures that you're getting many vitamins and nutrients. Fruits and vegetables have antioxidants. Antioxidants help maintain the health of your eyes. 
Studies haven't proved that antioxidants in pill form can prevent cataracts. But a large population study recently showed that a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals reduced the risk of developing cataracts. Fruits and vegetables have many proven health benefits. Eating them is a safe way to get enough minerals and vitamins in your diet. 
Wear sunglasses. Ultraviolet light from the sun may cause cataracts. Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet B rays when you're outdoors. 
Reduce alcohol use. Drinking too much alcohol can increase the risk of cataracts.

Charles Bonnet syndrome
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Charles Bonnet syndrome (pronounced “bo NAY”) is a condition that happens when a person with low vision has visual hallucinations. 

The eye’s retina facilitates the conversion of light into a visual message for the brain. When you’re not able to do this, your vision gets worse and you become more likely to develop Charles Bonnet syndrome. 

The hallucinations can be simple, like bright-colored patterns that show up over everything you see. The medical term for this is unformed hallucinations. 

You can also see more complicated things, like animals, buildings or people that don’t exist. The medical term for this is formed hallucinations. 

How does Charles Bonnet syndrome affect my body? 

Although scientists aren’t quite sure of the pathophysiology behind Charles Bonnet syndrome, they think that the hallucinations happen because lower vision reduces the number of images your brain gets. Your brain wants more images, so it uses memories to recall things that it’s seen or simply makes things up. 

This can be worrisome and confusing if you don’t know what’s happening. 

Who does Charles Bonnet syndrome affect? 

Charles Bonnet syndrome can affect people with conditions that cause vision loss, such as age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). One study indicated that more than 12% of people with ARMD will develop Charles Bonnet syndrome. 

An estimated 1 in 2 people with severely impaired vision may develop hallucinations. Charles Bonnet syndrome can happen in anyone, but it’s more frequent in patients 80 years or older. 

In addition to AMRD, other conditions related to developing Charles Bonnet syndrome include: 

Stroke. 

Cataracts. 

Glaucoma. 

Retinitis pigmentosa. 

Diabetes-related retinopathy. 

Optic neuritis. 

Giant cell arteritis. 

Eye removal. 

Causes 
Causes Charles Bonnet syndrome? 
The cause of Charles Bonnet syndrome is related to loss of vision. A main theory is that your brain wants images and isn’t getting enough, so it creates them. 

Some studies have indicated that what you see suppresses some nerve activity in your brain. When your eyes aren’t supplying that type of suppression, nerve activity in the brain appears as visual hallucinations. 

What are risk factors for Charles Bonnet syndrome? 
Risk factors for Charles Bonnet syndrome include: 

Being 80 years old or older. 

Having low vision. 

Being alone/socially isolated. 

Being in a dark environment. 

Signs and symptoms
The key symptom of Charles Bonnet syndrome is seeing hallucinations. These hallucinations may appear as: 

Patterns made up of lines or shapes that repeat. These images might look like bricks or nets. 

Imaginary animals like dragons or unicorns. 

Outdoor scenes, like waterfalls, trees or mountains. 

People’s faces, people, animals or bugs. 

People dressed as if they were living in the past. 

The images may: 

Move or stay in one place. 

Be in color or be in black and white. 

Be true to size or be smaller than normal. 

Be pleasant or be scary. 

Be familiar to you or not familiar to you. 

Be the same each time they happen or change each time they happen. 

These visions usually happen without noise. They can continue for various lengths of time from seconds to minutes to hours. 
Most people with Charles Bonnet syndrome know that what they’re seeing isn’t real. 
People with Charles Bonnet syndrome can’t control the hallucinations. 

Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Your healthcare provider or eye care specialist will take your medical history, ask questions about your symptoms and do thorough physical and eye examinations. 

It’s possible to have hallucinations when you’re taking certain medications. It’s also possible to have hallucinations if you’re withdrawing from using drugs or alcohol. You can also have hallucinations after cataract surgery. 

Your providers will want to eliminate any other conditions that could possibly cause hallucinations, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and schizophrenia. 

Your providers may recommend neurological tests to rule out these other diseases. 

Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment 

There’s no cure for Charles Bonnet syndrome. Providers have tried medications but they didn’t work. Symptoms often improve with time, possibly because your brain becomes used to receiving fewer images to process. However, it may take years for the hallucinations to stop. 

How can I manage symptoms of Charles Bonnet syndrome? 

If you have Charles Bonnet syndrome, you may be able to manage symptoms better with the following tips. 

Managing Charles Bonnet syndrome with eye movements 

You may want to blink your eyes or close your eyes. You might want to look away from the hallucination or stare at it. You can also try moving your eyes without moving your head, looking from side to side or up and down. 

Managing Charles Bonnet syndrome with improved lighting 

You may find it easier to deal with Charles Bonnet syndrome if you have brighter light, especially in the evenings. 

Managing Charles Bonnet syndrome by being less isolated 

It may help you to spend less time alone and spend more time with people. The people you spend time with should be people you can talk to about your life, including the images you’re seeing. You may want to find a support group to improve your connections. 

Managing Charles Bonnet syndrome with rest and relaxation 

Some people have found that their symptoms get worse when they’re under stress or don’t get enough rest. Try to get enough sleep and to develop other ways to relax and to relieve stress. These could include practices like meditation, deep breathing and learning to relax your muscles in a progressive way. 

In addition to these suggestions, your provider may suggest anti-anxiety medications or antidepressants to help you deal with your emotions and uncertainties. 

Prevention tips
Prevention  
Since researchers don’t really know what causes Charles Bonnet syndrome, there’s no concrete way to prevent it. You may be able to reduce your risk by taking certain steps to preserve your vision. For instance, if you have diabetes, you can do your best to manage your blood sugar levels. 

It’s very important for everyone to have regular eye exams. This is especially true as people age, since many of the causes of vision loss happen as people get older. 

It’s important to have a good relationship with your ophthalmologist or other eye care provider. 

Prognosis
Outlook / Prognosis 

What can I expect if I have Charles Bonnet syndrome? 

There’s no cure for Charles Bonnet syndrome. It may disappear over time, but it may take one to two years to go away. 

You may find it difficult to do some of your daily tasks or walk in places that you don’t know well if you’re seeing things that aren’t there. It’s important to tell your healthcare provider about it. 

Living With 

What questions should I ask my healthcare team about Charles Bonnet syndrome? 

You may have many questions for your providers about Charles Bonnet syndrome. Some of them may include: 

Are there certain tests you would recommend to determine if I actually do have Charles Bonnet syndrome? 

Can you recommend a support group for me? 

Would I benefit from being in a clinical trial? 

How can I deal with the condition that’s causing my vision loss? 

Can you suggest ways for me to deal with Charles Bonnet syndrome? 

Additional Common Questions 

What is the difference between Charles Bonnet syndrome and Anton syndrome? 

If you have Charles Bonnet syndrome, you see hallucinations and you know that they’re not real. If you have Anton syndrome, you can’t see but claim that you can. You tell people that you’re seeing things that you really aren’t seeing. You deny your blindness, which has often occurred after a cerebrovascular injury.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Essential considerations for differential diagnosis pertain to etiologies involving visual hallucinations. These include
Narcolepsy
Peduncular hallucinosis
Levodopa-induced hallucinations
Hypnagogic hallucinations
Migraine coma
Schizophrenia
Epileptic seizures
Dementia
Migraine aura
Neurodegenerative - Parkinson, Alzheimer, and Lewy body dementia
Metabolic encephalopathy - drugs, alcohol withdrawal, or delirium
CBS is differentiated from all these conditions by the simultaneous presence of visual deficits and the absence of neurological deficits. Furthermore, CBS is differentiated by the lack of auditory or sensory-associated hallucinations, which can be seen in many of the above differentials.
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
The incidence and prevalence of CBS are still under investigation and require further research. However, various studies and surveys indicate that the condition is not as uncommon as one might think. CBS prevalence has been found to differ widely depending on different sample sizes, with estimates ranging from 1% to nearly 10%.
One large study aimed at investigating CBS found the overall prevalence to be 0.5% (5/1000), with 0.8% (1/120) of their sample being in those with low visual acuity, 0.6% (2/346) being in the elderly, and 0.8% (1/120) being in both the elderly and those with low visual acuity.
Further highlighting the predominance in those with a higher degree of visual impairment or even more in those with complete vision loss, a study comparing visual hallucinations in people with macular disease versus people with glaucoma involved in a visual rehabilitation found the prevalence of CBS to be 39% and 20% respectively.
Regarding age, CBS can affect all ages; however, it tends to be more prevalent in older individuals. Data on CBS shows the mean age of the condition to be 70 to 85 years old, the expected range where pathological processes leading to visual impairment or vision loss naturally occur.
However, literature has suggested that CBS is vastly under-reported, mainly due to patients fearing being diagnosed with a psychiatric illness. For instance, one study found that a significant number of patients are unaware of the disease, with only 12% of patients in a retinal clinic knowing of CBS. In contrast, another study found that visual hallucinations were reported in only 11 to 15% of older individuals with impaired vision.
CBS is more common in older patients. Previous reports have revealed the mean age of incidence ranging from 74 to 84 years. CBS has also been reported in children having a high incidence of rapid visual loss. The incidence of profound visual loss is also reported more commonly in the elderly. De Morsier noted a male preponderance; some studies showed a female preponderance, while some showed no sex bias.

CENTRAL SEROUS RETINOPATHY
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Central serous retinopathy is a medical condition that occurs when fluid builds up behind the retina in your eye. The fluid comes from a layer of blood vessels beneath your retina called the choroid. This fluid can cause your retina to detach, leading to vision loss or other vision problems. 
Your retina is a layer of tissue behind each eye. It senses light and translates it into images your brain can understand. 
Other names for central serous retinopathy include: 
Central serous chorioretinopathy 
Central serous choroidopathy 
Central serous retinopathy affects about 10 out of every 100,000 people, depending on your sex and other risk factors. 
Causes
Central serous chorioretinopathy causes 
Scientists don’t fully understand what causes central serous retinopathy. Stress appears to play a key role. Stress makes your body release a hormone called cortisol, which can cause inflammation and fluid leakage. People with high stress levels and reduced coping skills are at a higher risk for central serous retinopathy. 
The condition is also associated with the use of medications containing corticosteroids, which treat inflammation. 
Risk factors for central serous retinopathy 
Central serous retinopathy can affect anyone, but it’s more common in: 
Males between the ages of 30 and 50 
People with myopia (nearsightedness) 
Those taking certain medications, especially corticosteroids 
Other risk factors include: 
Autoimmune diseases, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis 
Heart disease or high blood pressure 
Infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori 
Kidney disease, like glomerulonephritis 
Pregnancy 
Sleep problems, like sleep apnea and insomnia 
Use of certain medications, like those that treat nasal congestion and erectile dysfunction 
Signs and symptoms
Central serous retinopathy can affect one eye or both at the same time. Central serous chorioretinopathy symptoms may include: 
Blurry vision, like a smudge in the center of your sight 
Dark spot in the center of your vision 
Darker or dim vision 
White items look dull or somewhat brown 
Objects seem smaller or further away than they are 
Straight lines look crooked or bent 
But central serous chorioretinopathy doesn’t always cause symptoms. A person can have the condition but not have vision problems. 
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
If you have changes to your vision, seek medical attention from your primary care provider or an ophthalmologist (eye specialist). They’ll talk to you about your symptoms and perform an eye exam. They may also order certain retina tests, including: 
Fluorescein angiography (IVFA). A healthcare provider injects a dye into a vein in your arm that spreads to your retina. Then, they take pictures with a special camera to identify leaks. 
Optical coherence tomography (OCT). A scan that provides 3D pictures of your retina so your provider can measure retinal thickness, identify swelling and detect serous retinal detachment. 
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment  
Many cases of central serous retinopathy go away on their own over a few weeks or months. Your healthcare provider may recommend monitoring, or a “watch and wait” approach. During the monitoring period, they’ll repeat tests to ensure the fluid is draining. 
Your provider may also ask you to stop taking medications that contribute to the eye condition. They’ll counsel you to reduce your stress levels. 
If the fluid doesn’t drain on its own in a few months, your provider may recommend central serous chorioretinopathy treatment, including: 
Medications. Some medications, like anti-vascular endothelial growth factors, can prevent new blood vessels from growing in your eyes. Certain diuretics can help reduce fluid. 
Photodynamic therapy (PDT). A healthcare provider injects a drug called verteporfin into your arm that travels to your eye. Then, they use a cold laser to close the leak. 
Other laser treatments. After giving you numbing medications, your provider may use thermal laser treatment (a heated laser) to seal leaks. Micropulse laser uses smaller, shorter laser pulses. 
How do I take care of myself with central serous retinopathy? 
Some lifestyle changes can help you manage central serous retinopathy: 
Get at least seven hours of sleep every night 
Limit caffeine, alcohol and corticosteroids 
Manage and reduce stress with exercise, meditation, time with loved ones or counseling 
If you’re experiencing vision loss, some coping strategies include: 
Joining a support group to meet people who understand 
Talking to loved ones or a counselor about your feelings and ways to cope 
Using aids to help you complete daily tasks safely 
Prevention tips
Prognosis
Outlook / Prognosis 
Many cases of central serous retinopathy go away on their own as fluid naturally drains. But treatment may be necessary if the condition continues for several months. 
After the condition resolves, vision generally improves on its own, often returning to normal. But sometimes, damage can be permanent, with vision changes that don’t improve. 
The condition can happen again, even after successful treatment, in the same eye or your other eye. For this reason, you may need regular follow-up appointments with an ophthalmologist. 
Possible complications
When to see a doctor / red flag
When should I see my healthcare provider for vision changes? 
If you experience any changes to your vision, talk to your primary care provider or an ophthalmologist. 
Even though central serous chorioretinopathy can go away on its own, it can get worse and cause permanent vision changes or loss. And sometimes, vision problems are a sign of underlying disease.

CHALAZION
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Chalazion is also known as a “meibomian cyst”, “meibomian cyst”, “lipogranuloma”, or “conjunctival granuloma”.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
What is a chalazion?
Chalazion is a condition where the oil glands in the eyelid become blocked causing a lump910, which causes a red bump on your eyelid. It’s sometimes called an eyelid cyst or a meibomian cyst. It slowly forms when an oil gland (called a meibomian gland) becomes blocked. At first, the chalazion may be painful, but after a little time, it usually doesn’t hurt. A chalazion typically forms on the underside of your upper eyelid but may occasionally form on your lower eyelid.
Ordinarily, chalazia’s (the plural of chalazion) develop in adults between the ages of 30 and 50. They’re not common in children, but they can happen.
Is That Bump on Your Eye a Stye or a Chalazion?
Chalazion vs. stye — what’s the difference?
It can be hard to tell the difference between a chalazion and a stye. A chalazion can form because of a stye, but they’re different conditions. While they both form due to blocked oil glands, styes are bacterial infections that cause the gland to swell. Styes appear at your eyelid’s edge, whereas chalazia’s appear farther back on your eyelid. In addition, styes can be painful, but chalazia generally aren’t painful.
CAUSES
What causes a chalazion?
A chalazion develops when something blocks a small oil gland in your eyelid. These glands (meibomian glands) help keep your eyes moist. A blocked gland begins retaining oil and swells. Eventually, the fluid will drain, causing irritation to your surrounding eyelid skin. This irritation can lead to a hard lump filled with the oil and fluid on your eyelid.
Are chalazions contagious?
No, chalazia aren’t contagious. Bacterial infections don’t cause them, so bacteria can’t spread from person to person.
RISK FACTORS
What are the risk factors for developing a chalazion?
Chalazia are very common, and anyone can get them. But you may be more likely to get a chalazion if you:
Have had a chalazion before.
Have chronic blepharitis (eyelid inflammation).
Have certain skin conditions, like dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis) or rosacea.
Have dry skin.
Are experiencing hormonal changes.
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
What are the symptoms of a chalazion?
If you have a chalazion, you’ll notice a bump on your eyelid. It usually affects your upper lid. When a chalazion first develops, it may be painful, but the pain will quickly go away. As the chalazion grows, it may become red, swollen and tender.
Other chalazion symptoms may include:
Mild irritation, causing your eye to water.
Blurred vision from a larger chalazion pushing on your eyeball.
Entirely swollen eyelids.
DIAGNOSIS METHOD
How is a chalazion diagnosed?
You’ll usually see an eye care specialist when you have a chalazion. You might see an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. These healthcare providers can examine the chalazion and offer treatment options.
When you see an eye care specialist, you can expect:
Health history: Your provider will go over your complete health history. This information can help your provider find underlying issues that could be contributing to the formation of a chalazion.
External eye exam: Your provider will perform a complete eye exam, looking at your eye, eyelid, eyelashes and skin texture.
Thorough eyelid exam: Your provider will shine a bright light and use magnification to look at the base of your eyelashes. They’ll also check the oil glands’ openings on the underside of your eyelid.
TREATMENT OPTIONS
Management and Treatment
What is the best way to get rid of a chalazion?
In most cases, you can treat a chalazion at home. Most chalazion go away in a month or less.
First, never push on a chalazion or try to pop it. You can cause inflammation and infection. Instead, for chalazion self-care, try:
Warm compresses: Wet a clean washcloth with warm water. Hold it on the affected eye for 15 minutes. Do this at least three times a day to help the blocked oil gland open up.
Good hygiene: Don’t wear eye makeup while you have a chalazion. After the chalazion drains, keep the area clean. Follow good eye health practices, and avoid touching your eyes.
If the chalazion doesn’t go away, you should seek help from an eye care specialist. Chalazion treatment in your provider’s office may include draining the fluid through a small cut (incision). You may also need an injection of steroids to reduce swelling and inflammation.
PREVENTION TIPS
Can chalazion be prevented?
Some chalazia form because of styes. You may be able to avoid getting a chalazion if you can avoid getting a stye. You can avoid getting styes by following good hygiene. Some essential elements of good hygiene include:
Hand washing: Wash your hands thoroughly and often. Before you touch your eyes, make sure to wash your hands.
Contact lens care: Wash your hands before removing contact lenses. Make sure to thoroughly clean your contacts with a disinfectant and lens cleaning solution. Always throw daily and limited-time contacts away on schedule.
Face washing: Wash your face daily to remove dirt and makeup before going to bed. Your healthcare provider may recommend cleaning your eyelids with a special scrub or baby shampoo, especially if you’re prone to blepharitis.
Makeup hygiene: Throw away all of your old or expired makeup. Be sure to replace mascara and eye shadow every two to three months. Also, never share or use another person’s makeup.
OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
How many days does a chalazion last?
With proper home management, a chalazion should heal in a week. If left untreated, it can take four to six weeks for the chalazion to heal. Some can persist for many months.
Will I get more chalazia?
If you have one chalazion, you may get another. Always practice good hygiene to help prevent future chalazia.
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you have a chalazion that doesn’t go away with home treatment, see an eye care specialist. They’ll be able to examine your eye and offer additional treatment options. You should also see your healthcare provider if you have recurring chalazia (eyelid bumps that come back).
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
What are the complications of chalazion?
Larger chalazion can press on the surface of your eye (cornea), which can lead to blurred and decreased vision.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
United States and international statistics
Chalazia are common, but their exact incidence and prevalence in the United States are not known. Data about the worldwide prevalence or incidence of chalazia also are unavailable.
Age-related demographics
Although chalazion occurS in all age groups, they are more common in adults (especially those aged 30-50 years) than in children, presumably because androgenic hormones increase sebum viscosity. [2] Hormonal influences on sebaceous secretion and viscosity may explain clustering at the time of puberty and during pregnancy; however, the large number of patients without evidence of hormonal alteration suggests other mechanisms also apply. Chalazia are uncommon at the extremes of age, but pediatric cases may be encountered.
Recurrent chalazion, particularly in elderly patients, should prompt the practitioner to consider conditions that may masquerade as a chalazion (eg, sebaceous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, tuberculosis). Recurrent chalazion in a child or young adult should prompt an evaluation for viral conjunctivitis and hyperimmunoglobulinemia E (hyper-IgE) syndrome (Job syndrome).
Sex- and race-related demographics
Chalazia appear to affect males and females equally, but as noted, precise information about prevalence and incidence is not available. Contrary to popular opinion, research has not shown that the use of eyelid cosmetic products either causes or aggravates the condition.

CHOROIDEREMIA
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Choroideremia is also known as CHM, and sometimes referred to as “Tapetochoroidal dystrophy”.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
What is choroideremia?
Choroideremia (pronounced “kuh-roy-der-ee-me-ah”) is a rare inherited disease that affects your eyes. It causes vision to get worse and then leads to blindness. Severe disease mostly affects men.
Choroideremia is similar in some ways to retinitis pigmentosa, another condition that causes your retina to degrade. In fact, the two diseases have similar symptoms and sometimes have similar test results. Getting a genetic test is the best way to tell the difference between the two diseases.
In your eye, your retina has photoreceptor cells that capture light and turn it into electrical signals. Those signals travel along your optic nerve to your brain where they’re turned into images. The choroid is a layer between your retina and sclera, which is the white protective covering of your eye.
The choroid has blood vessels that feed your retina. Damage to your choroidal blood vessels leads to damage to your retina and peripheral sight.
How common is choroideremia?
Choroideremia affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 people
CAUSES
What causes choroideremia?
Choroideremia is an X-linked genetic disorder. The gene that causes choroideremia is located on your X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one.
Because there’s only one X chromosome with the faulty gene related to choroideremia, females don’t normally have the same vision problems that males with the faulty gene on their X chromosome have. Females may develop night blindness or glare issues later in life, but rarely go blind from choroideremia.
But males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. They’re more prone to developing X-linked genetic disorders. Affected males pass on their X chromosome to their female children, who become carriers. Those female children have a 1 in 2 chance (50%) of passing the faulty X chromosome to their female children.

 and risk factors
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
What are the signs and symptoms of choroideremia?
The signs and symptoms of choroideremia include:
Difficulty seeing at night (night blindness). This often happens before the age of 10.
Difficulty with peripheral (side) vision.
Lack of visual acuity (sharpness).
Loss of the ability to see colors well.
Increasing vision loss from the side that can progress to blindness.
DIAGNOSIS METHOD
How is choroideremia diagnosed?
It’s important to get regular eye exams, but an eye care provider will certainly examine your eyes if you report symptoms. They’ll likely do these tests, as well as others:
Electroretinogram: This test measures your retina’s response to light. A provider will place electroencephalogram disks on your face, eyes, head and scalp, and then place very thin wires over the front of your eye, directly above your bottom eyelid. The technician will flash bright lights in front of your eyes to measure your retina’s activity.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT): This type of test is a noninvasive imaging method that uses reflected light to create pictures of the back of your eye.
Fluorescein angiography: Angiography is a test that uses dye injected through your veins to show the blood vessels in your eye.
Genetic testing: A DNA test, or genetic testing, can identify mutations in your genes. A lab can use samples from your blood, hair, skin, tissue or amniotic fluid. Genetic testing can tell the difference between choroideremia and retinitis pigmentosa.
TREATMENT OPTIONS
Management and Treatment
How is choroideremia treated?
Providers can’t cure choroideremia. But you may receive treatment for other issues. For instance, as vision gets worse, you may find that you can use some strategies for coping with low vision. Coping tips range from devices like magnifiers to counseling for mental health and genetics.
PREVENTION TIPS
What can I expect if I have choroideremia?
Generally, people with choroideremia can expect their peripheral vision to get worse over time, leaving only central vision. Eventually, the condition may progress to blindness. There isn’t a cure.
OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
How do I take care of myself?
You can take care of yourself by following guidelines for a healthy life, including:
Eating a healthy diet that includes green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, fruit and lean protein. Avoid excess salt, sugar and unhealthy fats.
Getting enough physical activity.
Quitting smoking if you smoke.
Having regular eye exams.
Getting enough sleep.

Possible complications
WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You should see a healthcare provider whenever you have a change in vision. If any of the changes are sudden or painful, consider getting emergency care.
See a provider if you find you’re having difficulties with your daily activities. Ask for information on being eligible for gene therapy trials, too.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Choroideremia is a rare chorioretinal dystrophy that is estimated to affect between 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 individuals.[10] Men are predominantly affected due to its X-linked etiology, but women can be asymptomatic carriers or rarely can be affected by the dystrophy as well. Northern Finland has the highest reported prevalence.[11][12] There are thought to be more than 500 affected males in the United Kingdom and around 3000 throughout Europe.

COATS DISEASE
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
What is Coats disease?
Coats disease causes blood vessels in your child’s eye to develop incorrectly. Specifically, it affects blood vessels in their retina. Eventually, it makes the blood vessels swell and leak plasma into their retina. You might see it referred to as Coats’ syndrome or exudative retinitis.
The retina is the layer at the very back of your eyeball. It converts light that enters your eye into electrical signals your optic nerve sends to your brain, which creates the images you see.
Blood vessels are channels that carry blood throughout your body. They form a closed loop, like a circuit, that begins and ends at your heart.
Coats disease makes the tiny blood vessels in your child’s retina dilate (expand), twist and leak. The leak is usually small and takes time to cause symptoms you’ll notice — think about the difference between running over a nail and making your car’s tire lose air slowly and hitting a pothole and bursting it all at once.
Coats disease usually affects one eye (unilaterally), but it can develop in both eyes at the same time (bilateral Coats disease). It’s usually diagnosed in kids and teens but can develop at any age. It can make your child’s vision worse and lead to serious complications like a detached retina and blindness in their affected eye.
Talk to your healthcare provider or eye care specialist as soon as you notice any changes in your child’s eyes or vision.
Symptoms and Causes
What are Coats disease symptoms?
Your child might not have any symptoms of Coats disease, especially early on. If they do have symptoms, they might include:
Worsening vision.
Crossed eyes (strabismus).
Eye pain.
A white or silvery pupil (leukocoria).
Coats disease stages
Coats disease progresses (becomes more severe) in stages. They range from stage 1 (the mildest) to stage 5 (most severe):
Stage 1 Coats disease: Your eye care specialist notices abnormal blood vessels in your child’s eye, but they’re not causing any issues or symptoms.
Stage 2 Coats disease: The affected blood vessels in your child’s eye start leaking. This will probably affect your child’s vision.
Stage 3 Coats disease: Your eye care specialist will classify the Coats disease as stage 3 if it causes a detached retina in your child’s affected eye.
Stage 4 Coats disease: Stage 4 Coats disease causes glaucoma in your child’s eye.
Stage 5 Coats disease: This is sometimes called end-stage Coats disease. It causes blindness in the affected eye.
What causes Coats disease?
Experts aren’t sure what causes Coats disease. It usually happens without a specific cause (idiopathically).
Coats disease isn’t a genetic disorder. This means it’s not passed through generations of a family — it’s not hereditary.
Risk factors
Anyone can develop Coats disease. But boys are three times more likely to have it than girls.
Coats disease can develop at any age:
Providers usually diagnose kids and teens before they’re 16.
It’s rare, but babies can be born with Coats disease, and it can develop in some infants.
Around one-third of people with Coats disease are adults older than 30.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is Coats disease diagnosed?
An eye care specialist will diagnose Coats disease with an eye exam.
They’ll look at your child’s eyes (including inside them). They’ll examine your child’s eyes and vision with a visual acuity test.
Your eye care specialist might need one or a few imaging tests to diagnose Coats disease, including:
Optical coherence tomography (OCT).
Angiography.
Ultrasound.
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).
CT scan (computed tomography scan).
Management and Treatment
How is Coats disease treated?
How Coats disease is treated depends on which stage your child has. If an eye care specialist diagnoses them early (stage 1 or early in stage 2), your child may not need any treatment. Your eye care specialist will regularly check your child’s eyes for changes in their retina’s blood vessels.
If your child has more severe symptoms or is in a later stage, Coats disease treatments include:
Cryotherapy: Cryotherapy is a treatment where your healthcare provider applies extreme cold to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. They’ll freeze the affected blood vessels in your child’s retina to prevent them from leaking anymore.
Medication: An ophthalmologist can inject anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs into your child’s retina. This can stop their blood vessels from leaking and prevent a retinal detachment.
Surgery: If your child has later-stage Coats disease or has experienced a detached retina, they’ll need surgery to repair the damage.
Prevention
How can I prevent Coats disease?
Because it happens randomly with no cause, there’s nothing you can do to prevent Coats disease.
Visit your eye care specialist for follow-up eye exams to monitor any changes in your child’s retina after they’ve been diagnosed.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if my child has Coats disease?
How your child’s eye and vision will be affected by Coats disease depends on what stage it was diagnosed at, and how well their eye responds to treatment. Studies have found that the older kids are when they develop Coats disease, the less likely it is that they have severe cases that progress to later stages.
If Coats disease is diagnosed early in stages 1 or 2, there’s a good chance your child won’t have severe long-term effects. However, they might have reduced or low vision in their affected eye, even after treatment.
Later-stage Coats disease has a higher risk of blindness in the affected eye.
What are Coats disease complications?
While your child has Coats disease, they’ll have an increased risk for other conditions that can affect their eye, including:
Glaucoma.
Cataracts.
Uveitis.
Neovascularization (developing new, abnormal blood vessels).
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider?
See your healthcare provider or eye care specialist as soon as you notice any changes in your child’s eyes or vision.
Go to the emergency room if they have any of the following symptoms:
A sudden loss of vision.
Severe eye pain.
They see new flashes or floaters in their eyes.

Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)
dd
Diseases that produce leukocoria[66] and strabismus can simulate Coats disease.[66] The differential diagnosis includes retinoblastoma, FEVR, retinal detachment, Noorie disease, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), congenital cataract, retinal hemorrhage, hemangioblastoma, toxocariasis, choroidal hemangioma, coloboma, endophthalmitis, cytomegalovirus retinitis, and toxoplasmosis.[67][68][67] The most important differential is retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in children and is fatal if left untreated. Coats disease is the most common cause of erroneous enucleation reported.[2] 
Retinoblastoma can present in a younger child below one year; Coats disease is not as common in this age group and generally presents after 2 or 3 years. The large vessels in retinoblastoma go subretinally within the tumor, whereas in Coats disease, the telangiectatic vessels are always noted in the retinal surface. Bilaterality is common in retinoblastoma but very rare in Coats disease. Retinoblastoma often has a family history, but family history is usually not present in Coats disease. Retinoblastoma presents with leukocoria, and Coats disease has xanthocoria. On USG, retinoblastoma presents as a solid mass and calcification with shadowing. This feature is absent in Coats. The calcification in retinoblastoma is randomly distributed. Calcification in Coats is rare but, if present, is curvilinearly distributed along the retinal pigment epithelium.
FEVR and Noorie disease can be differentiated based on bilaterality, a positive family history, and the presence of retinal dragging, all of which are rare in Coats disease. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is seen in preterm low birth-weight babies. Proliferative retinopathy due to chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and pars planitis is another differential.
The classical finding in Coats is dilated telangiectatic vessels, aneurysms, hard exudates, peripheral avascularity, and exudative retinal detachment.
Sometimes a mass forms which might simulate
Melanoma,
Papillary or retinal capillary hemangioblastoma,
Choroidal granuloma (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis), and
Vasoproliferative tumor.
Other differential diagnoses of diseases with extensive hard exudates include
Branch retinal venous occlusion,
Vasoproliferative tumor,
Capillary hemangioma,
Chronic retinal detachment,
Trauma, and
Inflammation.
A Coats-like response (retinal telangiectasia, aneurysm, and hard exudates) may also be noted in
Retinitis pigmentosa[69]
Healed choroiditis[70]
Tubercular subretinal abscess[71]
Retinal vasculitis,[72]
Pars planitis[73][74][75]

Epidermal nevus syndrome
As described by Gass and Blodi, type I macular telangiectasia is characterized by nonfamilial and usually unilateral disease with retinal telangiectasia and hard exudates.[82] This disease is thought to lie in the spectrum of Coats disease.[83] The peripheral retinal yellow hard exudates in retinitis pigmentosa with a Coats-like response may be misdiagnosed as acute retinal necrosis.[84][85] Coats-like disease in FSHD is seen in around 75% of patients angiographically.[86] The retinal involvement is usually bilateral.[86] The posterior pole is usually not involved, and the disease usually has milder severity.[86] Visual loss is rarely (1%) noted.[86] Such bilateral Coats-like response in FSHD may affect females.[87]

Morris et al. conducted a population bases study of Coats disease.[21] The incidence was 0.09 per 100,000 population. All cases were unilateral, and 85% were male.[21] The mean age at presentation was 146 months (median 96 months). Some authors have reported that the disease could be present at birth.[22] In a large series, only 5% of cases were bilateral.[2] The fellow eye was usually without symptoms and had subtle peripheral telangiectatic changes.[2] Adult-onset Coats disease (first diagnosed at a minimum age of 35 years) constituted 7% of the 646 patients with Coats disease in a tertiary eye c
Color Blindness
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Difficulty distinguishing colors due to retinal cone cell dysfunction. Color blindness is an eye condition in which someone can't see the difference between certain colors. Though many people commonly use the term "color blind" for this condition, true color blindness — in which everything is seen in shades of black and white — is rare. The medical term for color blindness is known as color vision deficiency.
Color blindness is usually inherited, meaning it's passed down through families. Men are more likely to be born with color blindness. Most people with color blindness can't tell the difference between certain shades of red and green. Less commonly, people with color blindness can't tell the difference between shades of blue and yellow.
Certain eye diseases and some medicines also can cause color blindness.
Types of color blindness and what people can see
There are several types of color blindness, defined according to which types of cones aren’t working well. To understand the types of color blindness, it helps to know a bit about cones.
Cones are nerve cells in your eye that detect colors in the visible spectrum of light. This spectrum includes all the wavelengths that humans can see. These range in length from 380 nanometers (short), or nm, to 700 nanometers (long). Normally, you’re born with three types of cones:
Red-sensing cones (L cones): These cones perceive long wavelengths (around 560 nanometers).
Green-sensing cones (M cones): These cones perceive middle wavelengths (around 530 nanometers).
Blue-sensing cones (S cones): These cones perceive short wavelengths (around 420 nanometers).
Most people have all three types of cones, and these work as they should. However, if you have color vision deficiency, at least one type of cone isn’t working properly. Problems with your cones affect your ability to see colors in the traditional way. General categories that describe how many types of cones you have, and how well they’re working, include:
Trichromacy: All three types of cones are present and working properly. You see all colors on the visible spectrum of light in the traditional way. This is full-color vision.
Anomalous trichromacy: You have all three types of cones, but one type isn’t as sensitive to light in its wavelength as it should be. As a result, you don’t see colors in the traditional way, with variations from normal ranging from mild to severe. In mild cases, you may just confuse pale or muted colors. In more severe cases, you may also confuse vivid and pure (fully saturated) colors. These types of color blindness have names that end in “anomaly” (which indicates partial vision of a specific color).
Dichromacy: One type of cone is missing. So, you only have two types of cones (usually S cones along with either L cones or M cones). You see the world through the wavelengths that those two types of cones can perceive. It’s hard to tell the difference between fully saturated colors. These types of color blindness have names that end in “anopia” (which indicates absence of vision of a specific color).
Monochromacy: You only have one type of cone, or you have no cone function at all. You have very limited or no ability to see color. Instead, you see the world in varying shades of gray.
Within these general categories, there are many specific types of color blindness.
Red-green color deficiency
Red-green color deficiency is the most common type of color blindness. It affects how you see any colors or shades that have some red or green in them. There are four main subtypes:
Protanopia: Your L cones are missing. So, you can’t perceive red light. You mostly see colors as shades of blue or gold. You may easily confuse different shades of red with black. You may also confuse dark brown with dark shades of other colors, including green, red or orange.
Deuteranopia: Your M cones are missing. So, you can’t perceive green light. You mostly see blues and golds. You may confuse some shades of red with some shades of green. You may also confuse yellows with bright shades of green.
Protanomaly: You have all three cone types, but your L cones are less sensitive to red light than they should be. Red may appear as dark gray, and every color that contains red may be less bright.
Deuteranomaly: You have all three cone types, but your M cones are less sensitive to green light than they should be. You see mostly blues, yellows and generally muted colors.
Protanopia and deuteranopia are examples of dichromacy. Protanomaly and deuteranomaly are examples of anomalous trichromacy.
Other terms you might hear are “protan” and “deutan.” Protan and deutan are shorthand ways to talk about red-green colorblindness. Deutan refers to green (you have impaired or missing green-sensing cones, or M cones). Protan refers to red (you have impaired or missing red-sensing cones, or L cones).
Red-green color blindness is much more common among males. This is because the genes for the color vision cone light-sensitive proteins are on the X chromosome, of which males have one and females have two. So if the one X in a male contains abnormal genes, the color blindness will reveal itself, while females can compensate with the other normal gene on the second X chromosome.
Blue-yellow color deficiency
Blue-yellow color vision defects (tritan defects) are much less common and include:
Tritanopia: You have no S cones. So, you can’t perceive blue light. You see mostly reds, light blues, pinks and lavender.
Tritanomaly: You have all three cone types, but your S cones are less sensitive to blue light than they should be. Blues look green, and you see little or no yellow.
Blue-yellow color blindness equally affects males and females.
Blue cone monochromacy
This is the rarest form of color blindness. With this type, you don’t have working L cones or M cones. You only have S cones. It’s hard to tell the difference between colors, and you see mostly grays. You may also have other eye problems, including sensitivity to light (photophobia), nystagmus and nearsightedness.
Rod monochromacy (achromatopsia)
Achromatopsia is when all or most of your cones are missing or don’t work properly. You see everything in shades of gray. You also have other vision issues that may greatly impact your quality of life.
Who does color blindness affect?
Inherited color blindness mostly affects males. This is due to its genetic inheritance pattern (X-linked recessive). Conditions passed down in this manner are much more common among males.
People can also acquire color blindness due to certain medical conditions, medications or environmental exposures.
How common is color blindness?
Among people of Northern European ancestry, red-green color blindness affects about 1 in 12 males and 1 in 200 females. These numbers vary by ethnicity. Some research shows that Europeans have the highest prevalence of color blindness.
Here are some statistics about the less common forms of color blindness:
Blue-yellow color deficiency affects 1 in 10,000 people.
Achromatopsia affects 1 in 30,000 people.
Blue cone monochromacy affects 1 in 100,000 people.
Overall, around 300 million people around the world have some form of color blindness (mostly red-green).
CAUSES
Seeing colors across the light spectrum is a complex process that begins with your eyes' ability to respond to different wavelengths of light.
Light, which contains all color wavelengths, enters your eye through the cornea and passes through the lens and transparent, jellylike tissue in your eye (vitreous humor) to wavelength-sensitive cells (cones) at the back of your eye in the macular area of the retina. The cones are sensitive to short (blue), medium (green) or long (red) wavelengths of light. Chemicals in the cones trigger a reaction and send the wavelength information through your optic nerve to your brain.
If your eyes work as they should, you perceive color. But if your cones don't work properly, you will be unable to distinguish the colors red, green or blue.
RISK FACTOR
Several factors increase the risk of color blindness, including:
Gender. Colorblindness is much more common in males than in females.
Family history. Colorblindness is often inherited, meaning it is passed down through families. You can inherit a mild, moderate or severe degree of the condition. Inherited color deficiencies usually affect both eyes, and the severity doesn't change over your lifetime.
Diseases. Some conditions that can increase the risk of color deficiency include sickle cell anemia, diabetes, macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, Parkinson's disease, chronic alcoholism and leukemia. One eye may be more affected than the other, and the color deficiency may get better if the underlying disease can be treated.
Certain medicines. Some medicines can affect color vision, such as hydrochloroquine, a medicine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.
Damage to the eye. Color blindness can be caused by trauma to the eye as a result of injury, surgery, radiation therapy or laser treatment.
Signs and SYMPTOMS
You may have a color vision deficiency and not know it. Some people figure out that they or their child has the condition when it causes confusion — such as when there are problems differentiating the colors in a traffic light or interpreting color-coded learning materials.
People affected by color blindness may not be able to distinguish:
Different shades of red and green.
Different shades of blue and yellow.
Any colors.
The most common color deficiency is an inability to see some shades of red and green. Often, a person who is red-green or blue-yellow deficient isn't completely insensitive to both colors. Defects can be mild, moderate or severe.
DIAGNOSIS
If you have trouble seeing certain colors, an eye care professional can test for a color deficiency. Testing likely involves a thorough eye exam and looking at specially designed pictures. These pictures are made of colored dots that have numbers or shapes in a different color hidden in them.
If someone has a color vision deficiency, they'll find it difficult or impossible to see some of the patterns in the dots.
TREATMENT
There are no treatments for most types of color vision difficulties, unless the color vision problem is related to the use of certain medicines or eye conditions. Stopping the medicine causing the vision problem or treating the underlying eye disease may result in better color vision.
Wearing a colored filter over eyeglasses or a colored contact lens may enhance perception of contrast between the confused colors. But such lenses won't improve the ability to see all colors.
Potential future treatments
Some rare retinal disorders associated with color deficiency could possibly be modified with gene replacement techniques. These treatments are under study. One treatment was approved for a rare condition called Leber congenital amaurosis, a retina condition that is present at birth. More treatments might become available in the future.
Lifestyle and home remedies
Try the following tips to help you work around your color blindness.
Memorize the order of colored objects. If it's important to know individual colors, such as with traffic lights, memorize the order of the colors.
Label colored items that you want to match with other items. Have someone with good color vision help you sort and label your clothing. Arrange your clothes in your closet or drawers so that colors that can be worn together are near each other.
Use technology. There are apps for phones and tablets that can help you identify colors.
Prevention
You can’t prevent inherited color blindness. However, you may be able to lower your risk of acquired color blindness. Visit a healthcare provider for yearly checkups and ask about your risk for developing color vision deficiency. Some questions to ask include:
Do any of my medical conditions put me at risk for color blindness?
Can any of my medications cause color blindness?
Should I be concerned about any chemical or environmental exposures at my job?
What can I do to lower my risk?
Outlook / Prognosis
Color blindness might not affect your life much, especially if your condition is mild. More severe forms may interfere with your job, education or personal life. It’s important to talk to your eye care provider about your condition and what you can expect going forward. If your child has color blindness, ask what you can do to help them with school.
Can color blindness affect my child’s career choice?
Certain careers may be too challenging or unsafe to pursue with color deficiency. These include careers as an electrician, pilot, fashion designer or graphic artist. But you can encourage your child to pursue other careers where color vision won’t play a major role. Talk to counselors or mentors at your child’s school to access resources on career options.
Living With
How do I take care of myself or my child?
Connect with others who have color vision deficiency or parents of children with the condition. They can share advice and resources for living with color vision deficiency from day to day. Some tips include:
Find a color buddy who can help with shopping for items like clothes or paint.
Memorize the correct order of colors on things like traffic lights.
Download apps that help you identify colors in the world around you.

Possible complications
WHEN TO SEE THE DOCTOR
If you suspect you have problems distinguishing certain colors or your color vision changes, see an eye doctor for testing. It's important that children get comprehensive eye exams, including color vision testing, before starting school.
There's no cure for inherited color deficiencies, but if illness or eye disease is the cause, treatment may improve color vision.
Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)

Statistics
Color blindness is more common in white people.
Red-green color deficiency is the most common form, occurring in about 1 in 12 males and 1 in 200 females with Northern European ancestry.
Blue-yellow color vision deficiency is rarer and affects both males and females equally. This subtype presents in less than 1 in 10,000 people worldwide.
Complete color blindness only affects around 1 in 30,000 people.
One study found that 25% of people with anomalous trichromacy, in which one type of cone does not function correctly, were unaware that they had color vision deficiency.

COLOBOMA
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
A coloboma is an area of missing tissue in your eye. Colobomas are present in a person’s eye when they’re born. They can affect one or both eyes.
The most recognizable and common colobomas affect your iris (the colored part of your eye) and cause your pupil (the dark center of your eye) to have a keyhole shape. But there are many types of colobomas, most of which you can’t see externally (on the outside).
Some colobomas cause no symptoms, but others can have serious impacts on your child’s vision. What symptoms they’ll have depends on where in their eye the coloboma developed and which kind of tissue they’re missing.
Your healthcare provider might be able to diagnose a coloboma when your baby is born.
Who gets colobomas?
Anyone can be born with a coloboma.
They’re a type of genetic disorder, which means they’re passed from parents to their children. You might see coloboma referred to as a congenital condition.
However, even if one parent (or both) has a coloboma, that doesn’t mean your child will definitely develop one.
How common are colobomas?
Colobomas affect around 1 out of every 10,000 babies born each year.
Because not all colobomas cause noticeable symptoms, that number might be higher. Some people have an undiagnosed coloboma and never have symptoms or complications.
How does a coloboma affect my child’s body?
How much a coloboma affects your child depends on where in their eye it’s located. Colobomas can develop in one eye (unilateral coloboma) or both eyes (bilateral coloboma). Bilateral colobomas might affect different parts of your eyes.
Some colobomas won’t impact your child’s vision. Others cause total blindness in the affected eye. If your child has a coloboma on their retina, macula or optic nerve, they might have some vision, but it might be impaired.
You might not notice a coloboma affecting your child’s vision right away, especially while they’re very young.
People with colobomas might be more likely to have other issues with their eyes later in life, including:
·         Cataracts.
·         Glaucoma.
·         Retinal detachment.
Colobomas can develop in almost any part of your child’s eye, including their:
·         Iris.
·         Retina.
·         Optic nerve.
·         Macula.
·         Ciliary body.
·         Eyelid.
Coloboma of the iris
Colobomas of the iris are the most common type of coloboma. The iris is the colored part of your eye.
Babies born with a coloboma of the iris are sometimes referred to as having a congenital iris coloboma. Congenital is the medical term that means something is present at a person’s birth. Just like other types of colobomas, iris colobomas can be unilateral (only affecting one iris) or bilateral (affecting both irises). People with iris colobomas can also have other colobomas on their retina or optic nerve, too.
Colobomas of the iris are diagnosed and treated just like other types of colobomas. Some people with iris colobomas wear special contact lenses to help cover their pupils more completely. Surgery to change the appearance of an iris coloboma is an option, but not everyone is a good candidate for it. Talk to your provider or eye care specialist about which treatments will work for your child and when they should receive them.
What does an iris coloboma look like?
A coloboma of the iris can give your child’s pupil a keyhole or cat-eye shape. The shape depends on where in their iris it is and how much tissue is missing.
It might look like their pupil is “leaking” into the colored part of their eye. Nothing is in danger of falling out or moving around in your child’s eye. Both the iris and pupil are solid layers of tissue. The missing piece of your child’s iris is simply revealing more of the pupil under it that would usually be covered.
Does an iris coloboma affect vision?
A coloboma of the iris can affect your child’s vision.
Muscles in your iris control your pupil — the small black opening that lets light into your eye. Babies born with an iris coloboma are missing tissue in their iris. This can make it harder for their iris to control how wide (dilated) or narrow (contracted) their pupil is.
Depending on how big the coloboma is, it can cause symptoms that affect your child’s vision, including:
·         Light sensitivity (photophobia).
·         Blurry vision.
·         Double vision (diplopia).
·         “Ghost images,” blurry copies of an image you’re looking at or parts of an image that remain after you move your eyes.

Causes
What causes colobomas?
Experts think a genetic disorder that affects a fetus’s eye while its developing during pregnancy causes colobomas.
Around two months before a baby is born, what’s known as the optic fissure comes together to form their eyes. When the fissure doesn’t completely close, it causes colobomas in one or both of your baby’s eyes.
Genes are made of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which contain instructions for cell functioning and the characteristics that make you unique. Studies have shown links between certain genes in parents and the likelihood that their children will be born with a coloboma, but there isn’t enough evidence to say for sure which exact genes are responsible.
Certain external factors — like drinking alcohol during pregnancy — can increase the odds that your baby develops a coloboma.
 and risk factors
Signs and symptoms
If your child has symptoms from their coloboma, they can include:
·         Light sensitivity.
·         A keyhole or cat-eye-shaped pupil.
·         Low vision, blindness or partial vision loss.
·         Nystagmus.
A coloboma might only affect a portion of your child’s field of vision (the full range of how much they can see). Colobomas can cause:
·         Reduced peripheral vision.
·         Difficulty with depth perception.
·         A larger than usual blind spot.

Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Your provider or an ophthalmologist will diagnose a coloboma during your child’s eye exam. They’ll examine your child’s eye and look inside it to identify any missing tissue. Every person with a visible coloboma (one you can see on the outside) should have a dilated eye exam to check for other colobomas inside their eye.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
There isn’t a treatment to replace the missing tissue in your child’s eyes.
However, there are treatments that might improve their vision, including:
·         Wearing corrective lenses (glasses or contacts).
·         Wearing an eye patch to prevent a lazy eye (amblyopia).
·         Low vision aids (if their vision can’t be improved with corrective lenses).
Some people with iris colobomas can have surgery to change the appearance of their affected eye.
Prevention tips
Prevention
You can’t prevent genetic conditions like colobomas from developing during your pregnancy.
Colobomas — and other genetic conditions — are linked to certain environmental factors (things that happen to or around a person who is pregnant), including:
·         Drinking alcohol.
·         Smoking or using tobacco products.
·         Using recreational drugs.
Talk to your provider about what you should avoid eating, drinking or doing while you’re pregnant.
Outlook / Prognosis
How much a coloboma affects your child’s life depends on where it is in their eye. Many people with colobomas never have any symptoms and can live their whole lives without any complications. Other people’s vision is affected from birth.
Even if a coloboma impairs your child’s sight, it isn’t fatal and can’t spread.
Very rarely, a coloboma is a sign of what’s known as CHARGE syndrome — a genetic syndrome that can be life-threatening. Talk to your provider or ophthalmologist about your baby’s risk and what you and your child should expect as they grow and develop.
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider?
See your healthcare provider as soon as you notice any changes in your child’s eyes or vision.
Go to the emergency room if your child has any of the following symptoms:
·         A sudden loss of vision.
·         Severe eye pain.
·         Sees new flashes or floaters in their eyes.
What questions should I ask my doctor?
·         What type of coloboma does my child have?
·         How will this affect their vision?
·         What treatments are available?
·         Do they have a higher risk for other issues in their eyes?

Corneal disease and dystrophies/ ULCER
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
There are several common causes of corneal disease, including infections, trauma, allergies, and more.The cornea is the clear tissue at the front and center of the eye. Its transparency permits light to pass into the eye, through the pupil, lens, and onto the retina at the back of the eye. The three major corneal layers are the outer layer of the cornea or epithelial layer, the middle layer termed the stroma, and finally, a single layer of cells called the endothelium.
The curvature of the cornea plays an important role in focusing (refracting or bending) light. The normal cornea is smooth, clear, and tough. It helps protect the eye from infection and foreign material.
There are several common causes of corneal disease, including the following:
Infections
Bacterial, fungal, or viral keratitis, as well as parasitic diseases
Trauma
Abrasions or exposure to toxic chemicals
Dystrophies and degenerative corneal disorders
Fuchs' dystrophy, map-dot-fingerprint dystrophy, or lattice corneal dystrophy
Autoimmune disorders
Wegener's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus
Nutritional deficiencies
Vitamin A deficiency
Allergies
Vernal and atopic keratoconjunctivitis
Growths
Pterygium or benign or malignant cancerous growths on the eye's surface
Ectasia (thinning)
Keratoconus, or thinning of the cornea following refractive laser surgery
Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a rare but serious inflammatory reaction to a medication or an infection
The cornea can also be damaged secondarily by other common eye conditions such as tear film abnormalities (dry eye), eyelid disorders, glaucoma, and iridocorneal endothelial syndrome (ICE), which may be associated with glaucoma.
Causes and risk factors
What are the causes and risk factors of corneal disease?
The causes of corneal disease vary widely. The conditions listed above are due to hereditary (inherited) causes, infection, trauma, autoimmune disorders, nutritional deficiencies, allergy, secondary causes (other eye diseases that also affect the cornea), growths, and tumors among others.
What causes corneal ulcers?
Corneal ulcers can happen for many reasons, but they mainly break down into two categories: infectious and noninfectious.
Infectious causes
Infectious causes are conditions that you can catch from or spread to others. There are four subtypes of infectious causes:
Bacteria. The most common types of bacteria that infect the cornea are Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Many of these bacteria are present all around us but cause infections if the cornea has an injury.
Viruses. These include common viruses like Herpes simplex viruses (which cause cold sores or genital herpes) and varicella-zoster virus (which causes both chickenpox and shingles).
Fungi. These are most likely with eye injuries from plants or soil (like while gardening. The most common fungi that do this include Aspergillus and Candida. Fungal infections are also a more serious concern for people who are immunocompromised (their immune systems are suppressed). Their immune systems can’t fight off infections well, so those fungi can establish themselves more easily.
Parasites. Acanthamoeba family parasites are the most common cause of parasitic infection-related corneal ulcers. These parasites are a major risk for people who swim while wearing contacts. That applies to both bodies of water or pools because Acanthamoeba species can survive lower levels of chlorination (like in undertreated swimming pools). They can also live in tap water, which is why you should never use tap water to clean or store your contacts.
Noninfectious causes
These are conditions or circumstances that can cause corneal ulcers without an infection. Examples include:
Eye injuries. Burns, scratches (corneal abrasions), cuts (lacerations) and punctures can all lead to ulcers when they don’t heal correctly. They also make your eyes more vulnerable to infections, which can lead to corneal ulcers forming.
Exposure. If you can’t close your eyes fully (a condition called lagophthalmos), that leaves your corneas exposed for much longer than they should be. This can lead to corneal surface damage. Your corneas are also vulnerable to exposure damage in very hot or cold conditions.
Very dry eyes. This can be because of weather conditions, eye conditions or a combination of the two.
Toxic effects. These can be from toxic substances or, more rarely, from medications you’re taking.
Immune conditions. Sometimes, eye inflammation happens because your immune system malfunctions. That inflammation can weaken your corneal tissue, making it vulnerable to damage and ulcer formation.
Risk factors similarly vary depending on the individual's circumstances. Some risk factors are not modifiable, such as inherited genetic conditions. Others might be avoidable by limiting exposure to trauma and infection. In many people, prompt treatment of corneal disease in its early stages will minimize the severity of the disease and its complications.
What are the risk factors for this condition?
Anyone can get corneal ulcers, but you have a higher risk if you have:
Contact lenses that you wear often or for long periods (especially if you sleep or swim with them still in, or don’t maintain them properly).
A current or past herpes simplex virus infection or varicella-zoster virus infection.
Dry eyes.
Conditions that make it harder or impossible to fully close your eyes (including different types of facial paralysis like Bell’s palsy, or conditions that make your eyes bulge, like Graves’ disease).
Steroid-containing medicated eye drops that you’re currently using or recently used.
An injury or burn on your cornea.
Type 2 diabetes.
A history of eye surgery.
A history of other eye diseases, especially corneal diseases.
Signs and symptoms
What are the signs and symptoms of corneal disease?
Signs of corneal problems can include redness around the cornea and/or corneal cloudiness.
Symptoms include the following:
visual impairment, such as blurred or cloudy vision,
severe pain in the eye,
tearing, and
sensitivity to light.
Some patients have additional symptoms of headache, nausea, and fatigue.
Symptoms of a corneal ulcer include:
pain,
intense redness,
feeling as if the eye is scratched or something is in the eye,
sensitivity to light, and
blurry vision.
Blurred vision may be the result of an irregular tear layer or epithelial layer (as seen in the dry eye), scarring (following trauma or infection), cataracts, deformity of the corneal curvature (as seen in keratoconus), or swelling of the cornea (as seen in Fuchs' dystrophy). Pain and light sensitivity can be quite severe, especially in conditions affecting the outermost layer (epithelium) of the cornea. Examples include traumatic abrasions, infectious ulcers, and erosions from dryness.
If you suspect a corneal ulcer or have the symptoms of a corneal ulcer and wear contact lenses, see your ophthalmologist immediately. High potency antibiotics and pain medications are the treatments for this condition.
Corneal ulcer symptoms vary widely. The most common ones include:
Red or bloodshot eyes.
Teary or watery eyes (epiphora).
Eye pain (can vary from mild discomfort or aching to severe pain).
Feeling like something’s stuck in your eye, like a hair or dust (foreign object sensation).
Light sensitivity (photophobia).
Blurred vision.
Inflamed or swollen eyelids (blepharitis).
A white or gray spot on your cornea (these aren’t always visible, and even when they are, they can be hard to see without the right tools).
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
To diagnose a corneal ulcer, an eye specialist or another healthcare provider will rely mainly on an eye exam. Unlike a routine exam that checks all parts of your eye health, these exams will be more issue-specific. A key part of the eye exam that they’ll use is the slit lamp exam. It lets your eye specialist get an up-close, detailed look at your corneas.
One particular lab test your provider might do is a swab culture. That involves taking a soft-tipped swab, collecting some of the discharge from your eye and then sending that to a lab for testing. The test results may tell your provider what kind of infection is causing your ulcer. In cases that aren’t responsive to treatment, your provider may recommend taking this a step further and doing a corneal biopsy. That involves taking a sample of your corneal tissue for testing.
Your eye specialist can tell you more about any other tests they recommend. They can also explain how the tests work, why they should help and any side effects you should expect after the tests.

How do healthcare professionals diagnose corneal disease?
An eye doctor will review the person's medical history and perform a careful examination of the eyes and eyelids. The cornea is examined in detail using a slit lamp microscope.
Additional medical testing that can provide the information needed to make a diagnosis may include:
Topography and keratometry (to study the shape of the cornea)
Pachymetry (to measure the thickness of the cornea)
Specialized microscopy (providing detailed pictures to assess the health of the endothelial cells, or to identify infectious agents)
Assessment of the tear film
In some individuals, cultures, biopsies, or blood tests are also necessary.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
Corneal ulcers can happen for many reasons, which means there are many ways to treat them. Some treatments are very specific and only work for certain conditions. Other treatments are more general, helping the symptoms that are most likely with corneal ulcers.
Some of the more common treatment options include:
Medications. These can include antibiotics for bacterial infection-related ulcers or other similar approaches for viruses, fungi and parasites. Other medications, like corticosteroids, are more general and treat symptoms of corneal ulcers. Your provider may also recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil® or Motrin®). Your eye specialist can tell you about the medications, the form they come in and more.
Scleral lenses or bandage contact lenses. These are wearable items that help protect your eyes from further damage, giving your corneas time to heal.
Tarsorrhaphy. This treatment involves keeping your eye shut for longer periods. To do that, your provider can physically suture your eye closed, or they can use medications like onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®) to temporarily paralyze the muscles that control your eyelids. Keeping your eye shut gives your cornea a more ideal environment for healing.
Surgery. In cases where corneal ulcers aren’t healing, you may need surgery. In more severe cases, a corneal transplant might be necessary.
Other treatments may be possible or necessary, depending on your specific circumstances. Your eye specialist is the best source of information about the treatment options available for your specific case. They can also tell you more about the possible side effects or complications from treatment.
What is the treatment for corneal disease?
Treatment is tailored to the individual disease and the individual patient. Treatments might include medications, laser treatment, or surgery, depending on the condition.
Infections are treated with medicated eye drops (antibiotics, antivirals, and antiparasitics) and, in some cases, oral medication. Herpetic stromal keratitis is a recurring swelling that develops after a herpes eye infection and is managed with anti-inflammatory steroid eye drops.
An abrasion might require temporary patching or a bandage contact lens, depending on the cause and extent of the injury.
Keratoconus, in which the cornea can take on a distorted cone shape, is often managed with special contact lenses. Newer treatments, including corneal crosslinking (riboflavin and ultraviolet-A) and corneal implants, are also options. Advanced keratoconus diseases are treated with anterior lamellar keratoplasty for corneal transplant surgery.
Chronic swelling from Fuchs' dystrophy or other conditions that damage the cornea's endothelial cells is managed initially with salty eye drops or ointments that help prevent the accumulation of fluid within the cornea. If the condition worsens, an endothelial lamellar keratoplasty (a type of partial-thickness transplant surgery) may be indicated.
Research is underway to develop an artificial cornea for transplantation.
Autoimmune disorders are best treated by addressing the underlying disease. Corneal involvement is often managed with anti-inflammatory eye drops such as steroids; however, steroid-sparing immune-modulating medications are sometimes preferable, particularly when other parts of the body are also involved.
Eye problems caused by vitamin A deficiency, which can be seen in patients who have had certain types of bariatric (weight loss) surgery, can be corrected with supplements.
Allergic eye disease responds well to both topical and oral allergy medication.
A pterygium is a growth on the cornea's surface; this is most commonly seen after chronic sun exposure. They can be removed surgically if they become bothersome. Cancers of the surface of the eye are managed with surgery or in some cases, topical chemotherapy eye drops or injections.
A dry eye is common and can result in painful erosions of the corneal surface. Aside from lubricating the eyes with artificial tears, addressing the underlying cause is important. In some individuals, dryness is due to a lack of tear production, and anti-inflammatory drops such as cyclosporine (Restasis) or steroids may help. In other cases, the dryness is due to the evaporation of the tears between blinks. This occurs when the eyelids' oil glands (Meibomian glands) are not functioning well. Normally, the oil from these glands coats the eye's surface and prevents tear evaporation. The oil glands' function can be improved with a combination of warm compresses, lid hygiene (for example, dilute baby shampoo lid scrubs), increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids, and in some patients, oral medication.
Prevention tips
Is it possible to prevent corneal disease?
Many corneal diseases are preventable by reducing risk factors. For example, maintaining optimal eye health (with good hygiene and regular vaccinations) is the best prevention against many infectious diseases. There are vaccines available to reduce the severity and frequency of shingles, which can result in an eye herpes infection called herpes zoster ophthalmicus.
Contact lens wear can make individuals especially susceptible to serious corneal infections, so people should clean contact lenses as directed. Glasses and sunglasses with 100% ultraviolet block can protect against growths that are associated with sun exposure, such as pterygium, and eye surface cancers. Safety glasses should be worn when warranted to prevent trauma. A diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and sufficient vitamin A may help maintain a healthy tear film, thus minimizing dry eye symptoms.
Reviewing one's family's ocular health history helps look for hereditary conditions. Regular eye examinations are important for detecting eye diseases at their earliest stages.
A corneal ulcer is a common eye condition. It refers to a small crater (ulcer) on the front part of the eye, usually following an infection. Bacteria, viruses, or fungus can cause a corneal ulcer.
People who wear contact lenses are at higher risk for corneal ulcers. That’s because infectious agents may get trapped behind a lens. People deficient in vitamin A are particularly vulnerable to corneal ulcers.
Corneal ulcers aren’t 100% preventable, but there are many things you can do to lower your odds of developing them. Some things you can do include:
Don’t sleep in contact lenses. Sleeping in contact lenses is the most common cause of serious corneal ulcers.
Don’t wear contact lenses beyond their lifespan. The longer you use soft contact lenses, the more likely they are to grow bacteria. Daily contact lenses are the safest.
Wash or sanitize your hands frequently. Use soap and water if your hands look or feel dirty. If they don’t look or feel dirty, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol).
Use eye protection. Protecting your eyes from injury is a key way to avoid injury-related ulcers. Make sure you use the right protection for your eyes, too.
Never share things that touch your eyes. This goes for any items that touch areas of your face around your eyes. Some common examples include makeup or hygiene items like washcloths or towels. It also includes items for storing things that touch your eyes, like contact lens cases.
Prognosis
Outlook / Prognosis
Corneal ulcers can vary widely depending on what causes them. That includes how long they take to heal or how well they should heal. Your eye specialist can tell you more about what you can expect with your specific case.
Some key factors that can impact your outlook are:
Size. Larger ulcers usually have a less favorable outlook.
Cause. Some causes are very difficult to treat or recover from.
Location. Where an ulcer happens on your cornea can affect the outcome.
Response to treatment. The outlook is usually better when ulcers respond well to treatment.
How long do corneal ulcers take to heal?
The healing time for corneal ulcers can vary widely, and many factors play a role in this. Your eye specialist is the best person to tell you the likely time frame for your case, as they can tailor the estimate to the details of your situation.
Living With
If you have a corneal ulcer, the most important things you can do include:
Follow your provider’s instructions on treatment closely. That goes for medications, how you use or protect your eye, etc.
See your provider as recommended. Follow-up visits let your provider monitor an ulcer’s healing and adjust treatment if necessary.
Call your eye specialist if you have questions. That includes if you have any new symptoms, questions about how to take medications or treatments, or if you notice treatments aren’t effective. You should also talk to your specialist if any side effects from treatment are causing issues. They may have ways to reduce the impact of symptoms or adjust your treatment to stop side effects from happening.
Possible complications
What are the potential complications of corneal disease?
Many corneal diseases are treatable and have a good prognosis. However, vision loss and chronic eye pain are potential complications of corneal disease so it is important to review treatment options carefully with an eye doctor.
What are the complications of corneal ulcers?
Corneal ulcers can cause the following complications:
Astigmatism or other vision changes.
Cataracts.
Endophthalmitis.
Glaucoma.
Perforated or scarred cornea.
Recurrent corneal erosions (RCEs).
Vision loss.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Eye trauma accounts for about 3% of all emergency department visits, with approximately 80% of these visits for corneal abrasions or foreign bodies.  The incidence of corneal abrasion is higher among people of working age, with automotive workers between the ages of 20 and 29 years having the highest incidence of eye injuries.
Ocular chemical burns are an emergency, accounting for 11.5%–22.1% of all ocular injuries. Haring et al found that young children in the U.S. were the highest-risk individual group for ocular chemical burns, with ages 1 to 2 years at greatest risk. Generally, ocular chemical injuries occurred in individuals aged 18 to 64 years of age, making up the second most common cause of workplace ocular injuries after foreign bodies in the eye. Unfortunately, in recent years assault and hate crimes have contributed to an increased incidence of chemical injury, including up to 33% of severe ocular burns injuries.

CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) RETINITIS
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is a serious eye infection. It often happens in people with immune systems that don’t work as well as they should. The term “retinitis” means inflammation of your retina, which is the part of your eye that senses light.
CMV is a necrotizing virus, meaning that the virus destroys tissue. It’s part of the herpes family of viruses. Most people get CMV at some point in their lives and don’t even know it. But the virus can reactivate in people with weakened (compromised) systems, sometimes causing CMV retinitis.
This includes people who:
Have HIV/AIDS.
Are receiving chemotherapy.
Take immunosuppressant medications because they’ve had an organ transplant, bone marrow transplant or have autoimmune conditions.
CMV retinitis can result in long-term vision loss. In fact, it’s the main cause of blindness among people with HIV/AIDS.
Causes
What causes cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis?
If you’re infected with CMV, the virus can affect your retina, causing CMV retinitis. In adults with weakened immune systems, this is usually a reactivation of the virus rather than a new virus.
 and risk factors
Signs and symptoms
What are the signs and symptoms of cytomegalovirus retinitis?
You may not have symptoms of CMV retinitis right away. When you do develop them, symptoms may include:
Floaters in your eye.
Blind spots that move (scintillating scotoma).
Decreased side vision (peripheral vision).
Seeing wavy images (metamorphopsia).
Blurred vision.
Sensitivity to light (photophobia).
Red eye.
Eye pain.
The symptoms may start in one eye and then go on to your other eye.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
How is cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis diagnosed?
An ophthalmologist, or another type of eye care provider, will talk to you and ask you about your medical history and symptoms. Then they’ll do an eye examination after dilating your eyes.
Dilated pupils open widely, making it easier to see inside your eyes. Your provider will examine your retinas and other areas of your eyes for signs of disease. If you have retinitis, your provider may order lab work to identify its cause.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
How is cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis treated?
Antiviral medicines can treat CMV retinitis, but they can’t cure it.
Your provider may decide to give you one — or a combination — of the following antiviral medications:
Valganciclovir, given orally.
Ganciclovir, given intravenously (IV) or as an intravitreal injection (IVI, or a shot into your eye).
Foscarnet, given as an IV or IVI.
Cidofovir, given as an IV or IVI.
Letermovir, given orally.
Fomiversen.
Treatment takes weeks because there’s an initial period of therapy followed by maintenance therapy.
Prevention tips
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have CMV retinitis?
The best prognosis (outlook) happens with prompt treatment. Untreated CMV retinitis can lead to low vision, even to the point of blindness.
Another condition that may happen as a result of CMV retinitis is retinal detachment, which means that your retina tears away from its supporting tissue. You can have surgery to repair this serious condition.
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider?
If you have any sudden changes in eyesight — like dark spots in your vision or pain — get immediate medical help. Retinal detachment is a medical emergency.
It’s important to have regular eye exams if you have a weakened immune system.
What questions should I ask my healthcare provider about CMV retinitis?
You may want to ask your provider some questions about CMV retinitis, including:
How often should I schedule appointments?
Is there anything I should avoid?
How long will treatment last?
When should I call you or go to an emergency room?
Can you provide resources to help me cope with vision loss?
Am I eligible for clinical trials?
Complications of CMV retinitis treatment
Antiviral treatment of CMV retinitis may cause your immune system to have a strong response, which can lead to uveitis. Uveitis causes eyes to be red, swollen and painful.
Sometimes, the drugs that treat CMV retinitis stop working for you. There are treatments that may help with ganciclovir-resistant CMV retinitis. These include leflunomide and T-lymphocyte infusion.
When to see a doctor / red flag
Differential diagnosis
Early CMV can resemble cotton wool spots. It may be confused with HIV retinopathy, which is actually more common than CMV retinitis. HIV retinopathy occurs in 50-70% of patients and is characterized by intraretinal hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and microaneurysms. For small lesions that are hard to differentiate from cotton wool spots, serial exams should be performed, which will show enlargement of the CMV lesions. Immunosuppression should be treated like a spectrum; some patients are more immunosuppressed than other individuals. For cases of minor immunosuppression, CMV retinitis may present as acute retinal necrosis (ARN) syndrome but follows a chronic course similar to CMV retinitis, which may cause misdiagnosis.
Syphilitic hemorrhagic necrotizing retinitis can mimic CMV retinitis; all patients should undergo treponemal testing.
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
Epidemiology
The incidence of IRU varies and is influenced by factors such as the HAART era and immune status at the time of initiation. Early reports estimated that IRU occurred in 10-17% of CMV retinitis (CMVR) cases during the initial HAART era, with over half of the cases developing inflammation after only a modest increase in CD4+ T-cell count (100–150 cells/mm³).
The timing of HAART initiation in CMVR is critical. Starting HAART before completing CMV induction therapy increases the risk of IRU. Conversely, controlling CMVR prior to immune reconstitution significantly reduces both the occurrence and severity of IRU. Ongoing anti-CMV therapy is advised to suppress viral antigen load until adequate immune recovery is achieved.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis: Symptoms & Causes

Diabetic retinopathy
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Diabetic Retinopathy occurs when there is damage to the blood vessels of the retina caused by diabetes, leading to progressive vision loss and also one of the leading causes of blindness in American adults. Regular eye exams are crucial for early detection and treatment .15 
Diabetic retinopathy (die-uh-BET-ik ret-ih-NOP-uh-thee) is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).
At first, diabetic retinopathy might cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems. But it can lead to blindness.
The condition can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The longer you have diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop this eye complication.
CAUSES
Over time, too much sugar in your blood can lead to the blockage of the tiny blood vessels that nourish the retina, cutting off its blood supply. As a result, the eye attempts to grow new blood vessels. But these new blood vessels don't develop properly and can leak easily.
There are two types of diabetic retinopathy:
Early diabetic retinopathy. In this more common form — called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) — new blood vessels aren't growing (proliferating).
When you have NPDR, the walls of the blood vessels in your retina weaken. Tiny bulges protrude from the walls of the smaller vessels, sometimes leaking fluid and blood into the retina. Larger retinal vessels can begin to dilate and become irregular in diameter as well. NPDR can progress from mild to severe as more blood vessels become blocked.
Sometimes retinal blood vessel damage leads to a buildup of fluid (edema) in the center portion (macula) of the retina. If macular edema decreases vision, treatment is required to prevent permanent vision loss.
Advanced diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy can progress to this more severe type, known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this type, damaged blood vessels close off, causing the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina. These new blood vessels are fragile and can leak into the clear, jellylike substance that fills the center of your eye (vitreous).
Eventually, scar tissue from the growth of new blood vessels can cause the retina to detach from the back of your eye. If the new blood vessels interfere with the normal flow of fluid out of the eye, pressure can build in the eyeball. This buildup can damage the nerve that carries images from your eye to your brain (optic nerve), resulting in glaucoma.
RISK FACTOR
Anyone who has diabetes can develop diabetic retinopathy. The risk of developing the eye condition can increase as a result of:
Having diabetes for a long time
Poor control of your blood sugar level
High blood pressure
High cholesterol
Pregnancy
Tobacco use
Being Black, Hispanic or Native American
Signs and symptoms
SYMPTOMS
You might not have symptoms in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. As the condition progresses, you might develop:
Spots or dark strings floating in your vision (floaters)
Blurred vision
Fluctuating vision
Dark or empty areas in your vision
Vision loss
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
DIAGNOSIS
Diabetic retinopathy is best diagnosed with a comprehensive dilated eye exam. For this exam, drops placed in your eyes widen (dilate) your pupils to allow your doctor a better view inside your eyes. The drops can cause your close vision to blur until they wear off, several hours later.
During the exam, your eye doctor will look for abnormalities in the inside and outside parts of your eyes.
Fluorescein angiography
After your eyes are dilated, a dye is injected into a vein in your arm. Then pictures are taken as the dye circulates through your eyes' blood vessels. The images can pinpoint blood vessels that are closed, broken or leaking.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
With this test, pictures provide cross-sectional images of the retina that show the thickness of the retina. This will help determine how much fluid, if any, has leaked into retinal tissue. Later, OCT exams can be used to monitor how treatment is working.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
TREATMENT
Treatment, which depends largely on the type of diabetic retinopathy you have and how severe it is, is geared to slowing or stopping the progression.
Early diabetic retinopathy
If you have mild or moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, you might not need treatment right away. However, your eye doctor will closely monitor your eyes to determine when you might need treatment.
Work with your diabetes doctor (endocrinologist) to determine if there are ways to improve your diabetes management. When diabetic retinopathy is mild or moderate, good blood sugar control can usually slow the progression.
Advanced diabetic retinopathy
If you have proliferative diabetic retinopathy or macular edema, you'll need prompt treatment. Depending on the specific problems with your retina, options might include:
Injecting medications into the eye. These medications, called vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, are injected into the vitreous of the eye. They help stop growth of new blood vessels and decrease fluid buildup.
Three drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of diabetic macular edema — faricimab-svoa (Vabysmo), ranibizumab (Lucentis) and aflibercept (Eylea). A fourth drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), can be used off-label for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.
These drugs are injected using topical anesthesia. The injections can cause mild discomfort, such as burning, tearing or pain, for 24 hours after the injection. Possible side effects include a buildup of pressure in the eye and infection.
These injections will need to be repeated. In some cases, the medication is used with photocoagulation.
Photocoagulation. This laser treatment, also known as focal laser treatment, can stop or slow the leakage of blood and fluid in the eye. During the procedure, leaks from abnormal blood vessels are treated with laser burns.
Focal laser treatment is usually done in your doctor's office or eye clinic in a single session. If you had blurred vision from macular edema before surgery, the treatment might not return your vision to normal, but it's likely to reduce the chance of the macular edema worsening.
Panretinal photocoagulation. This laser treatment, also known as scatter laser treatment, can shrink the abnormal blood vessels. During the procedure, the areas of the retina away from the macula are treated with scattered laser burns. The burns cause the abnormal new blood vessels to shrink and scar.
It's usually done in your doctor's office or eye clinic in two or more sessions. Your vision will be blurry for about a day after the procedure. Some loss of peripheral vision or night vision after the procedure is possible.
Vitrectomy. This procedure uses a tiny incision in your eye to remove blood from the middle of the eye (vitreous) as well as scar tissue that's tugging on the retina. It's done in a surgery center or hospital using local or general anesthesia.
While treatment can slow or stop the progression of diabetic retinopathy, it's not a cure. Because diabetes is a lifelong condition, future retinal damage and vision loss are still possible.
Even after treatment for diabetic retinopathy, you'll need regular eye exams. At some point, you might need additional treatment.
Prevention tips
PREVENTION
You can't always prevent diabetic retinopathy. However, regular eye exams, good control of your blood sugar and blood pressure, and early intervention for vision problems can help prevent severe vision loss.
If you have diabetes, reduce your risk of getting diabetic retinopathy by doing the following:
Manage your diabetes. Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine. Try to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as walking, each week. Take oral diabetes medications or insulin as directed.
Monitor your blood sugar level. You might need to check and record your blood sugar level several times a day — or more frequently if you're ill or under stress. Ask your doctor how often you need to test your blood sugar.
Ask your doctor about a glycosylated hemoglobin test. The glycosylated hemoglobin test, or hemoglobin A1C test, reflects your average blood sugar level for the two- to three-month period before the test. For most people with diabetes, the A1C goal is to be under 7%.
Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control. Eating healthy foods, exercising regularly and losing excess weight can help. Sometimes medication is needed, too.
If you smoke or use other types of tobacco, ask your doctor to help you quit. Smoking increases your risk of various diabetes complications, including diabetic retinopathy.
Pay attention to vision changes. Contact your eye doctor right away if your vision suddenly changes or becomes blurry, spotty or hazy.
Remember, diabetes doesn't necessarily lead to vision loss. Taking an active role in diabetes management can go a long way toward preventing complications.

ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
Several alternative therapies have suggested some benefits for people with diabetic retinopathy, but more research is needed to understand whether these treatments are effective and safe.
Let your doctor know if you take herbs or supplements. They can interact with other medications or cause complications in surgery, such as excessive bleeding.
It's vital not to delay standard treatments to try unproven therapies. Early treatment is the best way to prevent vision loss.
PROGNOSIS
The prognosis of diabetic retinopathy depends on the duration of diabetes, glycemic control, associated comorbid conditions, and patient compliance to the appropriate line of treatment. Proper patient counseling is needed about their retinal condition and making patients aware that delay in proper follow-up could lead to permanent, irreversible vision loss. The initial stages of diabetic retinopathy are reversible if proper glycemic control is achieved. Many patients with diabetic macular edema require long-term support of repeated injections of intravitreal anti-VEGF medications. Patients treated with pan-retinal photocoagulation may require additional supplementation of anti-VEGF medications if there is persistent macular edema and neovascularization. Once there is tractional macular detachment for a longer duration, the visual prognosis is usually guarded as the macular anatomy is markedly distorted.
OCT biomarkers of prognosis of diabetic retinopathy include refractile bodies, disorganization of inner layers of the retina (DRIL), disruption of outer layers of the retina (DORL), choroidal thickness, epiretinal membrane, vitreomacular adhesions, subretinal fluid, macular thickness, and integrity of ellipsoid zone
Possible complications
COMPLICATIONS
Diabetic retinopathy involves the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina. Complications can lead to serious vision problems:
Vitreous hemorrhage. The new blood vessels may bleed into the clear, jellylike substance that fills the center of your eye. If the amount of bleeding is small, you might see only a few dark spots (floaters). In more-severe cases, blood can fill the vitreous cavity and completely block your vision.
Vitreous hemorrhage by itself usually doesn't cause permanent vision loss. The blood often clears from the eye within a few weeks or months. Unless your retina is damaged, your vision will likely return to its previous clarity.
Retinal detachment. The abnormal blood vessels associated with diabetic retinopathy stimulate the growth of scar tissue, which can pull the retina away from the back of the eye. This can cause spots floating in your vision, flashes of light or severe vision loss.
Glaucoma. New blood vessels can grow in the front part of your eye (iris) and interfere with the normal flow of fluid out of the eye, causing pressure in the eye to build. This pressure can damage the nerve that carries images from your eye to your brain (optic nerve).
Blindness. Diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, glaucoma or a combination of these conditions can lead to complete vision loss, especially if the conditions are poorly managed.

When to see a doctor / red flag
When to see an eye doctor
Careful management of your diabetes is the best way to prevent vision loss. If you have diabetes, see your eye doctor for a yearly eye exam with dilation — even if your vision seems fine.
Developing diabetes when pregnant (gestational diabetes) or having diabetes before becoming pregnant can increase your risk of diabetic retinopathy. If you're pregnant, your eye doctor might recommend additional eye exams throughout your pregnancy.
Contact your eye doctor right away if your vision changes suddenly or becomes blurry, spotty or hazy.

DUANE SYNDROME
ALTERNATIVE NAMES:
Are there other names for Duane syndrome?
Yes, there are several names for Duane syndrome. They include:
Duane retraction syndrome.
Eye retraction syndrome.
Retraction syndrome or congenital retraction syndrome.
Duane radial ray syndrome.
Stilling-Turk-Duane syndrome.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
What is Duane syndrome?
Duane syndrome is a type of strabismus, an eye misalignment that’s congenital (something you’re born with). If you have Duane syndrome, you’ll have difficulties moving your eyes from side to side. You may have trouble with one or both eyes looking inward toward your nose or outward toward your ear.
You may also have trouble looking upward or downward. Along with your eyes crossing, or being out of alignment with each other, your eyelids might move when you try to move your eyes. This is because the nerves that control the muscles in your eyes don’t work correctly.
About 80% to 90% of Duane syndrome cases are unilateral, which means they affect only one eye. The left eye is more commonly affected.
TYPES OF DUANE’S SYNDROME
Are there different types of Duane syndrome?
Yes, there are different types of Duane syndrome: type 1, type 2 and type 3.
Type 1 Duane syndrome
Duane syndrome type 1 is the most common form. It accounts for about 78% of all cases.
If you have type 1, you’ll have trouble moving your eye outward toward your ear. Your eye will be able to cross inward toward your nose, but your eye opening typically becomes smaller and the eyeball retracts. Your eye may look crossed in toward your nose (esotropia).
Type 2 Duane syndrome
Duane syndrome type 2 is the least common form. It accounts for about 7% of people with the condition.
If you have type 2, you have a limited ability to move your eyes inward toward your nose. You will be able to turn your eye outward toward your ear but your eye opening typically becomes smaller and the eyeball retracts. Your eye may look turned out toward your ear (exotropia).
Type 3 Duane syndrome
Duane syndrome type 3 accounts for about 15% of total cases.
If you have type 3, your ability to move your eyes in either direction is limited. Also, your eye opening may become smaller and your eyeball retracts with certain gazes.
How common is Duane syndrome?
It’s estimated that 4% of the population of the U.S., or some 13 million people, have strabismus. It’s further estimated that about 1% to 5% of the total number of people with strabismus have Duane syndrome.
Duane syndrome is slightly more common in females.
CAUSES
What causes Duane syndrome?
Duane syndrome is genetic, but not typically inherited. The movement issues are due to problems with your cranial nerves, or the nerves that control the way your eyes move.
Duane syndrome may happen more frequently in people who’ve been exposed to thalidomide in utero.
Only about 10% of people with Duane syndrome have other family members with the condition. In cases that run in the family, Duane syndrome is usually bilateral (it affects both eyes).
If you inherit Duane syndrome, it happens because a variant of CHN1, MAFB, or SALL4 is passed down. The pattern for inheritance in Duane syndrome, called “autosomal dominant,” means that it occurs equally regardless of sex, and it can be inherited if just one parent has Duane syndrome.
Is Duane syndrome contagious?
No, Duane syndrome isn’t contagious. You can’t pass it on to someone like you can with an infection.
 and risk factors
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
What are the signs and symptoms?
Signs and symptoms of Duane syndrome, some of which may be seen in infants, may include:
An unusual position of the head. People with Duane syndrome sometimes turn their heads to the side to straighten their eyes.
Eyes that don’t point in the same direction, either at some times or all times (strabismus).
One eye — the one that’s affected — having lower vision (amblyopia, or lazy eye).
One eye seems smaller than the other because the eyelids narrow.
Eyes that move either up or down when you’re looking a certain way. This is called an up-shoot or down-shoot.
Do people with Duane syndrome have other conditions?
Duane syndrome doesn’t always happen with other conditions, but it sometimes does. These conditions may include:
Hearing disorders.
Goldenhar syndrome.
Problems with your spine or vertebrae.
There may also be other eye-related conditions that happen along with Duane syndrome, including:
Cataract; which refers to the clouding of the lens of your eye.
Microphthalmos; which means that your eye is unusually small.
Nystagmus; a condition in which your eyes move uncontrollably.
Crocodile tears syndrome, where someone with Bell’s palsy sheds tears while eating or drinking.
DIAGNOSIS METHOD
How is Duane syndrome diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will take a complete medical history and will do a thorough eye exam. They’ll measure how much misalignment is present and test how far your eyes, or your child’s eyes, can move from side to side.
Your provider may also want to order tests for other conditions that might be linked to Duane syndrome.
There’s another condition called sixth cranial nerve palsy that’s very similar to Duane syndrome but is much less common than Duane syndrome.
TREATMENT OPTIONS
Management and Treatment
How is Duane syndrome treated?
Treatment will depend on age, severity and other illnesses you might have.
Some people with Duane syndrome won’t need treatment. They’ll just need to keep a regular appointment schedule with their eye care providers.
People who also have amblyopia may benefit from patching their good eye so the weaker one becomes stronger.
If you have a severe case of Duane syndrome, you may need surgery on your eye muscles. The surgery can’t fix the nerve problem but it can change the position of eye muscles to relieve an abnormal head posture, straighten eyes when looking straight ahead, and improve up-shoots/down-shoots.
PREVENTION TIPS
How can I prevent Duane syndrome?
At this time, there’s no way to prevent Duane syndrome from happening. Thalidomide, the medication that can cause Duane syndrome (in addition to many other congenital conditions), is no longer available.
OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
What can I expect if I have Duane syndrome?
Some people with Duane syndrome can manage the condition by moving their heads slightly to improve their vision. In some cases, you may need surgery.
If you have another condition along with Duane syndrome, your provider will treat that condition also.
You may need glasses to improve vision and/or alignment.

ECTROPION
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Ectropion (ek-TROH-pee-on) is a condition in which your eyelid turns outward. This leaves the inner eyelid surface exposed and prone to irritation.
Ectropion is more common in older adults, and it generally affects only the lower eyelid. In severe ectropion, the entire length of the eyelid is turned out. In less severe ectropion, only one segment of the eyelid sags away from the eye.
Artificial tears and lubricating ointments can help relieve symptoms of ectropion. But usually, surgery is needed to fully correct the condition.
Ectropion can be caused by:
·        Muscle weakness. As you age, the muscles under your eyes tend to weaken, and tendons stretch out. These muscles and tendons hold your eyelid taut against your eye. When they weaken, your eyelid can begin to droop.
·        Facial paralysis. Certain conditions, such as Bell's palsy, and certain types of tumors can paralyze facial nerves and muscles. Facial paralysis that affects eyelid muscles can lead to ectropion.
·        Scars or previous surgeries. Skin that has been damaged by burns or trauma, such as a dog bite, can affect the way that your eyelid rests against your eye. Previous eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) can cause ectropion, particularly if a considerable amount of skin was removed from the eyelid at the time of surgery.
·        Eyelid growths. Benign or cancerous growths on your eyelid can cause the lid to turn outward.
·        Genetic disorders. Rarely is ectropion present at birth (congenital). When it is, it's usually associated with genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome.
 
 
Risk factors
Factors that increase your risk of developing ectropion include:
·        Age. The most common cause of ectropion is weakening muscle tissue associated with aging.
·        Previous eye surgeries. People who have had eyelid surgery are at higher risk of developing ectropion later.
·        Previous cancer burns or trauma. If you've had spots of skin cancer on your face, facial burns or trauma, you're at higher risk of developing ectropion.
Signs and symptoms
Normally when you blink, your eyelids distribute tears evenly across your eyes, keeping the surfaces of the eyes lubricated. These tears drain into small openings on the inner part of your eyelids (puncta).
If you have ectropion, your lower lid pulls away from your eye and tears don't drain properly into the puncta. The resulting signs and symptoms can include:
·        Watery eyes (excessive tearing). Without proper drainage, your tears may pool and constantly flow over your eyelids.
·        Excessive dryness. Ectropion can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty and sandy.
·        Irritation. Stagnant tears or dryness can irritate your eyes, causing a burning sensation and redness in your eyelids and the whites of your eyes.
·        Sensitivity to light. Stagnant tears or dry eyes can irritate the surface of the cornea, making you sensitive to light.
Diagnosis
Ectropion can usually be diagnosed with a routine eye exam and physical. Your doctor may pull on your eyelids during the exam or ask you to close your eyes forcefully. This helps him or her assess each eyelid's muscle tone and tightness.
If your ectropion is caused by a scar, tumor, previous surgery or radiation, your doctor will examine the surrounding tissue as well.
Understanding how other conditions cause ectropion is important in choosing the correct treatment or surgical technique.
Treatment
If your ectropion is mild, your doctor might recommend artificial tears and ointments to ease the symptoms. Surgery is generally required to fully correct ectropion.
Surgery
The type of surgery you have depends on the condition of the tissue surrounding your eyelid and on the cause of your ectropion:
·        Ectropion caused by muscle and ligament relaxation due to aging. Your surgeon will likely remove a small part of your lower eyelid at the outer edge. When the lid is stitched back together, the tendons and muscles of the lid will be tightened, causing the lid to rest properly on the eye. This procedure is generally relatively simple.
·        Ectropion caused by scar tissue from injury or previous surgery. Your surgeon might need to use a skin graft, taken from your upper eyelid or behind your ear, to help support the lower lid. If you have facial paralysis or significant scarring, you might need a second procedure to completely correct your ectropion.
Before surgery, you'll receive a local anesthetic to numb your eyelid and the area around it. You may be lightly sedated using oral or intravenous medication to make you more comfortable, depending on the type of procedure you're having and whether it's done in an outpatient surgical clinic.
After surgery you might need to:
·        Wear an eye patch for 24 hours
·        Use an antibiotic and steroid ointment on your eye several times a day for one week
·        Use cold compresses periodically to decrease bruising and swelling
After surgery you will likely experience:
·        Temporary swelling
·        Bruising on and around your eye
Your eyelid might feel tight after surgery. But as you heal, it will become more comfortable. Stitches are usually removed about a week after surgery. You can expect the swelling and bruising to fade in about two weeks.
 
Lifestyle and home remedies
These lifestyle tips may relieve your discomfort from ectropion:
·        Use eye lubricants. Artificial tears and eye ointments can help keep your cornea lubricated and prevent vision-threatening damage. Using an eye ointment and wearing a moisture shield over your eye is particularly useful overnight.
·        Wipe your eyes carefully. Constantly wiping watery eyes can make your under-eye muscles and tendons stretch even further, worsening your ectropion. Wipe from the outer eye up and in toward the nose.
 
 
Preparing for your appointment
If you have signs and symptoms of ectropion, you're likely to start by seeing your primary care doctor. He or she may refer you to a doctor who specializes in treating eye disorders (ophthalmologist).
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.
What you can do
Before your appointment take these steps:
·        List symptoms you've been having and for how long.
·        Find a photo of yourself before the appearance of your eyelid changed that you can bring to the appointment.
·        List all medications, vitamins and supplements you take, including the doses.
·        List key personal and medical information, including other conditions, recent life changes and stressors.
·        List questions to ask your doctor.
·        Ask a relative or friend to accompany you, to help you remember what the doctor says.
For ectropion, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:
·        What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
·        What kinds of tests do I need? Do they require any special preparation?
·        Is this condition temporary or long lasting?
·        Can ectropion damage my vision?
·        What treatments are available, and which do you recommend?
·        What are the risks of surgery?
·        What are the alternatives to surgery?
·        I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
·        Do you have any brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?
What to expect from your doctor
Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, such as:
·        When did you begin experiencing symptoms?
·        Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?
·        Have you had any previous surgery or procedures on your eye or eyelid?
·        Have you had any radiation treatments of your head and neck?
·        Have you had any other eye problems, such as an eye infection or an injury?
·        Are you taking any blood thinners?
·        Are you taking aspirin?
·        Are you using any eyedrops?
Prevention
Can I prevent entropion?
Because entropion often occurs naturally with aging or after scarring, it’s difficult to prevent. To reduce your risk of developing entropion caused by injury, wear protective eyewear during activities that could injure your eye.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have entropion?
Most people who receive treatment for entropion before it causes eye damage have a good outcome. Entropion surgery usually resolves the problem, and the condition rarely returns.
It’s important to treat entropion to avoid complications that may become permanent. Complications associated with an inward-turning eyelid include:
·        Eye infections
·        Corneal abrasions (scratches)
·        Vision loss
Complications
Ectropion leaves your cornea irritated and exposed, making it more susceptible to drying. The result can be abrasions and ulcers on the cornea, which can threaten your vision.
When to see a doctor
See your doctor if your eyes are constantly watering or irritated, or your eyelid seems to be sagging or drooping.
Seek immediate care if you have been diagnosed with ectropion and you experience:
·        Rapidly increasing redness in your eyes
·        Sensitivity to light
·        Decreasing vision
These are signs and symptoms of cornea exposure or ulcers, which can harm your vision.
DIFFERENTIAL diagnosis
Entropion should be differentiated from epiblepharon, trichiasis, trachoma, and distichiasis.

Epidemiology
The older an individual is, the greater the chances of developing an entropion[1]. Bilateral disease is three times more common than unilateral. Entropion is thought to occur more frequently in women than men, as women tend to have smaller tarsal plates than men
ENDOPHTHALMITIS
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Endophthalmitis (pronounced en-dof-thal-my-tis) is the medical name for an infection that affects the inside of your eye. In endophthalmitis, a bacterial or fungal infection triggers inflammation, an immune system response.
Endophthalmitis affects the aqueous humor and the vitreous humor. The aqueous humor is a normally clear fluid found between your lens and cornea at the front of your eye. The vitreous humor, a clear gel, sits between your lens and retina toward the back of your eye.
Endophthalmitis is a serious medical condition that needs immediate treatment. It can spread and cause vision loss. Panophthalmitis is the name for an infection that spreads to all parts of your eyeball and extends into the orbit.
An ophthalmologist may say that you have bacterial endophthalmitis or fungal endophthalmitis. They may also name the type of endophthalmitis by indicating how you got the infection. For example:
·        Exogenous endophthalmitis: This happens when something gets in your eye. You may develop exogenous endophthalmitis if you have an eye injury.
·        Endogenous endophthalmitis: You may develop this type of endophthalmitis because you have a fungal or bacterial infection in another part of your body that then spreads to the eye through your blood. Endogenous endophthalmitis is less common than exogenous endophthalmitis.
Causes and risk factors
What causes endophthalmitis?
There are many causes of endophthalmitis. For example, any eye trauma, such as a tree branch hitting your eye or having eye surgery, may lead to exogenous endophthalmitis. Likewise, many infections in the body could lead to endogenous endophthalmitis, but this is usually in people who are severely ill.
What are examples of penetrating eye trauma and exogenous endophthalmitis?
Common causes of ways that bacteria and fungi can get into your eye from the outside include:
·        Eye surgery: The most common eye surgery is cataract surgery, but you can also have surgery for glaucoma and other eye problems. Most people who develop postoperative endophthalmitis usually notice decreased vision and eye aches within a week or so after the procedure. Acute endophthalmitis comes on quickly after surgery. Chronic endophthalmitis takes longer to develop and may last longer.
·        Injections into the eye, called intraocular or intravitreal injections: Eye care providers may treat some condition by injecting certain medications into your vitreous humor. Age-related macular degeneration is example of a condition treated with intraocular or intravitreal injections.
·        Industrial or motor vehicle accidents: You can get a foreign object that penetrates your eye from an industrial or motor vehicle accident.
·        Sports: You can hurt your eye while playing contact sports.
What kinds of bacterial and fungal infections cause endogenous endophthalmitis?
In Europe and North America, the most common bacteria that cause endogenous endophthalmitis are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Candida albicans causes a majority of fungal infections.
Bacterial and fungal infections can spread through your body by getting into your bloodstream. Here are a few examples of these infections:
·        Having dental work.
·        Receiving intravenous drugs (through the vein, or IV).
·        Having pneumonia or sepsis.
·        Having surgical procedures anywhere inside your body.
·        Having an abscess or a skin ulcer.
·        Having a urinary tract infection.
Recent studies have found that some people who’ve had COVID-19 developed endogenous endophthalmitis. It’s most likely that the endophthalmitis resulted from an infection that developed in the hospital. The people most at risk seem to be people who:
·        Were in the hospital for a long time.
·        Have other serious medical conditions.
·        Were treated with IV antibiotics and other medicines.
Is endophthalmitis contagious?
Although infectious agents cause endophthalmitis, it doesn’t spread from person to person.
Signs and symptoms
What are the signs and symptoms of endophthalmitis?
Endophthalmitis signs and symptoms may include:
·        Red eyes.
·        Significant eye pain.
·        Loss of vision.
·        Sensitivity to bright light (photophobia).
·        Swollen eyelids.
·        Watery eyes (epiphora).

Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
How is endophthalmitis diagnosed?
An eye care provider will ask you about your health history and your current signs and symptoms. They’ll give you a complete eye exam.
They’ll take a sample of fluid or discharge from your eye to test in a laboratory. They may also want to test samples of your blood and urine.
In some cases, a provider might ask for an ultrasound of the eye (ocular ultrasound).
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
How is endophthalmitis treated?
An eye care provider may treat endophthalmitis with medicine. They may prescribe antibiotic or antifungal medications or corticosteroids. You may get eye drops or injections.
If the disease severely affects your vision, your provider may suggest a surgery called a vitrectomy. This procedure removes infectious material from your eye and lets the surgeon inject antibiotic or antifungal medication inside your eye.
Your provider may suggest you wear an eye patch for a time after the surgery.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk for endophthalmitis?
Ways to reduce your risk of endophthalmitis may include:
1. 	Always using protective eye gear if your job involves work where an object like a piece of machinery or a tool might hit your eye. You should also wear protective eye gear if you play contact sports.
2. 	Making sure your hands are clean if you have to touch your eyes.
3. 	Following provider recommendations for self-care after surgery.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have endophthalmitis?
As with many conditions, the outlook for endophthalmitis is typically better if it’s caught and treated early. Outcomes may be worse in people who have immune systems that don’t work well or have diabetes.
Some people have low vision that lasts after treatment. If this happens, speak to your healthcare team about getting support.
Living With
How do I take care of myself?
If you have endophthalmitis, you’ll need regular eye appointments. Always tell a healthcare provider about any change in vision or eye pain.
If you have vision loss after treatment, your provider can help you find support services if they’re necessary.
Complications/side effects of the treatment
Possible complications from intravitreal injections of anti-infective drugs include damage to the cornea or the retina.
·        Panophthalmitis
·        Glaucoma
·        Orbital cellulitis
·        Intracranial spread
·        Septicemia
·        Loss of vision
·        Phthisis
·        Hypotony
·        Painful blind eye

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Post-surgical Endophthalmitis
1. 	Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) is an acute inflammatory condition presenting within 24 hours of surgery with a severe anterior chamber reaction, limbus to limbus corneal edema. However, there is no adnexal involvement, and the patient responds dramatically to the addition of steroids. Various features differentiating TASS from acute postoperative endophthalmitis are listed in figure 4 (common differentiating features of TASS with endophthalmitis).

9. 	Intravitreal cysticercus with intraocular inflammation
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
The relative frequency of various subtypes of endophthalmitis varies depending upon the geography, level of specialization at the ophthalmic center, and study duration. For example, studies before 2005 have very few cases of post intravitreal anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) injection endophthalmitis as anti-VEGF agents received first FDA approval in 2004.
In a recent retrospective cohort study in the U.S., acute onset endophthalmitis occurred in 0.04% of cataract surgeries and 0.016% of patients receiving an intravitreal injection. The incidence of post-traumatic endophthalmitis varies from 0.9% to 17%.
Case series from Asian countries have reported an incidence of 0.023% to 0.076% of endophthalmitis in post-cataract surgery setting and 0.01% to 0.10% post intravitreal injections.
Among the intraocular surgeries, secondary intraocular lens implantation seems to have a very high risk (0.36%) for acute endophthalmitis, and trabeculectomy may have a high risk (1.8%, maybe up to 5.7%) for delayed or late-onset endophthalmitis especially after the advent of mitomycin-C or 5-fluorouracil.
Endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy had the lowest rates (0.046%) when compared with other ocular surgeries [secondary IOL-0.366%, combined penetrating keratoplasty (PK) with cataract surgery- 0.194%, PK- 0.178%, glaucoma surgeries -0.124%, combined trabeculectomy and cataract surgery- 0.114%, overall incidence after intraocular surgery-0.093%, and cataract surgery with or without IOL-0.082%] in a study.
There is no significant difference in the rates of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of various anti-VEGF agents. Cluster endophthalmitis cases have occurred after intravitreal use of bevacizumab due to either lapse in the cold chain, sub-optimal compounding of bevacizumab aliquots, or fake drug.

How soon after treatment will I feel better?
Your symptoms of pain and redness may begin to improve after a few days, but you may continue to have vision problems after that. It can take weeks or even months for endophthalmitis to resolve completely.

EYE MELANOMA
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Eye melanoma is a kind of eye cancer that starts in cells within the eye that make melanin. Melanin is most often known as the pigment that gives skin its color. But the eyes have cells that make melanin too. Eye melanoma also is called ocular melanoma, intraocular melanoma and uveal melanoma. 
Most eye melanomas form in parts of the eye you can't see when looking in a mirror. That makes eye melanoma hard to notice. And eye melanoma typically doesn't cause symptoms at first. 
Eye melanoma can be treated. Treatment for small eye melanomas may not cause vision problems. But treatment for large eye melanomas typically leads to some vision loss. 
Causes
Causes 
It's not clear what causes eye melanoma. 
Eye melanoma happens when cells in the eye develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA tells the cells to grow and multiply at a set rate. The DNA also tells the cells to die at a set time. 
In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells die. This causes too many cells. 
The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. 
Where eye melanoma develops 
Eye melanoma most often happens in the cells of the middle layer of the eye, called the uvea. The uvea has three parts. Each part can be affected by eye melanoma: 
The iris. The iris is the colored part at the front of the eye. 
The choroid layer. The choroid layer is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue. It's located at the back of the uvea. 
The ciliary body. The ciliary body is located behind the iris. It helps the eye focus. It also makes a transparent liquid, called aqueous humor, that fills the front part of the eye. 
Eye melanoma can happen in other parts of the eye. But this is very rare. Other parts of the eye that can develop melanoma include: 
The layer on the front of the eye, called the conjunctiva. 
The socket that surrounds the eyeball, called the orbit. 
The eyelid. 
Risk factors 
Risk factors for eye melanoma include: 
Light eye color. People with blue eyes or green eyes have a higher risk of melanoma of the eye. 
Being white. White people have a greater risk of eye melanoma than do people of other races. 
Age. The risk of eye melanoma goes up with age. 
Certain inherited skin conditions. A condition called dysplastic nevus syndrome, which causes unusual moles, can raise the risk of eye melanoma. 
People who have a condition called ocular melanocytosis also are at higher risk of eye melanoma. This condition involves unusual skin pigmentation on the eyelids and in the tissue around the eyelids. It also leads to more pigmentation on the eye's uvea. 
Certain genetic changes. Some DNA changes that are passed from parents to children may raise the risk of eye melanoma. 
Exposure to ultraviolet light. Some research suggests that exposure to ultraviolet light could raise the risk of eye melanoma. Sources of ultraviolet light include the sun, as well as tanning beds. 
Healthcare professionals haven't found anything that can prevent eye melanoma. 
Signs and symptoms
Eye melanoma may not cause any symptoms. When they do happen, signs and symptoms of eye melanoma can include: 
Flashes of light or what look like specks of dust in a person's vision. These are sometimes called floaters. 
A growing dark spot in the colored part of the eye, called the iris. 
A change in the shape of the pupil. The pupil is the dark circle at the center of the eye. 
Poor vision or blurry vision in one eye. 
Not being able to see when looking to the side. This is called loss of peripheral vision. 
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Treatment 
Not all eye melanomas need treatment. When treatment is needed, it can include radiation therapy, laser therapy, photodynamic therapy or surgery. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy may be used to treat eye melanoma in some situations. 
Which treatment is best for eye melanoma depends on several factors. These factors include the size and location of the cancer. Treatment also depends on whether cancer has spread beyond the eye. Your overall health and what you prefer to do is part of treatment planning too. 
Waiting to treat small eye melanomas 
A small eye melanoma may not need to be treated right away. If the melanoma is small and isn't growing, you and your healthcare professional might choose to wait and watch for signs of growth. 
If the melanoma grows or causes other health concerns, you may choose to have treatment at that time. 
Radiation therapy for eye melanoma 
Radiation therapy treats cancer with powerful energy. Radiation therapy is typically used for small to medium-sized eye melanomas. 
For eye melanoma, radiation therapy often involves placing a radioactive device on the eye. The device is called a plaque. It looks like a bottle cap. The plaque holds several radioactive seeds. A healthcare professional places the plaque on the eye, over the cancer. The plaque is held in place with temporary stitches. The plaque stays in place for a few days. Then it's removed. Radiation treatment that involves putting the radiation inside the body is called brachytherapy. 
The radiation also can come from a machine that aims beams of radiation, such as proton beams. The beams can be aimed at the eye to treat eye melanoma. Giving radiation with a machine outside the body is called external beam radiation. This type of radiation therapy often is given over several days. 
Laser therapy for eye melanoma 
Laser therapy uses a laser light to hurt the cancer cells. For eye melanoma, it might be used in some situations. One type of laser treatment, called thermotherapy, uses an infrared laser. It's sometimes used along with radiation therapy to treat eye melanoma. 
Photodynamic therapy for eye melanoma 
Photodynamic therapy is a two-stage treatment that combines light energy with a medicine called a photosensitizer. The photosensitizer kills cancerous and precancerous cells when activated by light, usually from a laser. For eye melanoma, photodynamic therapy is used for smaller cancers. 
Surgery for eye melanoma 
Surgery to treat eye melanoma may involve removing the melanoma or removing the entire eye. 
Surgery to remove the melanoma. Surgery to remove the melanoma and a band of healthy tissue around it may be an option for treating some small eye melanomas. 
Surgery to remove the eye. Surgery to remove an eye is called enucleation. It may be used for some large eye melanomas. 
After the eye with melanoma is removed, an implant often is put into the same place. The muscles that control the movement of the eye are attached to the implant. That allows the implant to move. After the eye has time to heal, an artificial eye, called a prosthesis, is made that matches the other eye. 
Targeted therapy for eye melanoma 
Targeted therapy for cancer is a treatment that uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die. For eye melanoma, targeted therapy may be used when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or in situations where surgery isn't possible. 
Immunotherapy for eye melanoma 
Immunotherapy for cancer is a treatment with medicine that helps the body's immune system kill cancer cells. The immune system fights off diseases by attacking germs and other cells that shouldn't be in the body. Cancer cells survive by hiding from the immune system. Immunotherapy helps the immune system cells find and kill the cancer cells. For eye melanoma, immunotherapy may be used when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or in situations where surgery isn't possible. 
Prevention tips
PROGNOSIS 
Local treatment prevents local recurrence in 95% of patients. However, due to micrometastasis, 50% of patients with uveal tumors develop metastatic disease. Metastatic disease is typically fatal, with a median survival of only 10 months after diagnosis. Several prognostic indicators leading to poor outcomes include increased patient age, the largest basal diameter of the tumor, ciliary body involvement, extrascleral tumor extension, epithelioid cell type, and vasculogenic mimicry patterns. 
Chromosomal analysis identifying monosomy 3 and 8q gain can help determine prognosis to some extent, but gene expression profiling proves to have better prognostic abilities. Gene expression profiling assesses the expression of 12 discriminating genes and 3 control genes to determine the metastatic potential, classifying patients into either class 1, indicating low potential, or class 2, indicating high potential. In addition, detecting circulating tumor cells or DNA may be a prognostic indicator for metastatic disease. 
The 5-year survival rate for conjunctival melanoma with treatment is 83% to 84%, and the 10-year survival rate is 69% to 80%. The overall mortality for choroidal melanoma and ciliary body melanoma is 30% to 50% within 10 years, primarily due to metastatic disease. The overall mortality rate for iris melanoma is 0% to 11%. 
Possible complications
Complications 
Some people develop other health concerns linked to eye melanoma. These are called complications. They can include the following: 
Vision loss 
Eye melanoma can cause vision loss. Sometimes vision loss is a symptom of an eye melanoma. Sometimes vision loss is caused by eye melanoma treatment. 
Eye melanoma that spreads beyond the eye 
Eye melanoma can spread outside of the eye to other areas of the body, including the liver, lungs and bones. 
Diagnosis 
Eye melanoma diagnosis often starts with an eye exam. Imaging tests can help show the size of the cancer. 
Eye exam 
During an eye exam for eye melanoma, a healthcare professional may first examine the outside of the eye. The health professional may look for blood vessels that are larger than usual. Large blood vessels might mean there's something concerning happening inside the eye. 
An eye exam also involves looking inside the eye with the help of special equipment. One way to do that uses lenses and a bright light mounted on a healthcare professional's forehead. This is called binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. Another method uses lenses and a microscope that has an intense beam of light that lights up the inside of the eye. This is called slit-lamp biomicroscopy. 
Fundus photography 
Fundus photography is a test that takes color pictures of the inside surface of the eye. This part of the eye is called the fundus. Fundus photography can show an eye melanoma. The test might be repeated to watch a melanoma over time. Different kinds of tests can take pictures of the fundus to show an eye melanoma. One example is fundus autofluorescence. 
Eye ultrasound 
An eye ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to make images of the eye. The sound waves come from a device that looks like a wand, called a transducer. A healthcare professional places the transducer on the closed eyelid or on the front surface of the eye to get the pictures. 
Eye angiography 
Angiography is a test that makes pictures of the blood vessels. To get pictures of the blood vessels in the eye, a colored dye is injected into a vein in an arm. The dye travels to the blood vessels in the eye. A camera with special filters to detect the dye takes pictures of the eye every few seconds for several minutes. Tests that can make pictures of the blood vessels in the eye include fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography. 
Optical coherence tomography 
Optical coherence tomography is an imaging test that uses light waves to make pictures of the eye. It can make pictures of the uvea and the retina that might show an eye melanoma. 
Eye melanoma biopsy 
A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue for testing in a lab. A biopsy typically isn't necessary to diagnose eye melanoma. But it may be used in some situations. Sometimes a biopsy may be done at the time of treatment to get more information about the cancer cells. 
Testing for cancer spread 
Other tests may be needed to see if melanoma has spread to other parts of the body. The tests may include: 
Blood tests. 
Tests to check how well the liver works. 
Chest X-ray. 
Ultrasound. 
Computerized tomography scan, also called CT scan. 
Magnetic resonance imaging, also called MRI. 
Positron emission tomography scan, also called PET scan.

When to see a doctor 
Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you have any symptoms of eye melanoma. If you notice sudden changes in your vision, seek emergency medical care right away. 
Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 
In a clinical setting, ocular melanoma may exhibit similarities to various diseases. Although distinguishing these growths based on their clinical appearance is possible, a biopsy remains the sole definitive method to confirm a diagnosis. The differential diagnoses for choroidal melanoma and ciliary body melanoma are as follows: 
Choroidal detachment 
Intraocular foreign body 
Chronic angle closure glaucoma 
Hyphema 
Cavernous hemangioma 
Vitreous hemorrhage 
Age-related macular degeneration 
Melanocytoma 
Medulloepithelioma 
Choroidal osteoma 
Adenoma 
Adenocarcinoma 
Combined hamartoma of the retina and pigment epithelium 
Congenital hypertrophy and reactive hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium 
Lymphoid tumor 
Hemangiopericytoma 
Leiomyoma 
Neurofibroma 
Glioneuroma 
Astrocytoma 
Rhabdomyosarcoma 
Posterior uveitis 
Sarcoid nodules 
Tubercular granuloma 
Uveitis 
The differential diagnoses for iris melanoma are as follows: 
Iris pigment epithelial cyst 
Iris stromal cyst 
Iris nevi 
Iris metastases 
Iris foreign body 
Iridocorneal endothelial syndrome 
Koeppe or Busacca nodules 
Lisch nodules 
Peripheral anterior synechiae 
Other iris tumors, such as leiomyoma and rhabdomyosarcoma 
Cogan-Reese syndrome 
Clinicians must distinguish conjunctival melanoma from other conditions, including conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma; conjunctival melanosis; conjunctival mycosis; conjunctival seborrheic keratosis; acquired melanosis; foreign body like graphite; drug toxicity, such as epinephrine; and pseudomelanoma. 
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
Ocular melanoma is the most prevalent primary intraocular malignancy in adults, accounting for 3% to 5% of all melanomas. Uveal melanoma accounts for 85% to 90%, with 5% originating in the iris and the remainder arising from the ciliary body or choroid. The median age of diagnosis is approximately 62, with a peak incidence observed between 70 and 79. 
White patients of northern European descent have the highest incidence of disease. In contrast, the incidence among Black patients is low, whereas the incidence in patients who are Asian or Hispanic is considered moderate. Men have a 30% higher incidence compared to females. In the United States, the incidence of ocular melanoma is approximately 5 per 1 million population. Internationally, in countries with large populations of individuals of northern European descent, the incidence is 7.5 per 1 million people annually.

Floaters: 
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Small spots or threads in vision caused by debris in the vitreous humor. Eye floaters are spots in your vision. They may look to you like black or gray specks, strings, or cobwebs. They may drift about when you move your eyes. Floaters appear to dart away when you try to look at them directly.
Most eye floaters are caused by age-related changes that occur as the jelly-like substance (vitreous) inside your eyes liquifies and contracts. Scattered clumps of collagen fibers form within the vitreous and can cast tiny shadows on your retina. The shadows you see are called floaters.
If you notice a sudden increase in eye floaters, contact an eye specialist immediately — especially if you also see light flashes or lose your vision. These can be symptoms of an emergency that requires prompt attention.
What do eye floaters look like?
There are many ways to describe eye floaters. Some people see spiders, amoebas or clouds. Your own creativity guides how you think a floater looks. Your description of floaters might sound completely different from someone else’s definition. If you have floaters, you might see:
Squiggly lines.
Spots.
Spider Like shapes.
Threadlike strands.
Small shadowy shapes.
Black or very dark spots.
Are eye floaters normal?
In most cases, eye floaters are a normal and common part of the aging process. As you get older, the fluid within your eyes (vitreous) shrinks. This is normal and doesn’t mean that your eyes aren’t healthy.
It’s important to maintain regular eye exams over time, especially if you’re experiencing chronic floaters. Chronic floaters usually aren’t something you need to be concerned about, but it’s a good idea to have your eyes regularly checked to make sure there aren’t any other serious eye issues. If you experience an acute (sudden) onset of floaters and flashes, you should see an eye care provider.
Can eye floaters happen in only one eye or both eyes at the same time?
Your eyes may not age in the same way or at the exact same time. The vitreous might shrink in one eye a little faster than in the other. Often, you’ll have floaters in one eye at a time. It can happen to both of your eyes but usually not at the same time.
Are there stages or different severity levels of eye floaters?
Noticing eye floaters is normal, but if you notice a group of new floaters at one time, contact your eye care provider. Sudden changes in vision, including a number of new eye floaters, mean that you should set up an appointment with an eye specialist.
CAUSES
Eye floaters may be caused by vitreous changes related to aging or from other diseases or conditions:
Age-related eye changes. The vitreous is a jelly-like substance made primarily of water, collagen (a type of protein) and hyaluronan (a type of carbohydrate). The vitreous fills the space in your eye between the lens and retina and helps the eye maintain its round shape.
As you age, the vitreous changes. Over time, it liquifies and contracts — a process that causes it to pull away from the eyeball's inside surface.
As the vitreous changes, collagen fibers within the vitreous form clumps and strings. These scattered pieces block some of the light passing through the eye. This casts tiny shadows on your retina that are seen as floaters.
Inflammation in the back of the eye. Uveitis is inflammation in the middle layer of tissue in the eye wall (uvea). Posterior uveitis affects the back of the eye, which includes the retina and an eye layer called the choroid. The inflammation causes floaters in the vitreous. Causes of posterior uveitis include infection, autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases.
Bleeding in the eye. Bleeding into the vitreous can have many causes, including retinal tears and detachments, diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), blocked blood vessels, and injury. Blood cells are seen as floaters.
Torn retina. Retinal tears can happen when a contracting vitreous tugs on the retina with enough force to tear it. Without treatment, a retinal tear may lead to retinal detachment. If fluid leaks behind the tear, it can cause the retina to separate from the back of your eye. Untreated retinal detachment can cause permanent vision loss.
Eye surgeries and eye medications. Certain medications that are injected into the vitreous can cause air bubbles to form. These bubbles are seen as shadows until your eye absorbs them. Silicone oil bubbles added during certain surgeries on the vitreous and retina also can be seen as floaters.
Risk factors
Factors that can increase your risk of eye floaters include:
Age over 50 years
Nearsightedness
Eye injury
Complications from cataract surgery
Diabetes complication that causes damage to the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy)
Eye inflammation
Symptoms
Symptoms of eye floaters may include:
Small shapes in your vision that appear as dark specks or knobby, transparent strings of floating material
Spots that move when you move your eyes, so when you try to look at them, they move quickly out of your line of vision
Spots that are most noticeable when you look at a plain bright background, such as a blue sky or a white wall
Small shapes or strings that eventually settle down and drift out of the line of vision
Diagnosis
Your eye care specialist conducts a complete eye exam to determine the cause of your eye floaters. Your exam usually includes eye dilation. Eye drops widen (dilate) the dark center of your eye. This allows your specialist to better see the back of your eyes and the vitreous.
Treatment
Most eye floaters don't require treatment. However, any medical condition that is the cause of eye floaters, such as bleeding from diabetes or inflammation, should be treated.
Eye floaters can be frustrating and adjusting to them can take time. Once you know the floaters will not cause any more problems, over time you may be able to ignore them or notice them less often.
If your eye floaters get in the way of your vision, which happens rarely, you and your eye care specialist may consider treatment. Options may include surgery to remove the vitreous or a laser to disrupt the floaters, although both procedures are rarely done.
Surgery to remove the vitreous. An ophthalmologist who is a specialist in retina and vitreous surgery removes the vitreous through a small incision (vitrectomy). The vitreous is replaced with a solution to help your eye maintain its shape. Surgery may not remove all the floaters, and new floaters can develop after surgery. Risks of a vitrectomy include infection, bleeding and retinal tears.
Using a laser to disrupt the floaters. An ophthalmologist aims a special laser at the floaters in the vitreous (vitreolysis). This may break up the floaters and make them less noticeable. Some people who have this treatment report improved vision; others notice little or no difference. Risks of laser therapy include damage to your retina if the laser is aimed incorrectly.
Prevention tips
Can eye floaters be prevented?
You can’t prevent eye floaters that are due to age, but you may be able to reduce your risk of floaters by managing chronic illnesses like diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension).
Are eye floaters an emergency?
Eye floaters aren’t usually emergencies. You don’t need to worry if you see the occasional floater. You should let your eye care provider know about the floaters and have your eyes checked regularly to make sure there are no other vision issues.
However, if you suddenly have more floaters than normal, reach out to your healthcare provider right away. This could be a sign of a retinal tear or detachment. These conditions need immediate treatment.
Prognosis
Possible complications
What are the possible complications of floaters?
There aren’t complications of floaters caused by aging. If floaters are due to retinal diseases, your vision can be at risk.
When to see a doctor
Contact an eye specialist immediately if you notice:
Many more eye floaters than usual
A sudden onset of new floaters
Flashes of light in the same eye as the floaters
A gray curtain or blurry area that blocks part of your vision
Darkness on a side or sides of your vision (peripheral vision loss)
These painless symptoms could be caused by a retinal tear, with or without a retinal detachment. This is a sight-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
What can I do at home to treat floaters?
There are no home remedies for floaters.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis includes:
Vitreous floater/posterior vitreous detachment
Vitreous hemorrhage
Retinal tear or detachment
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
A vitreous detachment typically affects patients older than 50 and increases in prevalence by age 80. Individuals who are myopic or nearsighted have an increased risk of vitreous floaters. Additionally, eyes with an inflammatory disease after direct trauma to the globe or having recently undergone eye surgery have an increased chance of developing a vitreous floater. Men and women appear to be affected equally.

Glaucoma
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Glaucoma is a group of diseases that damage the optic nerve, it is often associated with increased eye pressure, causing gradual vision loss and potentially blindness. It often progresses slowly without noticeable symptoms, earning it the nickname “sneak thief of sight”. It includes open-angle and angle-closure types.156
Angle-closure glaucoma is one of two main types of glaucoma, a condition that’s defined by high pressure within your eye. The name for this pressure is intraocular pressure (IOP). 

High IOP happens because fluid called aqueous humor can’t flow freely in your eye. In angle-closure glaucoma, a bulging or swollen iris (the colored part of your eye) blocks the drainage system. The condition may happen quickly or over time. 

Other names for angle-closure glaucoma are closed-angle glaucoma and narrow-angle glaucoma. 

Types of angle-closure glaucoma 

There are different types of angle-closure glaucoma, including primary and secondary forms. 

Primary angle-closure glaucoma 

Acute angle-closure glaucoma comes on quickly and is a medical emergency because permanent vision damage can happen very quickly. Symptoms include severe eye pain, blurred vision, halos, nausea, vomiting and red eye. 

Intermittent angle-closure glaucoma refers to cases where the drainage system changes from open to closed. You may or may not have symptoms. 

Chronic angle-closure glaucoma may not cause symptoms at the beginning. But gradually, symptoms develop over time. Later, it might result in an episode of acute angle-closure glaucoma or a gradual increase of pressure with possible damage to your optic nerve. 

Secondary angle-closure glaucoma 

This form happens along with another condition. These include: 

Poorly managed diabetes, which can cause a condition called proliferative diabetes-related retinopathy. 

Poorly managed blood pressure or other vascular diseases that can lead to conditions like ischemic central vein occlusion. 

Uveitis. 

Membranes and scars from injury or inflammation. 

How common is it? 

Angle-closure glaucoma will happen to about 1 in 1,000 people. It’s most likely to happen after the age of 40. 

One estimate is that 17.14 million people throughout the world who are over 40 have primary angle-closure glaucoma, with a majority (12.3 million people) in Asia. 

Symptoms and Causes 

What are the symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma? 

Acute angle-closure glaucoma symptoms may include: 

Severe eye pain. 

Redness. 

Vision loss. 

Seeing rainbow-colored rings around lights or halos. 

Headache. 

Nausea and vomiting. 

When they’re present, which doesn’t always happen, symptoms of chronic angle-closure glaucoma and other forms of non-acute angle-closure glaucoma may include: 

Redness. 

Blurred vision. 

Eye discomfort. 

Headache or brow ache. 

What causes angle-closure glaucoma? 

Angle-closure glaucoma happens because aqueous humor in your eye can’t flow in and out as it normally should. Your body constantly makes new fluid to replace the existing fluid. 

When the old fluid can’t leave your eye, it backs up and causes pressure. The pressure causes damage to your optic nerve. 

There are many reasons that you can get glaucoma. With angle-closure glaucoma, the reason is that your natural lens thickens over time and pushes against your iris, blocking the drainage passages. 

Is it genetic/hereditary? 

Research indicates that angle-closure glaucoma has an association with family history and certain genes. 

What are the risk factors for angle-closure glaucoma? 

Risk factors for developing angle-closure glaucoma include: 

Age: The risk rises with age as IOP increases and your eye changes. 

Sex: The risk is higher for females. 

Ethnicity: The risk is higher for people of Asian descent. 

What are the complications? 

Like other forms of glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma can damage your optic nerve and cause permanent loss of vision. 

Diagnosis and Tests 

How is angle-closure glaucoma diagnosed? 

Any medical examination begins with your provider asking you questions about your symptoms and medical history, including information on your biological family’s history. 

Your eye care provider will give you a thorough eye exam. 

What tests will be done to diagnose this condition? 

Your provider will diagnose angle-closure glaucoma using: 

Gonioscopy. This test can assess the drainage angle in your eye. 

Slit-lamp exam. A special microscope lets your provider see inside your eye. 

Tests to measure eye pressure (IOP). 

Testing your peripheral vision with visual field tests. 

Imaging tests like optical coherence tomography or ultrasound. 

If your provider thinks you have angle-closure glaucoma, they’ll avoid using drugs that dilate your pupils because those medications could make drainage worse. 

Management and Treatment 

How is angle-closure glaucoma treated? 

There’s no cure for angle-closure glaucoma, but there are treatments. 

Treatments for acute angle-closure glaucoma 

Treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma must happen quickly to avoid vision loss. 

Your provider will offer treatments that may include: 

Medications. These include timolol, pilocarpine and brimonidine eye drops and oral acetazolamide. 

Laser iridotomy. This is a procedure that makes a hole in your iris to allow fluid to flow freely. If you have an episode of acute angle-closure glaucoma in one eye, your provider will do an iridotomy on both eyes. Otherwise, you’re at risk of having an episode in your other eye. 

Treatment for non-acute angle-closure glaucoma 

Your provider is likely to treat non-acute forms of angle-closure glaucoma with laser iridotomy. 

Your provider may also suggest cataract removal, which should make the progression of chronic angle-closure glaucoma go more slowly. 

Complications/side effects of the treatments for angle-closure glaucoma 

Complications may include blurred vision and sensitivity to light for a few days. You may also experience a streak of light from the site of the laser treatment. You typically need a driver to take you home after the procedure, but you may start normal activities the next day. 

Prevention 

Can angle closure glaucoma be prevented? 

No, you can’t prevent angle-closure glaucoma. But screening eye exams with an eye care provider will help you know if you have risks for angle closure glaucoma. They’ll then suggest treatment and medications to avoid if you’re at risk. It’s also very important to manage your blood sugar if you have diabetes. 

Outlook / Prognosis 

What can I expect if I have angle-closure glaucoma? 

If you have treatment for angle-closure glaucoma, your outlook should be good. If you have acute angle-closure glaucoma, you need immediate treatment to preserve your vision. 

You should listen to your provider’s suggestions on when and how often to return for eye exams. 

Living With 

When should I see my healthcare provider? 

You should always see an eye care provider if you have changes in your vision. Follow the appointment schedule they suggest for you. 

When should I go to an emergency room? 

Times when you should get emergency medical help, like calling your eye care provider or going to an ER, include these events: 

Symptoms that start up suddenly, like vision loss. 

Severe eye pain. 

A combination of symptoms, like red eye or nausea and eye pain. 

An eye injury. 

Symptoms that develop after any type of eye surgery. 

What questions should I ask my doctor or eye care provider? 

You may want to ask your healthcare team these questions: 

What type of glaucoma do I have? 

What treatment do you recommend? 

Is the type of glaucoma I have hereditary? 

What are the side effects of treatment? 

What’s the outlook for my condition in the short term and the long term? 

Are there activities that I should avoid? 

How often should I schedule appointments? 

Am I eligible to participate in a clinical trial? 

Do you know of any support groups I could join? 

It can help to take notes during your appointments. You may also want to bring a family member or friend to help you remember questions and answers.

Hemianopia
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
There are different types of hemianopia, including homonymous hemianopia and heteronymous hemianopia. Each type is classified by what part of the visual field is affected. 
Because hemianopia stems from an event or complication, hemianopia is considered a brain condition, not an eye condition. 
Types of Hemianopia
The visual pathway is part of the central nervous system (CNS). It is made up of several vital neurons that turn light into visual stimuli, including:
Retina (thin tissue layer in the back of the eye that translates light to the optic nerve)
Optic nerves (communication pathway between the eye and the brain)
Optic chiasm (joining together of the optic nerves of both eyes)
Visual cortex (primary area of the brain that receives and processes light from the retina)
During visual processing, the optic nerve from the right eye joins with the optic nerve from the left to form an X-shaped structure called the optic chiasm. The optic nerves then cross paths and continue on the optic tract to the brain. 
The brain is divided into two halves, which are the right side and the left side:
The left side is responsible for vision in the right visual field of each eye
The right side is responsible for vision in the left visual field of each eye
The type of hemianopia depends on the location of the disturbance in the brain or visual pathway.
Homonymous Hemianopia
Homonymous hemianopia (also known as homonymous hemianopsia or HH) is a symptom that makes you see only one side ― right or left ― of the visual field of each of your eyes. “Homonymous” in this context means “the same side of both eyes,” and “hemianopia” (sometimes spelled “hemianopsia”) means “half vision loss.”
Your visual field is everything you see when your eyes are open. When your vision works correctly, everything on the right side of your visual field goes to the left side of your brain, and everything on the left side goes to the right side of your brain. Your visual system has a special setup to make that happen.
Each optic nerve carries visual information from both sides until they reach a point in your brain called the optic chiasm (pronounced “KY-azm”). Once the nerve fibers get there, some of the fibers change directions. Nerve fibers from both eyes that handle the left side of your vision go to the right side of your brain and vice versa.
HH affects signals from the same side of both eyes traveling together after passing the chiasm. That’s why HH causes vision loss on the same side of both eyes. Experts classify it as a visual field defect, and the conditions that cause it all affect your brain. It’s usually sudden, but some conditions can make it develop more gradually.
Possible Causes
What are the most common causes of homonymous hemianopia?
HH means something is disrupting your visual system on one side of your brain. Between 42% and 89% of HH cases happen because of these three life-threatening emergency conditions:
Strokes.
Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).
Brain bleeds (intracranial hemorrhages).
Strokes and TIAs
Strokes happen when something disrupts blood flow to part of your brain. Without blood flow, the affected brain areas stop working correctly and start dying. When this is severe or lasts too long, it causes permanent brain damage. These can happen because of a blockage (ischemic stroke) or bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke).
People often call TIAs “mini-strokes,” but they aren’t necessarily smaller. They’re like an ischemic stroke, but the symptoms are temporary (they usually stop if you sit down or rest). But having a TIA greatly increases your risk of having a stroke within the next few days. That’s why a TIA is also a medical emergency, just like a stroke.
Brain bleeds
Bleeding inside your brain is dangerous because the blood has nowhere to go. Over time, the buildup of blood can press on and damage your brain.
Other conditions that can cause homonymous hemianopia
Many other brain conditions can also cause HH when they damage vision-related areas. Some of these conditions are dangerous or life-threatening. Others are relatively minor, and the risk of permanent damage is minimal.
Examples of other conditions that can cause HH include:
Brain infections and inflammation (such as encephalitis or neurosyphilis).
Brain lesions.
Brain tumors (including cancer).
Concussions and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs).
Degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO).
Metabolic conditions or effects, like low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).
Migraines (especially migraines with auras).
Seizures and epilepsy.
Care and Treatment
How is homonymous hemianopia treated?
The treatments for HH vary widely depending on the underlying cause. Some examples of treatment options for specific conditions that can cause homonymous hemianopia include:
Ischemic stroke or TIA: The main treatments for ischemic stroke restore blood flow with medications, like anticoagulants or clot-busting (thrombolytic) drugs, or specific medical procedures like thrombectomy.
Brain bleeds and hemorrhagic stroke: Treatments usually involve surgery (like craniectomy or craniotomy) to relieve pressure inside your skull and repair the affected blood vessel, if possible.
Migraines: Treatments usually include preventive medications that keep migraines from happening or abortive (“rescue”) medications to stop them when they happen. Dozens of medications fall into one or both of those categories.
Seizures and epilepsy: Antiseizure medications can stop seizures, prevent them or both. Epilepsy surgery is also an option if medications aren’t effective or helpful.
Something to remember is that treatments that work for one cause may not work for others, or they could do more damage. Because there are so many treatment options and other factors in play, your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you about the treatment options for your specific case.
Can homonymous hemianopia be prevented?
HH is impossible to prevent, and it happens unpredictably. But you can reduce your risk of having some of the conditions that cause it if you take the following steps:
See a healthcare provider for an annual physical or checkup to improve the odds of early detection of conditions that could cause HH.
Wear safety gear like helmets and seatbelts to reduce the risk of head injuries.
Reach and maintain a weight that’s healthy for you to prevent or delay a stroke or similar conditions.
Manage chronic conditions to prevent issues or events that could cause HH, like taking epilepsy medicine to prevent seizures or anticoagulants to prevent clots that could cause a stroke.
When To Call the Doctor
When should homonymous hemianopia be treated by a doctor or healthcare provider?
If you’ve never experienced homonymous hemianopsia before, you should react like it’s a medical emergency. HH is most likely a symptom of a life-threatening emergency condition like a stroke or brain bleed.
The best and safest course of action is to call 911 (or your local emergency services number) immediately. You shouldn’t try to drive yourself to get medical care because the loss or disruption in your vision can make driving dangerous to yourself and others.
If you’ve experienced HH before and have a diagnosed condition that can cause it, how you respond can vary slightly. You should ask your healthcare provider what to do if you have it again. They can give you more specific guidance on when this symptom needs immediate medical attention.
But when in doubt, the safest thing to do is to get medical attention. Many conditions that cause HH are time-sensitive, and seconds can make a huge difference.

Heteronymous Hemianopia
Heteronymous hemianopia is a bilateral visual field defect on the opposite sides of each eye. 
This type of hemianopia results from a lesion on the optic chiasm, the X shape structure where the optic nerves meet and cross. 
The types of heteronymous hemianopia include:
Bitemporal hemianopia is vision loss in the outer part of the visual field in each eye
Binasal hemianopia is vision loss in the inner part of the visual field in each eye
Common Symptoms
Depending on the underlying cause of hemianopia, it can be either temporary or permanent. 
Symptoms of homonymous hemianopia range from mild to severe and include:
Disturbed site and missing objects in the visual field
Blurry or double vision 
Dimmed vision 
Trouble with night vision 
Visual hallucinations 
Visual neglect is when you fail to notice on one side of your visual field
Heteronymous hemianopia symptoms are less severe and usually only cause depth perception and peripheral vision problems.

What Causes Hemianopia?
Stroke is the most common cause of homonymous hemianopia and accounts for 69.7% of cases.1
Other causes of hemianopia include:
            Brain injuries
Bleeding in the brain
Brain tumors
Infection in the brain
Multiple sclerosis
Alzheimer's disease 
Epilepsy
Invasive surgical procedures

How is Hemianopia Treated?
Hemianopia treatment is dependent on the underlying cause of the visual disturbance. The condition may correct itself over time with spontaneous recovery from a brain injury, stroke, or tumor removal.
Some cases of hemianopia may be permanent and need ongoing treatment to expand your visual world. 
These treatment options include:
Vision restoration therapy to help with reading and dealing with your environment
Visual rehabilitation to maximize the use of remaining vision and eye movement patterns
Visual assist devices, including prism glasses
Using a driving simulator to determine if you are safe to drive
Learning how to make quick eye and head movements toward the affected side
Use a straight edge to help direct your eyes when reading
Can You Recover from Hemianopia?
Visual recovery from hemianopia depends on the underlying cause of the blind side and your ability to heal from injury or illness.
Permanent loss of half of the visual fields can affect the quality of life, including:
Not being able to drive
Difficulty reading
Trouble moving around in your environment
Social isolation
Anxiety and depression 
Prevention tips
Prognosis
prognosis
Visual loss in the setting of stroke suggests a poor prognosis, with the rate of improvement ranging widely from 17% to 67%. Certain studies indicate that only 18% of patients with homonymous hemianopsia regain their vision within 28 to 30 days of the inciting event. In contrast, others report spontaneous improvement in 46% to 67% of cases within 1 month of an ischemic stroke.[36][37][38] The chances of visual recovery diminish over time, with the likelihood of regaining visual function notably low after 6 months.[27][39] 
Patients with bitemporal hemianopsia attributed to pituitary tumors typically experience visual field improvement in 79% to 95% of cases following resection. However, the extent of recovery may hinge on factors such as retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, preoperative deficit severity, duration of visual symptoms, tumor size, extent of resection, and patient age.[40]
A recent study explores the adaptation process of patients to post-stroke hemianopsia visual field loss by closely monitoring early-stage adaptation. The results highlight that adaptation to hemianopsia is individualized and influenced by factors such as the outcomes of a mobility assessment course (MAC) and the degree of inferior visual field loss. The authors recommend incorporating MAC as an assessment tool for evaluating mobility and scanning during rehabilitating patients with homonymous hemianopsia.

Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
epidemiology
The occurrence of hemianopsia varies depending on the underlying pathological condition. In adults, stroke stands out as the predominant cause, accounting for 69.7% of cases, with an average patient age of 58.Conversely, in children, neoplasms contribute to 39% of cases, cerebrovascular disease to 25%, and trauma to 19%. An extensive review involving 904 patients with homonymous hemianopsia highlights that stroke primarily affects the occipital lobe in 54% of patients, followed by involvement of the optic radiations in 33% and optic tracts in 6% of patients.
In non-stroke-related homonymous hemianopsia, damage can occur at various locations along the visual pathway. Specifically, 24% affect the occipital lobe, 31% impact the optic radiations, 19% involve the optic tract, and 25% affect multiple locations. Pituitary adenomas are the most frequently encountered cause of bitemporal hemianopsia. A systematic review based on radiographic and autopsy studies estimates the overall prevalence of pituitary tumors to be 16.7%.[20] Conversely, occlusive cerebrovascular disease or occipital infarction is identified as the most common cause of homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing

HORNER SYNDROME
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Horner’s syndrome is also known as “oculosympathetic paresis”, “Bernard-Horner syndromes (BH)”, and “oculosympathetic palsy”.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
Horner’s syndrome occurs as a result of a lesion along the oculo-sympathetic pathway. Clinical features include ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis, enophthalmos, and loss of ciliospinal reflex. Inverse ptosis (upside-down ptosis), a condition where the lower eyelid elevates due to underlying denervated tarsal muscle, may also be seen. It is worth noting that the enophthalmos in Horner syndrome is not a true enophthalmos. It results due to evident narrowing of vertical palpebral fissure height, producing an apparent sunken appearance of the globe. 
Prior knowledge of the sympathetic pathway is important to localize the lesion and understand the rationale behind the clinical presentation of Horner syndrome. 
The sympathetic pathway comprises a three–order neuronal chain. The first–order neuron arises from the posterolateral hypothalamus and synapses at the C8-T2 level in the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, also called the ciliospinal center of Budge. The second-order neurons now travel across the apex of the lung and along the sympathetic chain, ultimately synapsing at the level of the superior cervical ganglion. The third-order neurons (postganglionic fibers) travel with the internal carotid artery (ICA) through the cavernous sinus and then along the abducens nerve. It then follows the first division of the trigeminal nerve as the nasociliary nerve and later as the long ciliary nerves to supply the dilator pupillae. 
Anhidrosis is typically present in cases of central (1 order) or preganglionic (2 order) lesions. Although the classical clinical features are sufficient to diagnose Horner syndrome, several pharmacological tests are available to confirm a case of suspected Horner syndrome. 
Drug Mechanism of Action 
Anisocoria due to Horner syndrome associated with pain should be treated as an emergency warranting immediate recognition. The most important cause of a painful Horner’s syndrome is ICA dissection. 
Children with anisocoria must be evaluated for birth trauma. It is the most common cause of congenital Horner’s syndrome. If no evidence of trauma is found, a dedicated work-up to rule out neuroblastoma is mandated in children. Appropriate imaging, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) head, neck, chest, and abdomen, should be carried out for timely detection and appropriate management. 
Cholinergic Medications 
Cholinergic medications can cause miosis of the pupil through activation of the sphincter pupillae. The most common eye drop is pilocarpine, which has historically been used to treat glaucoma. 
Posterior Synechiae 
If posterior synechiae (abnormal connections between the iris and the lens) develop, the pupil may not be able to dilate fully. This can be caused by uveitis, angle-closure glaucoma, or other inflammatory conditions. The best way to evaluate for posterior synechiae is with a slit lamp examination. In this case, the underlying condition needs to be treated. 
CAUSES
Causes of Anisocoria Greater in Bright Light 
Third Nerve Palsy 
The parasympathetic fibers run along the periphery of the third nerve. Thus, compressive lesions of the third nerve would affect the parasympathetic fibers. This inhibits the signal to the sphincter pupillae, causing unopposed dilation of the pupil on the affected side. A third nerve palsy can be differentiated from other causes if the oculomotor component is affected. There would be significant ptosis of the affected upper eyelid due to inhibition to the levator palpebrae superioris. The eye would also be abducted and depressed, also known as "down and out." This is due to the unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique, which are the two extraocular muscles not innervated by the third cranial nerve. A very concerning compressive lesion would be an aneurysm, which can be acutely fatal.   
Migraine Headache 
A migraine headache can cause anisocoria associated with pain. The pupil will typically be dilated, and the dilation often resolves after the headache has subsided. 
Cycloplegic Medications 
Cycloplegic medications cause paralysis of the sphincter pupillae, which in turn causes unopposed dilation. This pupil will, at most, minimally constrict with light and, much of the time, will not react at all due to paralysis. Pilocarpine will not be effective in causing this pupil to constrict. Cycloplegic eye drops include cyclopentolate, atropine, and tropicamide. The same effect can be achieved if a patient touches an anticholinergic medication and then touches the eye. Getting a history of cycloplegic medication use is the best way to make this diagnosis. 
Sympathomimetics 
Eye drops that cause activation of the dilator pupillae can cause mydriasis of the pupil. There still should be some reactivity of the pupil. The dilation is not as great as with cycloplegic medications. 
Adie Tonic Pupil 
In this condition, the larger pupil fails to constrict to the extent of the other pupil. However, when the eye accommodates, the pupil has greater constriction. This cause of anisocoria can be diagnosed with dilute pilocarpine, which causes significant constriction of the larger pupil. Other causes of a dilated pupil typically do not respond to dilute pilocarpine, helping confirm the diagnosis of Adie tonic pupil. 
Traumatic Mydriasis 
Damage to the pupillary sphincter due to trauma or intraocular surgery may leave the pupil dilated and potentially with an irregular shape. The pupil may then be unable to constrict. The best way to diagnose traumatic mydriasis is to get a complete history of ocular trauma and eye surgeries and then perform a slit lamp exam. Mydriasis due to trauma may improve over time or remain permanent. An irregular pupil after intraocular surgery has a higher likelihood of remaining permanent. 
Causes of Anisocoria that is Equal in Bright and Dim Light Conditions 
Physiological Anisocoria 
Physiologic anisocoria is usually defined as a pupillary inequality of 0.4 mm, seldom greater than 0.8 mm, not due to a secondary cause. If the anisocoria is physiologic, the difference in pupil sizes should remain equal in dim and bright lights. This also should be something that a patient has had for a long time and has not acutely changed. The difference in pupil size in physiologic anisocoria remains stable over time and is not a concern for an underlying medical condition.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
Anisocoria itself is unlikely to cause significant complications, although some do exist. A larger pupil may cause light sensitivity and visual aberrations. A smaller pupil may cause worsened visualization through a cataract, difficulty viewing the fundus during the posterior exam, or difficulty in cataract surgery. The main complication of anisocoria is not the difference in pupil size but the complications of the underlying condition itself.

KERATITIS
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Another name for keratitis is “ulcerative keratitis”, which refers to an inflammation or irritation of the cornea that can lead to an ulcer.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
Bacterial keratitis is an eye infection that affects the cornea. The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped window of the front of your eye. 
Bacterial keratitis usually develops quickly. Left untreated it can cause blindness. 
There are many different bacteria that cause keratitis. The two bacteria most commonly responsible for this type of infection in the U.S. are: 
Staphylococcus aureus 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea — the clear, dome-shaped tissue on the front of your eye that covers the pupil and iris. Keratitis may or may not be associated with an infection. Noninfectious keratitis can be caused by a relatively minor injury, such as from wearing your contact lenses too long or getting a foreign body in the eye. Infectious keratitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. 
If you have eye redness or other symptoms of keratitis, make an appointment to see an eye specialist. With prompt attention, mild to moderate cases of keratitis can usually be effectively treated without loss of vision. If left untreated, or if an infection is severe, keratitis can lead to serious complications that may permanently damage your vision. 
CAUSES
Causes of keratitis include: 
Injury. If any object scratches or injures the surface of your cornea, noninfectious keratitis may result. In addition, an injury may allow microorganisms to gain access to the damaged cornea, causing infectious keratitis. 
Bacteria, fungi or parasites. These organisms may live on the surface of a contact lens or contact lens carrying case. The cornea may become contaminated when the lens is in your eye, resulting in infectious keratitis. Poor contact lens hygiene or contact lens overwear can cause both noninfectious and infectious keratitis. 
Viruses. The herpes viruses — herpes simplex and herpes zoster — may cause keratitis. 
Bacteria. Staphylococcus, streptococcus and pseudomonas are common bacteria involved in keratitis. 
Contaminated water. Bacteria, fungi and parasites in water — particularly in oceans, rivers, lakes and hot tubs — can enter your eyes when you're swimming and result in keratitis. However, even if you're exposed to these organisms, a healthy cornea is unlikely to become infected unless there has been some previous breakdown of the corneal surface — for example, from wearing a contact lens too long. 
 What Causes Bacterial Keratitis? 
The two main causes of bacterial keratitis are: 
contact lens use, especially extended-wear lenses 
eye injury 
You risk infection from contact lenses if you wear them too long or do not take care of them correctly. Proper care of your contacts will lower your risk of developing a corneal infection. 
RISK FACTORS
Factors that may increase your risk of keratitis include: 
Contact lenses. Wearing contact lenses — especially sleeping in the lenses —increases your risk of both infectious and noninfectious keratitis. The risk typically stems from wearing them longer than recommended, improper disinfection or wearing contact lenses while swimming. 
Keratitis is more common in people who use extended-wear contacts, or wear contacts continuously, than in those who use daily wear contacts and take them out at night. 
Reduced immunity. If your immune system is weakened due to disease or medications, you're at higher risk of developing keratitis. 
Corticosteroids. Use of corticosteroid eye drops to treat an eye disorder can increase your risk of developing infectious keratitis or make existing keratitis worse. 
Eye injury. If one of your corneas has been damaged from an injury in the past, you may be more vulnerable to developing keratitis. 

SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
Symptoms of keratitis include: 
Eye redness 
Eye pain 
Excess tears or other discharge from your eye 
Difficulty opening your eyelid because of pain or irritation 
Blurred vision 
Decreased vision 
Sensitivity to light, called photophobia 
A feeling that something is in your eye 
 Bacterial Keratitis Symptoms 
Symptoms of bacterial keratitis may include: 
pain in the eye (often sudden) 
unusual eye redness 
reduced vision 
increased light sensitivity 
excessive tearing 
discharge from your eye 
Call your ophthalmologist right away if you have any of these symptoms. This is especially important if they come on suddenly. If not treated, a bacterial keratitis eye infection can lead to blindness. Treatment must start right away to prevent vision loss. 
BACTERIAL KERATITIS DIAGNOSIS METHODS
To diagnose bacterial keratitis, your ophthalmologist will discuss your symptoms with you. They may gently scrape the eye to take a small sample and test it for infection. 
Bacterial keratitis is usually treated with antibiotic eye drops. Drops are usually put in frequently. Treatment may also involve steroid drops. You may need to return to your ophthalmologist several times. 
If you and your ophthalmologist find and treat bacterial keratitis early, you may preserve your vision. In severe cases, decreased vision or blindness may be the result. This is also true if the infection affects the center of the cornea. Sometimes a cornea transplant or specialized contact lens is needed to restore vision. 

DIAGNOSIS METHOD
Diagnosing keratitis typically involves the following: 
Eye exam. Although it may be uncomfortable to open your eyes for the exam, it's important to have your eye care provider examine your eyes. 
Penlight exam. Your eye doctor may examine your eye using a penlight, to check your pupil's reaction, size and other factors. A stain may be applied to the surface of your eye. Used with the light, this stain makes it easier to see damage to the surface of the cornea. 
Slit-lamp exam. Your eye care provider will examine your eyes with a special instrument called a slit lamp. It provides a bright source of light and magnification to detect the character and extent of keratitis, as well as the effect it may have on other structures of the eye. 
Laboratory analysis. Your eye care provider may take a sample of tears or some cells from your cornea for laboratory analysis to determine the cause of keratitis and to help develop a treatment plan for you. 

TREATMENT OPTIONS
Noninfectious keratitis 
Treatment of noninfectious keratitis varies depending on the severity. For example, with mild discomfort from a corneal scratch, artificial tear drops may be the only treatment. However, if keratitis is causing significant tearing and pain, topical eye medications may be necessary. 
Infectious keratitis 
Treatment of infectious keratitis varies, depending on the cause of the infection. 
Bacterial keratitis. Antibiotic eye drops are the primary treatment for bacterial keratitis. Depending on the severity of the infection, drop frequency can range from around four times a day to every 30 minutes, even during the night. Sometimes oral antibiotics are used as a supplement. 
Fungal keratitis. Keratitis caused by fungi typically requires antifungal eye drops and oral antifungal medication. 
Viral keratitis. If a virus is causing the infection, antiviral eye drops and oral antiviral medications may be effective. Other viruses need only supportive care such as artificial tear drops. 
Acanthamoeba keratitis. Keratitis caused by the parasite acanthamoeba can be difficult to treat. Antiparasitic eye drops are used, but some acanthamoeba infections are resistant to medication and can require treatment for several months. Severe cases of acanthamoeba keratitis may require a cornea transplant. Acanthamoeba causes keratitis, a sight-threatening, painful, and difficult-to-treat ocular infection that is linked to contact-lens wear. 1 The pathogen can also cause infections of the CNS and skin, which are associated with immunodeficiency, 2 although these types of infection are less common than keratitis.
If keratitis doesn't respond to medication, or if it causes permanent damage to the cornea that significantly impairs your vision, your eye care provider may recommend a cornea transplant. 
PREVENTION TIPS
Caring for your contact lenses 
If you wear contact lenses, proper use, cleaning and disinfecting can help prevent keratitis. Follow these tips: 
Choose daily wear contacts and take them out before going to sleep. 
Wash, rinse and dry your hands thoroughly before handling your contacts. 
Follow your eye care provider's recommendations for taking care of your lenses. 
Use only sterile products that are made specifically for contact lens care, and use lens care products made for the type of lenses you wear. 
Replace your contact lenses as recommended. 
Replace your contact lens case every 3 to 6 months. 
Discard the solution in the contact lens case each time you disinfect your lenses. Don't "top off" the old solution that's already in the case. 
Don't wear contact lenses when you go swimming. 
Preventing viral outbreaks 
Some forms of viral keratitis can't be eliminated. But the following steps may control viral keratitis occurrences: 
If you have a cold sore or a herpes blister, avoid touching your eyes, your eyelids and the skin around your eyes unless you've thoroughly washed your hands. 
Only use eye drops that have been prescribed by an eye doctor. 
Washing your hands frequently can reduce viral outbreaks.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
The incidence and prevalence of bacterial keratitis vary with the geographical location and local environmental and climatic risk factors. There is a vast disparity among populations in the incidence of bacterial keratitis in developed countries like the USA and Europe compared to developing countries like India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This variation is because less industrialized nations have a significantly lower frequency of contact lens users. As a result, contact lens-related bacterial keratitis is also less. 
In the USA, the reported incidence is 11/1 lakh users compared to Nepal with 799/1 lakh users. The annual incidence of microbial keratitis in the USA is 71,000 cases. The normal human eye rarely develops bacterial keratitis because the normal human cornea is resistant to infection. In a study by Ormerod et al. in North America, they described staphylococcal, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus as the major causes of microbial keratitis. Neuman and Sjostrand, in their analysis, reported Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas as the most common gram-negative bacteria. 
The incidence of corneal ulcers has progressed from nearly zero in early 60 to 52% in the 1990s. Erie et al. also reported that the incidence of ulcerative keratitis rapidly progressed from 5.3 to 435% from 1950 to 1980. He concluded contact lens to be a significant contributor. The reported annual incidence of ulcerative keratitis in contact lens users is 4 to 21 per 10,000 extended wear and daily wear for soft contact lens wearers. The overall most common reported causes of bacterial keratitis are Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In studies from Italy and UK contact lens was found to be a more common predisposing risk factor for bacterial keratitis. Data from two hospital sets from Los Angeles reported gram-positive pathogens. 
A two hospital analysis from Los Angeles, USA, reported coagulase-negative staphylococcus as the most common gram-positive pathogens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the most common gram-negative bacteria. Another analysis from the USA reported more prevalence of gram-negative organisms from the southern USA than the northern part of the country. A study from Texas reported gram-negative bacteria as the most common isolate. 
Polymicrobial keratitis can also occur while analyzing culture. A study reported 43% of cultures having two or more bacterial microorganisms. Staph. epidermidis and Fusarium have been reported as the most common etiology for polymicrobial keratitis, with trauma being the most common risk factor. The Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT) from South India reported 51.5% cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 22.75 cases of Pseudomonas, and 11.5% cases of Nocardia.

KERATOCONUS
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Keratoconus (ker-uh-toe-KOH-nus) is an eye condition in which the clear, dome-shaped front of the eye, called the cornea, gets thinner, steeper and bulges outward into a cone shape.
A cone-shaped cornea causes blurred vision and may cause sensitivity to light and glare. Keratoconus usually affects both eyes. However, it can affect one eye more than the other. It generally begins to affect people between the late teens and 30 years of age. The condition may progress slowly for 10 years or longer.
In the early stages of keratoconus, you might be able to correct vision problems with glasses or soft contact lenses. Later, you may have to be fitted with rigid, gas permeable contact lenses or other types of lenses, such as scleral lenses. If your condition gets worse, you may need a cornea transplant.
A procedure called corneal collagen cross-linking may help to slow or stop keratoconus from progressing, possibly preventing the need for a future cornea transplant. This treatment may be offered in addition to the vision correction options above.
Causes
No one knows what causes keratoconus, although genetic and environmental factors are thought to be involved. Around 1 in 10 people with keratoconus also have a parent with the condition.
Risk factors
These factors can increase the risk of developing keratoconus:
Having a family history of keratoconus.
Rubbing the eyes vigorously.
Having certain conditions, such as retinitis pigmentosa, Down syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, hay fever and asthma.
Symptoms
Symptoms of keratoconus may change as the disease progresses. They include:
Blurred or distorted vision.
Increased sensitivity to bright light and glare, which can cause problems with night driving.
A need for frequent changes in eyeglass prescriptions.
Sudden worsening or clouding of vision.

Diagnosis
To diagnose keratoconus, an eye doctor will review a medical and family history and do an eye exam. Other tests also may be done to find out more about the shape of the cornea.
Tests to diagnose keratoconus include:
Eye refraction. This test uses special equipment that measures the eyes. It may involve looking through a device that contains wheels of different lenses, called a phoropter. This device helps judge which combination offers the sharpest vision. Some eye doctors may use a hand-held instrument called a retinoscope to check the eyes.
Slit-lamp examination. This test involves directing a vertical beam of light on the surface of the eye and using a low-powered microscope to view the eye. The eye doctor evaluates the shape of the cornea and looks for other potential problems in the eye.
Keratometry. This exam involves focusing a circle of light on the cornea and measures the reflection. This determines the basic shape of the cornea.
Computerized corneal mapping. Special photographic tests, such as corneal tomography and corneal topography, record images to create a detailed shape map of the cornea. Corneal tomography also can measure the thickness of the cornea. This type of testing can often detect early signs of keratoconus before the disease is visible by slit-lamp examination.
Treatment
Treatment for keratoconus depends on the severity of the condition and how quickly the condition is progressing. Generally, there are two approaches to treating keratoconus: slowing the progression of the disease and improving vision.
If keratoconus is progressing, corneal collagen cross-linking may be recommended to slow it or stop it from getting worse. This treatment aims to stabilize the structure of the cornea. It may decrease the bulging of the cornea and help achieve better vision with glasses or contact lenses. This treatment also has the potential to prevent needing a cornea transplant in the future.
Improving vision depends on the severity of keratoconus. Mild to moderate keratoconus can be treated with eyeglasses or contact lenses. This will likely be a long-term treatment, especially if the cornea becomes stable with time or from cross-linking.
In some people with keratoconus, the cornea becomes scarred with advanced disease. For others, wearing contact lenses becomes difficult. In these people, cornea transplant surgery might be necessary.
Lenses
Eyeglasses or soft contact lenses. Glasses or soft contact lenses can correct blurry or distorted vision in early keratoconus. But people often need to change their prescription for eyeglasses or contacts as the shape of their corneas change.
Hard contact lenses. Hard contact lenses are often the next step in treating more advanced keratoconus. Hard lenses include rigid, gas permeable types. Hard lenses may feel uncomfortable at first, but many people adjust to wearing them and they can provide excellent vision. This type of lens can be made to fit the corneas.
Piggyback lenses. If rigid lenses are uncomfortable, an eye doctor may recommend "piggybacking" a hard contact lens on top of a soft one.
Hybrid lenses. These contact lenses have a rigid center with a softer ring around the outside for increased comfort. People who can't tolerate hard contact lenses may prefer hybrid lenses.
Scleral lenses. These lenses are useful for very irregular shape changes in the cornea in advanced keratoconus. Instead of resting on the cornea like traditional contact lenses do, scleral lenses sit on the white part of the eye, called the sclera, and vault over the cornea without touching it.
If you're using rigid or scleral contact lenses, make sure to have them fitted by an eye doctor with experience in treating keratoconus. You'll also need to have regular checkups to determine whether the lenses still fit well. An ill-fitting lens can damage the cornea.
Therapies
Corneal cross-linking. In this procedure, the cornea is saturated with riboflavin eye drops and treated with ultraviolet light. This causes cross-linking of the cornea, which stiffens the cornea to prevent further shape changes. Corneal cross-linking may help to reduce the risk of progressive vision loss by stabilizing the cornea early in the disease.
Surgery
Surgery may be necessary if there is corneal scarring, extreme thinning of the cornea, poor vision with the strongest prescription lenses or an inability to wear any type of contact lenses.
Depending on the location of the bulging cone and the severity of the condition, surgical options include:
Intrastromal corneal ring segments (ICRS). For mild to moderate keratoconus, an eye doctor may recommend inserting small synthetic rings in the cornea. This treatment can help flatten the cornea, which can help improve vision and make contact lenses fit better. Sometimes this procedure is done in combination with corneal cross-linking.
Cornea transplant. If there is corneal scarring or extreme thinning, a cornea transplant may be needed. Depending on the situation, an eye doctor may recommend replacing all or part of the cornea with healthy donor tissue. A cornea transplant is known as a keratoplasty.
Cornea transplant for keratoconus generally is very successful. Possible complications include graft rejection, poor vision, infection and astigmatism. Astigmatism is often managed by wearing hard contact lenses again, which is usually more comfortable after a cornea transplant.
Prevention tips
Prognosis
Possible complications
In some situations, the cornea may swell quickly and cause sudden reduced vision and scarring of the cornea. This is caused by a condition in which the inside lining of the cornea, called Descemet's membrane, breaks down. This causes fluid to enter the cornea, a condition known as hydrops. The swelling usually goes down by itself, but a scar may form that affects vision.
Advanced keratoconus also may cause the cornea to become scarred, particularly where the cone is most prominent. A scarred cornea causes worsening vision problems and may require cornea transplant surgery.
When to see a doctor
See your eye doctor if your eyesight is worsening rapidly. This might be caused by an irregular curvature of the eye, called astigmatism. Your eye doctor also may look for signs of keratoconus during routine eye exams.
Differential Diagnosis
The potential differential diagnoses for keratoconus include various conditions, including contact lens complications, contact lens—induced corneal warpage, corneal ectasia, ectasia due to refractive surgery, diplopia, interstitial keratitis, keratoglobus, pellucid marginal degeneration, posterior keratoconus, Terrien marginal degeneration, and corneal scarring. Congenital disorders such as congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, other corneal dystrophies such as Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, and infectious or non-infectious keratitis are also included in the potential differential diagnoses for keratoconus.
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Keratoconus typically manifests during adolescence or early adulthood, progressing into the fourth decade of life. The prevalence of the condition in the general population varies between 50 and 230 per 100,000 individuals. A recent meta-analysis involving over 7 million lives across 15 countries reports a prevalence of approximately 138 per 100,000 individuals. Specific gender predilection does not exist. Although some studies suggest a higher incidence among individuals of Asian descent from the Indian subcontinent, others do not support this observation. Notably, Black and Latino patients appear to have a 50% higher likelihood of developing keratoconus compared to White patients.
More specific and sensitive diagnostic tools now allow for the detection of subtle cases of keratoconus. New international studies suggest a prevalence as high as 1 in 375 in some populations. Within medical investigations conducted in hospitals and clinics, the occurrence of keratoconus is notably high in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabian adolescents, where it reaches 4790 cases per 100,000 individuals.
A positive family history or familial transmission is evident in at least 6% to 8% of reported cases. Among individuals with Down syndrome, the incidence of keratoconus ranges from 0.5% to 15%. Additionally, keratoconus is prevalent in up to 30% of individuals aged 15 and above with Leber congenital amaurosis and in 58% of patients with mitral valve prolapse

LOW VISION
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Low vision is a permanent visual impairment that you can’t correct with glasses, contacts or surgery. Most eye doctors define low vision as moderate to severe visual impairment — enough to inhibit your everyday activities, like driving and reading.
Terms like “partially sighted” and “legally blind” fall under the larger heading of low vision. But these terms also have more specific meanings. In the U.S., these refer to whether you qualify for special education or disability services for visual impairment.
Low vision may involve a variety of different types of visual impairment; not just nearsightedness or farsightedness, but also peripheral vision loss, a blind spot or blurred vision. You might have OK vision in some ways but still have low vision overall.
Low vision isn’t total blindness — some vision remains. Vision rehabilitation services help people with low vision make the most of what they’ve got. A specialist can help connect you with low vision aids and assistive technology to make your life easier.
What qualifies as low vision on a visual acuity test?
The standard visual acuity test in the U.S. is the Snellen eye chart. It measures the clarity of your vision at a distance of 20 feet from an object. If you have 20/20 vision, which is the average score, it means you can see an object clearly from 20 feet away.
If your score is 20/70, it means that your vision at 20 feet is like normal vision at 70 feet. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies this score as moderate visual impairment or moderate low vision. A score of 20/200 or above qualifies as severe low vision.
But this isn’t the only score eye specialists consider. Other types of tests measure other aspects of your vision. For example, a visual field test measures your range of vision from side to side. Having a visual field of 20 degrees or less also qualifies as low vision.
Some people have low scores on vision tests, but they’re able to correct their impairment with glasses, contacts or surgery. If these treatments make your test scores go up, you don’t have low vision. Low vision is a condition you have even with your glasses on.
Causes 
What causes low vision?
Causes of low vision include acquired diseases, injuries and congenital (birth) defects.
Some of the most common causes include:
Macular degeneration. This condition causes a gradual loss of central vision. You might develop a blurry or blind spot in your central visual field. It commonly affects people older than 50.
Cataracts. Cataracts are another common age-related eye condition. A cataract is a cloud on your eye lens. Cataract surgery can often remove it, but not everyone is a candidate for surgery.
Glaucoma. Glaucoma is a progressive condition that damages your optic nerve. It usually affects your peripheral vision and night vision first. Without treatment, it can do irreversible damage.
Diabetes-related retinopathy. This condition causes blood vessels in your eye to leak fluids, which build pressure against your retina and damage it over time. It’s a complication of diabetes.
Retinopathy of prematurity. Babies born preterm and treated with incubation can develop abnormal blood vessels in their retinas. In a minority of cases, these can cause lasting damage.
Amblyopia (lazy eye). Amblyopia is a congenital defect that causes blurry vision in one eye. As your child’s brain relies more on the good eye and ignores the bad eye, that eye begins to drift.
Other causes include:
Refractive errors. Refractive errors affect the shape of your eye, causing nearsightedness or farsightedness. They’re correctable, but if they go untreated, they’ll continue to worsen.
Trachoma. Trachoma is a bacterial infection that can irritate and damage your eyes. It’s a leading cause of vision loss and blindness worldwide, especially in less developed countries.
Strabismus (misaligned eyes). Strabismus is a problem with the muscles that control your eye movements and eye alignment. It usually begins to appear in infancy or early childhood.
Nystagmus. This condition causes rapid, uncontrollable eye movements that may make it impossible to focus your vision. It can be present at birth or acquired later in adulthood.
Retinitis pigmentosa. Retinitis pigmentosa describes a group of inherited eye diseases that prevent your retina from working properly. Different genetic mutations can cause it.
Hypertensive retinopathy. Chronic high blood pressure can disrupt the blood flow to your organs, including your retinas. Vision loss may be your first symptom of blood flow problems.
Retinal detachment. This painless but serious condition causes your retina to detach from the tissues that support it, losing its blood supply. It can cause sudden and permanent vision loss.
Optic atrophy. Optic atrophy causes your optic nerve to gradually deteriorate (waste away). A variety of conditions can cause it, including injuries, infections and blood flow problems.
Eye injuries. A traumatic injury to your eye can cause lasting damage, especially if it isn’t recognized or treated right away. Pay attention if you have vision problems after an injury.
Brain injuries. A traumatic head injury or stroke may cause brain damage that affects your vision. You might notice vision problems along with symptoms like headaches and dizziness.
Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is crucial to your vision. If you don’t get enough from your diet, or your body can’t absorb enough, it can cause vision loss. Night blindness is the first symptom.
Eye cancer. All forms of eye cancer are very rare, but they can cause vision loss. Treatments to remove eye cancer can also cause vision loss, either by damaging or removing parts of your eye.
and risk factors
Signs and symptoms
What are the signs and symptoms of low vision?
Low vision can manifest in different ways for different people.
You might have a loss of:
Central vision: The ability to see what’s directly in front of you.
Peripheral vision: The ability to see out of the sides of your eyes.
Depth perception: The ability to judge the distance between objects.
Contrast sensitivity: The ability to distinguish objects in the foreground from objects of the same shade in the background.
Night vision: The ability to see at night or in low light.
Glare resistance: The ability to function in bright light.
You might have difficulties with:
Reading.
Driving.
Cooking.
Classroom learning.
Watching TV or videos.
Using a computer.
Recognizing people’s faces.
Getting around, especially in unfamiliar places.
Signs of low vision in children might include:
Frequently bumping into things.
Holding objects very close to their face.
Frequent squinting or blinking.
Frequently shutting or covering one eye.
Eyes that flutter or dance.
Eyes that don’t point the same way.
Pupils of different sizes.
Pupils that look gray or white.
Side effects of permanent vision impairment can include:
Reduced physical and social activity.
Loss of independence or employment.
Hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome).
Anxiety or depression.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
How is low vision diagnosed?
An ophthalmologist can diagnose your visual impairment, using a variety of vision tests. They’ll tell you what the issue is, how severe it is and if it’s treatable or not. If it’s moderate to severe, irreversible and significantly impacts your life, they’ll diagnose low vision.
Receiving this diagnosis can be difficult, especially if you weren’t aware that you were at risk of irreversible vision loss. You’ll probably have a series of reactions, from shock and bewilderment to numbness, denial, anger or grief. These are all natural reactions.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
How do eye specialists treat low vision?
When you see an optometrist specializing in low vision, they’ll give you a special kind of exam called a low vision exam. They’ll begin by taking a complete history of your eye health, and then ask about how your condition is currently affecting your life.
They’ll ask you how low vision affects your:
School or work.
Reading and computer use.
Driving.
Functioning in the kitchen.
Facial recognition.
Ability to travel.
Hobbies and leisure activities.
Mood and social life.
The provider will also examine your eyes and vision to look for any changes in your condition. They’ll use special low vision test charts to evaluate your visual acuity.
They might also need to check your:
Field of vision.
Eye muscle function.
Glare sensitivity.
Contrast sensitivity.
Night vision.
Color vision.
Depth perception.
Reading ability.
Based on the results of your exam, a low vision specialist will design a personalized treatment plan that addresses your specific difficulties and needs. They’ll offer resources and recommendations to help you adapt and optimize your quality of life.
Vision rehabilitation
Treatment for low vision is called vision rehabilitation. The goal of the treatment is to maximize your vision as much as possible and otherwise help you live as independently as possible with the vision you have. This may involve a wide variety of resources.
Your plan might include:
Low vision aids and devices
You might benefit from:
A prescription for glasses or contact lenses.
Optical magnifiers or telescopes.
Electronic magnifiers and screen readers.
Large print and high contrast products.
Voice-to-text and audio reading technology.
Audible home devices.
Practical training and support
You might also benefit from:
Occupational therapy to learn new ways to perform tasks.
A mobility specialist to help you learn to get around.
A rehabilitation instructor to teach you independent living skills.
Special education or vocational services.
Counseling or psychotherapy to maintain your mental health.
Support groups that connect you with others living with low vision.
Prevention
Can I prevent permanent vision loss?
The best way to prevent permanent vision loss is to keep up with your regular eye exams and see your provider right away if you notice anything unusual. While not all causes of low vision are preventable, many are treatable if you catch them early enough.
Outlook / Prognosis
How will I cope with low vision?
Not everyone with low vision bothers with rehabilitation services, but most people could benefit a lot from them. From practical tools, tips and tricks to social and emotional support systems, there’s a wealth of resources out there to take advantage of.
Adapting to a disability isn’t easy, but it’s easier if you don’t try to do it alone. Remember, no matter what your challenges are, someone else out there has already faced them. Others have found solutions and ways of coping that they can pass on to you.
Living With
Can I receive disability benefits for low vision?
You may be eligible for disability benefits, based on your specific diagnosis, your financial position and other factors. Different governments have different criteria for receiving benefits. Specialists on your visual rehabilitation team can help you apply.

Macular edema, hole, and pucker
MACULAR TELANGIECTASIAN (MACTEL)
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Macular telangiectasia (MacTel) is a disease that affects the macula, causing central vision loss. It’s caused by abnormal blood vessels around the fovea. The fovea is the centre of the macula and is used for detailed central vision.
There are two main types of macular telangiectasia – type 1 and type 2. The blood vessel changes are different in each type.
Type 1 macular telangiectasia
In Type 1 macular telangiectasia, the blood vessels are dilated (enlarged) and aneurysms (or bulging of blood vessels) form. This causes swelling and damage to the macula. It usually occurs in one eye only and is believed to be a variation of Coats disease. Coats disease is a rare retinal disorder that most often impacts young people.
Type 2 macular telangiectasia
Type 2 is the most common form of macular telangiectasia. In Type 2, the blood vessels dilate (enlarge) and leak, causing swelling of the macula. Sometimes new blood vessels can form under the retina and also break or leak. Eventually, scarring over the macula can occur, severely affecting vision. This type of MacTel usually occurs in both eyes but can affect each eye differently.
Type 2 macular telangiectasia is typically diagnosed in people aged in their 40s and 50s. People with macular telangiectasia tend to have a higher prevalence of diabetes and high blood pressure.
Symptoms of MacTel
In its early stages, people with macular telangiectasia may not have symptoms. As the disease progresses over 10 to 20 years, there may be blurriness and distortion of central vision depending on the severity of the disease. Side or peripheral vision is usually unaffected. 
How is MacTel diagnosed?
Signs of macular telangiectasia can be detected during a comprehensive eye examination by your optometrist or ophthalmologist. Your eye health professional may do further tests such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA) to confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
Unfortunately, there’s currently no effective treatment for macular telangiectasia.
In cases where new blood vessels have formed under the retina, your eye health professional may suggest injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) into your eye to help prevent further vision loss.
Prevention tips
Prognosis
According to the Mac Tel Project, 60% of type 2 patients have a VA of 20/50 or better, with a mean VA of 20/40. Mac Tel can rarely lead to 20/200 or worse vision, especially when associated with full-thickness macular hole or retinal neovascularization associated with disciform scaring. However, about 79% of eyes with neovascularization and about 78% of eyes with macular hole have VA better than 20/200. Interestingly, eyes with VA 20/200 or worse (consider to be advanced disease) were reported to have pigmentary plaques, which are thought to be surrogate markers for photoreceptor degeneration.
Possible complications
When to see a doctor / red flag
Differential Diagnosis
Differential diagnoses of retinal capillary telangiectasia include branch retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, and radiation retinopathy. In cases of neovascularization, age-related macular degeneration should also be ruled out.
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
Management
There have been no randomized clinical studies in Mac Tel. In non-neovascular cases, laser therapy, intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections, and corticosteroids have all been shown to not be effective in controlling the disease. For neovascular cases, intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are the mainstay of treatment, although transpupillary therapy and photodynamic therapy have been used in the past.
Neuroprotective agents are currently under investigation for the treatment of Mac Tel type 2. A phase 2 trial found decreased ellipsoid zone loss, increased macular thickness, and stable reading speed with intraocular delivery of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). The phase 3 multicenter Renexus (NT-501) trial compared the safety and efficacy of an intravitreal ocular implant designed to deliver therapeutic doses of CNTF vs sham treatment. 
Associated full-thickness macular holes may be treated with pars plana vitrectomy surgery, membrane peeling, and gas tamponade, but these procedures may have lower-than-average closure rates and corresponding postoperative VA.
If possible, include statistics or epidemiology data (e.g., how common it is, affected demographics).

Meesmann corneal dystrophy
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
THIS is an eye disease that affects the cornea, which is the clear front covering of the eye. This condition is characterized by the formation of tiny round cysts in the outermost layer of the cornea, called the corneal epithelium. This part of the cornea acts as a barrier to help prevent foreign materials, such as dust and bacteria, from entering the eye.
In people with Meesmann corneal dystrophy, cysts can appear as early as the first year of life. They usually affect both eyes and increase in number over time. The cysts usually do not cause any symptoms until late adolescence or adulthood, when they start to break open (rupture) on the surface of the cornea and cause irritation. The resulting symptoms typically include increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), twitching of the eyelids (blepharospasm), increased tear production, the sensation of having a foreign object in the eye, and an inability to tolerate wearing contact lenses. Some affected individuals also have temporary episodes of blurred vision.
other names
Corneal dystrophy, juvenile epithelial of Meesmann
Corneal dystrophy, Meesmann epithelial
Juvenile hereditary epithelial dystrophy
MECD
Meesman's corneal dystrophy
Meesmann corneal epithelial dystrophy
Meesmann epithelial corneal dystrophy
Causes
 Meesmann corneal dystrophy can result from mutations in either the KRT12 gene or the KRT3 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called keratin 12 and keratin 3, which are found in the corneal epithelium. The two proteins interact to form the structural framework of this layer of the cornea. Mutations in either the KRT12 or KRT3 gene weaken this framework, causing the corneal epithelium to become fragile and to develop the cysts that characterize the disorder. The cysts likely contain clumps of abnormal keratin proteins and other cellular debris. When the cysts rupture, they cause eye irritation and the other symptoms of Meesmann corneal dystrophy
and risk factors
Signs and symptoms
Signs
Myriads of intraepithelial microcysts most prominently in the interpalpebral zone
Round-to-oval shaped punctate opacities in the central corneal epithelium
Recurrent corneal erosions
Reduced corneal sensitivity
Smooth corneal surface
Symptoms
Decreased visual acuity (usually minor)
Foreign body sensation
Photophobia
Lacrimation
Temporary episodes of blurred vision
Eye stinging
Blepharospasm
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Diagnosis
Although the presence of intraepithelial cysts becomes evident in the ﬁrst decade of life, the vast majority of patients tend to remain asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms that often go unnoticed until late adolescence or adulthood. Affected individuals are therefore often diagnosed incidentally during a routine ophthalmic examination. Overall, the disorder does not cause much discomfort or significant vision disturbances and symptoms are usually mild and include recurrent irritation and decrease in visual acuity. The first presented symptom is ocular irritation linked to recurrent corneal erosions such as photophobia, pain, foreign body sensation, and excessive tearing, particularly upon lid-opening during sleep or upon awaking. The second symptom that follows is blurred vision as a result of corneal clouding
Clinical Diagnosis
Slit-lamp examination in direct and indirect illumination, retroillumination, fluorescein staining, preferably with dilated pupil.
Diagnostic Procedures
Slit-lamp examination in direct illumination: the lesions appear as a variety of different patterns (random, whirled, sectorial, interpalpebral or unilateral and sparing the perilimbal region) of multiple tiny grey dot-like opacities and tiny vesicles in the corneal epithelium, that tend to concentrate in the interpalpebral zone.Fluorescein usually fails to stain the microcysts, as they rarely open to the corneal surface.
Slit-lamp examination in indirect illumination: the grey opacities appear as multiple solitary, round, and transparent cysts, rarely producing refractile lines due to a coalescence of several cysts, while the intervening cornea remains intact or slightly hazy.
Retroillumination: the intraepithelial microcysts appear as refractile transparent dew drops and the vesicles present isolated. The characteristic bleb pattern of Meesmann corneal dystrophy can be best seen upon retroillumination
Corneal elevation topography: marked irregularity of Placido rings
In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM): the microcysts present as hyporeflective, round-oval, or teardrop areas in the basal epithelial cell layer. The peculiar substance appears as reflective spots.
Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy and Photography: documentation of the biomicroscopic examination with photos is useful as the disease progresses.

Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management
General treatment
Meesmann dystrophy is a genetic disorder that persists throughout life.MECD usually remains an entirely asymptomatic condition that requires no treatment. For patients who experience minor intermittent symptoms of ocular irritation, a conservative therapeutic approach largely aimed at symptoms is preferred. In rare cases of severe symptomatology or recurrent episodes of corneal erosions, surgical interventions may be required to prolong the reoccurrence of the disorder, and also lessen its severity.
Medical therapy
Mild to moderate symptoms and MECD-associated chronic eye dryness can be treated by using lubricating eye drops during the daytime and gel/ointment at night, but the majority of patients do not usually require further treatment. Some physicians advocate the use of topical steroids to increase the stability of the epithelial basement membrane, while others prefer hypertonic saline, especially in gel or ointment form at night, which causes dehydration of the epithelium and promotes its attachment to the underlying layers.  Patching, either conventional or using a bandage soft contact lens, can be beneficial as it minimizes the mechanical effect of lid movement on the irregular corneal epithelium.
Surgery
A more severe phenotype of MECD, described by recurrent corneal erosions and secondary scarring, can complicate the clinical presentation of MECD and conservative therapy often proves to be unsuccessful. Surgical treatment options aim at the removal of the pathological corneal epithelium and include superficial corneal debridement, superficial keratectomy with or without mitomycin C, phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), lamellar keratoplasty, and penetrating keratoplasty. Although the dystrophy frequently recurs after any of these treatments, in some cases recurrence may be less severe, delayed, or not occur.
Superficial Mechanical Debridement of the epithelium can be useful in the management of RCE, but is usually followed by reappearance of symptoms.
Superficial Keratectomy is a safe technique for managing corneal erosions and although it may be curative, it is rarely warranted.
Phototherapeutic Keratectomy using a 193- nm excimer laser is the method of choice nowadays, replacing manual lamellar keratoplasty as the former treatment of choice. PTK can be repeated several times for the treatment of recurrent corneal erosions, thus postponing corneal transplantation (lamellar or even penetrating) for a long time. This treatment achieves the removal of superficial corneal opacities, smoothing of the corneal surface, as well as correcting irregular astigmatism, and finally promotes the adherence of the epithelium to the underlying layers.
Lamellar and Penetrating Keratoplasty are seldom indicated for the treatment of MECD.
Rarely, a more severe phenotype with corneal erosions and significant scarring accompanied by a marked decrease in visual acuity may require treatment by keratoplasty or corneal grafting. Although epithelium damage is likely to recur in grafts, the recurrent disease is often less severe. It is important to postpone grafting as long as possible because most patients require regrafting due to recurrences. 
Surgical follow up
Surgical procedures that aim to remove the abnormal corneal epithelium are not curative, as the dystrophy recurs in the regenerated epithelium, and therefore provide only temporary symptomatic relief. All surgical treatment options have a high risk of recurrence.
Investigative Therapies
Limbal stem cell allo-transplantation may be an alternative to replace the affected epithelial stem cells, while inhibition of the abnormal gene using specific siRNA’s to silence the mutant allele has been evaluated in vitro and is a promising potential treatment strategy.
Prevention tips
Prognosis
Prognosis
The prognosis for these patients remains mostly favorable. In rare cases, vision can be permanently affected as a result of secondary scarring with vesicular rupture.
Possible complications
When to see a doctor / red flag
Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)
Differential diagnosis
Suspected cases of MECD need to be differentiated from other disorders of the corneal epithelium, such as:
Vapor spray keratitis
Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy or Cogan's microcystic corneal dystrophy
Reis-Bücklers corneal dystrophy.
Lisch epithelial corneal dystrophy (LECD)
MECD and LECD appear to present clinical similarities, and the two disease entities need to be distinguished from each other. This can be achieved by studying the different patterns of inheritance, i.e. X-linked recessive versus autosomal dominant.
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
Epidemiology
The prevalence of MECD is unknown, as an official registry of affected cases does not exist. It was first described in a large, multi-generational German family with more than 100 affected members and since then, the condition has been reported in individuals and families worldwide. Numerous cases have been identified in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Switzerland, the USA, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and Poland

Myopia (Nearsightedness)
MYDRIASIS
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
If your pupils are dilated, the black center of your eyes (pupils) are larger than usual. Pupils are typically the same size in both eyes.
Pupils change in size to control how much light enters your eye. The colorful part of your eye (iris) controls the size of your pupil with tiny muscles. In bright light, your pupils will get smaller to prevent light from entering. In the dark, pupils get larger to allow more light in. These changes are called direct responses.
Pupils also shrink when you focused on a close object. This is called an accommodative response. If a pupil does not get smaller in bright light or expand in the dark, the pupil is not functioning normally.
mydriasis
Mydriasis is when the pupil is dilated and doesn’t respond to light. Another term for mydriasis is “fixed pupil.”
What is a normal size for pupils?
A pupil’s normal size is 2 to 4 millimeters in bright light and 4 to 8 millimeters in dim light (dilated).
What do dilated pupils look like?
Pupils are dilated when the center black portion of your eyes takes up more space than the colorful portion of your eyes (iris).
Should I be worried about my dilated pupils?
Pupils are supposed to dilate under normal circumstances due to light changes and emotional variables. Most of the time, dilated pupils will go back to normal size on their own. If pupils dilate suddenly, occur after a traumatic injury or cause headaches and confusion, seek medical attention immediately.
Can one pupil be more dilated than the other?
Yes, when one pupil is more dilated than the other it is called anisocoria. This common condition occurs when both pupils react normally to light but vary in size by more than half a millimeter. Anisocoria affects about 20% of the population.
Causes 
What are the most common causes of dilated pupils?
The most common causes of dilated pupils are:
·        An eye exam (eye drops used to examine nerves and retina).
·        A reaction to medication.
·        A brain injury.
·        The use of recreational drugs.
·        Sexual arousal (increased production of oxytocin hormone).
·        Adrenaline.
What recreational drugs cause dilated pupils?
Certain recreational drugs can dilate pupils, including:
·        Cocaine.
·        Ecstasy (MDMA).
·        LSD.
·        Methamphetamines.
·        Psychedelic mushrooms.
What medications cause my pupils to dilate?
Certain over-the-counter and prescription medications can also lead to dilated pupils, including:
·        Antidepressants.
·        Antihistamines.
·        Anti-nausea medications.
·        Anti-seizure medications.
·        Atropine.
·        Botulinum toxin.
·        Medications for Parkinson’s disease.
What conditions cause dilated pupils?
Some medical conditions or injuries also dilate pupils, including:
·        Adie's pupil (abnormal pupil response to light in one eye).
·        Anisocoria (both pupils are different sizes).
·        Eye injury.
·        Head trauma.
·        Microvascular cranial nerve palsy (blood flow to nerves is blocked).
·        Migraine.
·        Ocular migraine (one eye can experience a sudden array of changes, similar to migraine sufferers without the headache.)
and risk factors
Signs and symptoms
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Diagnosing mydriasis involves a comprehensive assessment by a qualified doctor. The diagnostic process typically includes:
·        Physical Examination: A thorough physical exam is conducted to assess pupil size and reactivity to light. The doctor will check for any visible signs of eye injury or abnormalities.
·        Medical History: The doctor will review your medical history to identify potential causes of mydriasis, such as medication side effects, recent eye surgeries, or head injuries.
·        Visual Acuity Test: A visual acuity test is performed to evaluate the quality of your vision and check for any impairments related to the dilated pupils.
·        Ocular Motility Test: This test examines the muscles of the eye to assess their function and rule out any underlying neurological conditions that may be causing the mydriasis.
·        Blood Tests: In some cases, blood tests may be ordered to rule out systemic conditions that can manifest with mydriasis as a symptom.
Based on the findings from these diagnostic procedures, the doctor can determine the underlying cause of the mydriasis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Treatment & Management
The treatment for mydriasis depends on its underlying cause, with a focus on preserving eye function. If pupil dilation results from medication, doctors may recommend waiting for the drug’s effects to wear off instead of using additional medications to reverse it. However, in cases of brain or eye injuries, more aggressive treatments may be necessary. Severe trauma affecting the nerves or eye structures might require surgery to restore normal function. Some individuals may need to wear an eye patch during recovery to protect the affected eye. If mydriasis persists or worsens, medical intervention is crucial to prevent long-term complications. Here are some common treatment strategies:
·        Avoiding Direct Sunlight: If mydriasis causes light sensitivity, it is important to avoid direct sunlight exposure and wear protective sunglasses when outdoors.
·        Medications: In cases where mydriasis is caused by an allergic reaction to mydriatic agents, topical and systemic steroids or antiallergic medications may be prescribed to manage the symptoms.
·        Protective Eyewear: Wearing opaque contact lenses or light-sensitive sunglasses can help alleviate discomfort and manage light sensitivity associated with mydriasis.
·        Prosthetic Contact Lenses: In some cases, prosthetic contact lenses may be recommended to help reduce the amount of light entering the eye and improve comfort.
·        Surgery: In rare instances where mydriasis is caused by an underlying condition that requires surgical intervention, such as a brain tumour or aneurysm, surgery may be necessary as part of the treatment plan.
It is important to follow the doctor's recommendations closely and attend follow-up appointments to monitor the progress of treatment.
Medication for Mydriasis
Mydriasis is typically managed using topical medications that dilate the pupil. The commonly used medicines for mydriasis treatment include tropicamide, phenylephrine, cyclopentolate, and atropine. Tropicamide is used to produce mydriasis and cycloplegia for diagnostic procedures. It is an anticholinergic agent that relaxes the iris sphincter muscle to dilate the pupil. Phenylephrine is an adrenergic stimulant that acts on the iris dilator muscle. Cyclopentolate and atropine are also muscarinic antagonists, commonly used as mydriatics in various combinations. These medications can be administered in various formulations, including solutions, drops, and ophthalmic inserts. If you experience persistent or severe symptoms related to mydriasis, it is essential to consult a doctor for proper management.
Do dilated pupils hurt?
Often, dilated pupils will cause symptoms based on how light reaches the eye. These include:
·        Blurry vision.
·        Headaches.
·        Light sensitivity.
How are dilated pupils treated?
Most of the time, dilated pupils will return to normal on their own without treatment, especially if they are the result of eye drops. For more serious cases of mydriasis, further treatment is required, including:
·        Wearing sunglasses to reduce sunlight sensitivity (photochromic lenses, polarized lenses).
·        Prosthetic contact lenses (to improve the appearance of eyes as the result of varying pupil size caused by trauma).
·        Surgery (to repair eye damage from injury).
·        Substance abuse rehabilitation.
How long will my pupils be dilated?
If you received dilating eye drops from an ophthalmologist, your eyes could be dilated between four and 24 hours. The length of time is dependent on the type of drop used and how your body responds to it.
If pupil dilation is the side effect of a medication or drug, the duration may vary based on the type of drug and the dosage taken.
Pupil dilation that's a reaction to an emotional factor (adrenaline, attraction, stress) could have a shorter duration, and the pupil could return to normal size in as little as two to three minutes.

Prevention of Mydriasis
Preventing mydriasis involves taking steps to avoid exposure to agents that can cause the condition. Here are some key preventive measures:
·        Practicing Proper Hand Hygiene: Healthcare workers should follow strict hand hygiene protocols to minimize the risk of accidental exposure to anticholinergic agents that can cause mydriasis.
·        Avoiding Environmental Toxins: Steer clear of contact with environmental toxins like Jimson weed (Datura stramonium) or belladonna alkaloids found in certain plants, as these can trigger pupil dilation.
·        Protective Eyewear: If you're exposed to bright lights or certain chemicals, wearing sunglasses (particularly those with photochromic or polarised lenses) can help reduce light sensitivity.
·        Avoiding Certain Medications: Use medications, such as antihistamines, muscle relaxants, and medicines used to treat glaucoma, as directed by a doctor if dilated pupils are observed.
·        Avoid Recreational Drugs: Recreational drugs or excessive use of substances can lead to mydriasis. Avoiding these substances can help prevent pupil dilation.
By being aware of these potential triggers and taking appropriate precautions, the risk of developing mydriasis can be significantly reduced.
Prognosis
Complications
In many cases, mydriasis, especially when triggered by certain medications or plant exposure, resolves on its own within a few hours or days.
During this time, individuals may experience increased sensitivity to light. To reduce discomfort, wearing sunglasses outdoors and avoiding bright lights is recommended. It is also advisable to limit driving until vision returns to normal.
If mydriasis occurs as a reaction to medication, the individual should avoid taking that drug in the future and consult their doctor about alternative options. Similarly, those affected by plant-related allergies, such as exposure to angel’s trumpet, should take precautions to prevent future contact.
Because dilated pupils are often associated with recreational drug use, individuals with mydriasis may face uncomfortable or misleading assumptions about their condition.
Mydriasis can lead to several complications, depending on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. Some of the potential complications include:
·        Blindness: In severe cases, particularly those caused by brain injuries or neurological disorders, mydriasis can lead to vision loss or blindness.
·        Eye Irritation: Dilated pupils can cause increased sensitivity to light, leading to eye irritation and discomfort.
·        Headaches: Mydriasis can be accompanied by headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms due to increased light sensitivity.
·        Adie Syndrome: This rare neurological disorder is characterised by a dilated pupil that does not respond to light, along with the absence of deep tendon reflexes. Adie syndrome can cause vision problems, eye pain, and sensitivity to light.
Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of mydriasis can help prevent or manage these complications, ensuring better eye health and overall well-being.
When to see a doctor / red flag
When To Call the Doctor
When should I contact my healthcare provider?
Although it is normal for dilation to occur based on changes in light, mydriasis could be a sign of an eye injury or problem within the brain, like a head injury, tumor or stroke. Contact your healthcare provider if you experience any of the following:
·        Dizziness, headache or confusion (signs of a stroke).
·        Sudden pupil dilation that isn’t caused by light change.
·        Pupils don’t change when light changes.
·        One pupil is larger than the other.
·        Dilation persists for long periods of time.
Additional Common Questions
Do your pupils dilate when you love someone?
Pupil dilation can be attributed to an increase in the hormone and neurotransmitter oxytocin, which acts as a chemical messenger during sexual arousal. Oxytocin also plays a role in controlling key aspects of the reproductive system, including sperm transportation and production, childbirth and breastfeeding.
Does anxiety cause dilated pupils?
In some cases, anxiety can cause pupils to dilate as a result of adrenaline. The hormones and chemicals released from the adrenal glands send nerve impulses to organs, leading the body to react in a “fight or flight” mode. Stress can stimulate adrenaline hormones to react, resulting in dilated pupils, increased heart rate, high blood pressure and excessive sweating.
Do your pupils dilate when you lie?
Similar to how your body reacts in a “fight or flight” adrenaline situation, lying can cause hormones and chemicals associated with stress to trigger eye dilation.

Nystagmus
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
What is nystagmus?
Nystagmus (pronounced “ni-STAG-muhs”) is a condition where your eyes make rapid, repetitive, uncontrolled movements. Your eyes may move in different directions:
Side to side (horizontal nystagmus).
Up and down (vertical nystagmus).
In a circle (rotary or torsional nystagmus).
The movements can follow different patterns. Your eyes may:
Drift in one direction and then jerk in the opposite direction to correct (jerk nystagmus).
Drift back and forth in a steady, pendulum-like motion (pendular nystagmus).
These eye movements can cause problems with vision, depth perception, balance and coordination.
Types of nystagmus
Nystagmus affects both children and adults. There are two types: congenital or infantile (onset at birth or in the first few months of life) and acquired (onset after 6 months of age).
Congenital or infantile nystagmus
Babies born with nystagmus usually show symptoms between 6 weeks and 3 months of age. Sometimes, parents pass nystagmus on to their children, but the exact cause isn’t always clear. Children with congenital nystagmus often have it in both eyes. Their eyes usually move side to side. The main symptom is blurry vision.
Acquired nystagmus
Acquired nystagmus develops later in life and is more common in adults. Nystagmus may be a symptom of a medical condition affecting your brain, eyes or ears. Or, it may not be related to a condition at all. It may just be how your body works. Sometimes nystagmus results from alcohol and drug use. Adults with acquired nystagmus often describe their vision as shaky.
Spasmus nutans is a form of acquired nystagmus that affects children. It’s usually diagnosed between 6 months and 3 years old. This type of nystagmus usually improves without treatment between ages 2 and 8.
How common is nystagmus?
Researchers don’t know for sure how many people in the general population have nystagmus. Previous studies have reported that anywhere from 6 to 24 people out of every 10,000 have some type of nystagmus.
Is nystagmus a serious condition?
Nystagmus itself isn’t considered dangerous. But it may be associated with serious health conditions, especially those affecting your brain, such as stroke, brain tumor, toxicity, head trauma (injury) and inflammatory diseases.
Causes and risk factors
What causes nystagmus?
Your brain controls eye movement in conjunction with the structures in your ear, called the vestibular system. It automatically adjusts your eyes when you move your head so that the image you see remains in focus. In people with nystagmus, a problem prevents your brain, the vestibular system and your eyes from working together.
Nystagmus could indicate another eye problem, a neurological condition or a problem with the parts of your inner ear that control balance and coordination.
Nystagmus causes and risk factors include:
Developmental problems with your brain or eye.
Retina or optic nerve disorders.
Inner ear disorders, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Ménière’s disease.
Stroke.
Brain tumor.
Eye or head trauma (injury).
Alcohol or drug use.
Albinism (lack of pigmentation in the skin).
Vision problems, including nearsightedness or astigmatism.
Certain medications, such as antiseizure drugs.
Diseases affecting your central nervous system, like multiple sclerosis (MS).
Eye problems in babies, including strabismus (crossed eyes), focusing issues and cataracts.
Sometimes, there isn’t a clear cause. This is called idiopathic nystagmus.
Signs and symptoms
What are the symptoms of nystagmus?
The biggest sign of nystagmus is uncontrollable movement in your eyes. The symptoms of nystagmus depend on the condition causing it and include:
Feeling as if your surroundings are moving (oscillopsia).
Shaky or blurry vision.
Balance problems.
Light sensitivity or trouble seeing in the dark.
Dizziness or feeling like you’re spinning (vertigo).
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Diagnosis and Tests
How is nystagmus diagnosed?
An eye care specialist called an ophthalmologist typically diagnoses nystagmus. They’ll perform an eye exam and ask about your symptoms. They’ll check for eye problems related to nystagmus, including strabismus, cataracts or issues with your retina or optic nerve. Other specialists, such as brain doctors (neurologists) and ear doctors (otorhinolaryngologists), can also diagnose nystagmus and test you for brain or inner ear conditions causing it.
Tests to diagnose nystagmus
You may need additional tests with different providers to learn what’s causing nystagmus. An ophthalmologist may perform tests to see if an eye disease is causing nystagmus. A neurologist may perform tests to see if a brain condition is causing nystagmus. An otorhinolaryngologist or audiologist may test to see if nystagmus relates to an inner ear condition.
Tests may include:
A neurological exam.
An ear exam.
Eye movement recordings (such as electronystagmography and video-nystagmography).
Imaging tests to capture pictures of your brain, such as CT scan (computed tomography scan) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).
Genetic tests to identify inherited genetic mutations (errors in your DNA) associated with some forms of congenital nystagmus.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
Can nystagmus be corrected?
The correction of nystagmus depends on the medical condition responsible for it.
Sometimes, treating the underlying condition can correct acquired nystagmus. For example, treating an inner ear condition causing nystagmus can improve symptoms like shaky vision or dizziness. In some conditions, your brain and vestibular system compensate for the damage, and nystagmus goes away or decreases over time.
Certain types of congenital nystagmus may disappear later in life. Other types can’t be cured completely, but proper treatment can manage symptoms.
What are the treatments for nystagmus?
Your healthcare provider will recommend treatment based on what’s causing your nystagmus. They’ll also consider your health history and personal preferences.
Glasses or contact lenses
Clearer vision can help slow the rapid eye movements associated with nystagmus. Your provider may recommend eyeglasses or contact lenses to manage symptoms. You may need prism lenses, which limit how much your eyes must move to see clearly.
Medications
Some medications can reduce nystagmus symptoms in adults, such as gabapentin (antiseizure), baclofen (muscle relaxant) and onabotulinumtoxina (Botox®). Your healthcare provider will determine whether you would benefit from any medications.
Eye muscle surgery
In rare instances, your provider may recommend strabismus surgery. During this procedure, a surgeon repositions the muscles that move the eyes. This surgery doesn’t cure nystagmus, but it improves your eye movement. You won’t have to tilt or turn your head as much to see clearly.
Vision correction surgery
If you have nystagmus and are nearsighted, you may benefit from laser vision correction surgery — such as LASIK. Laser eye surgery doesn’t cure nystagmus, but it improves your vision. Improved vision can reduce your nystagmus symptoms.
Prevention tips
Prevention
How can I prevent nystagmus?
Currently, there’s no way to prevent nystagmus. But you can reduce symptoms by treating the underlying cause.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have nystagmus?
Nystagmus can make everyday tasks more challenging. Sometimes, it limits the types of jobs and hobbies you can have.
Nystagmus rarely goes away completely, but it can improve over time. Your healthcare provider can help you find a treatment that works for you.

When should I see my healthcare provider?
Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you notice any changes in your vision or have difficulties with balance or coordination. Remember that nystagmus can be a symptom of serious health issues. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential.
If you’ve already been diagnosed with nystagmus, inform your provider if your symptoms worsen.

Age
All types of the acquired nystagmus described earlier, except spasmus nutans, can occur at any age. Onset of spasmus nutans is in infants aged 4-14 months with disappearance by age 5 years. Subclinical nystagmus, following the resolution of spasmus nutans, persists until at least 5 to 12 years of age. [37]
Infantile nystagmus (juvenile nystagmus) is classified as onset before age 6 months and is discussed in a separate article.

OCULAR TUMORS (EYE CANCER)
These include benign and malignant growths affecting various eye structures.
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Ocular tumors are also known as “eye neoplasm”, and sometimes referred to as “Eye tumors”, or “eye neoplasm”.
Definition and description
An eye tumor can be cancerous or noncancerous. About 3,490 new eye cancers are estimated to be diagnosed in 2023. Symptoms of eye tumors can include vision changes, pain, and changes in the shape and movement of the eye.
Eye cancer includes several rare types of cancers that begin in your eye, including your eyeball and the structures surrounding your eyeball. Eye cancer starts when cells multiply out of control and form a tumor. Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Unlike benign tumors, malignant tumors can grow and the cancer can spread throughout your body. 
Diagnosing and treating eye cancers early can often prevent the spread. 
What are the types of eye cancer? 
Healthcare providers categorize eye cancers based on where cancer starts, its location in your eye and the types of cells. 
Intraocular melanomas 
Intraocular melanoma arises from cells called melanocytes, the same type of cell involved in the most serious form of skin cancer (melanoma). Most eye cancers are melanomas. Most form in the middle part of your eye (uvea). They’re called uveal melanomas. They include: 
Iris melanoma: Forms in the colored part of your eye, or iris. It often produces a dark, growing spot that stands out against your iris. They tend to grow slowly. 
Ciliary body melanoma: Forms in the muscles that adjust your eyeball lens so you can see objects near and far. The ciliary body is behind your iris. 
Choroidal melanoma: Forms in the layer of your eyeball that keeps your retina (in the back of your eye) and the front of your eye nourished with blood. The choroid is the most common site for eye melanoma to form. 
Melanomas sometimes form in the conjunctiva, the membrane that covers the front part of your eyeball. They’re called conjunctival melanomas. They’re incredibly rare. Like uveal melanomas, they tend to spread and are aggressive. 
Eyelid and orbital cancer 
Orbital and adnexal cancer form in the tissues close to your eyeball. Orbital cancers form in your orbit, or the tissues, muscles and nerves that move your eyeball. Adnexal cancer forms in supporting tissues, including your eyelids and tear glands. Healthcare providers classify them according to the type of cell that transforms into cancer. 
Most are: 
Squamous cell carcinoma: Forms from the squamous cells in your top layer of skin. 
Basal cell carcinoma: Forms from the basal cells in your top layer of skin. 
Rhabdomyosarcoma: Forms inside muscle tissue. 
Retinoblastoma 
Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor arising from the retina in the back of your eye. They’re most common in children under age five. 
Intraocular lymphoma 
Intraocular lymphoma is a rare form of B-cell lymphoma. It forms in white blood cells called lymphocytes. It’s most common in people who are older than 50 or who have weakened immune systems. Many people with this form of eye cancer also have primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a cancer that may affect various parts of your central nervous system, including your brain, spinal cord and spinal fluid. 
How common is eye cancer? 
Eye cancer is extremely rare. Only about 3,400 people in the United States receive an eye cancer diagnosis each year. It’s more common for cancers to start in other parts of your body and spread to your eye. Because they don’t start in your eye, providers don’t consider these cancers eye cancer. 
What is the most common form of eye cancer? 
Intraocular melanomas are by far the most common form of eye cancer. Most start in the middle part of your eye in a structure called the choroid. Approximately 2,500 people in the United States receive this diagnosis each year. 
Causes
causes of eye cancer
As with cancers in general, eye cancer occurs when cells begin to divide and multiply out of control, eventually forming a mass called a tumor. Pieces of the tumor can break off and spread to your lymph nodes and bloodstream. The cancer cells can travel to other parts of your body via your bloodstream and lymphatic system, causing new tumors to form in other organs. When this happens, healthcare providers say that your cancer has “spread” or “metastasized.” It’s a sign of a more advanced disease. 
Scientists are still researching to understand what causes otherwise healthy cells to become cancer cells. 
risk factors for eye cancer
Researchers have identified several risk factors that may increase your likelihood of developing eye cancer: 
Age: Providers diagnose most eye cancers in people over 50. The exception is retinoblastoma, which affects children under age 5. 
Skin color: You’re more likely to get eye cancer if you’re white and if you have pale skin. 
Eye color: People with light eyes (blue, green) are more likely to get eye cancer than people with dark eyes (brown). 
Inherited conditions: Dysplastic nevus syndrome, an inherited condition that involves having several atypical-looking moles, can increase your risk of some eye cancers. BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome can increase your risk of multiple cancers, including uveal melanoma. 
Sunning and tanning: It’s possible that exposure to UV rays from the sun or tanning beds can increase your risk of intraocular melanoma. Medical researchers need to conduct more research to know for sure. 
Signs and symptoms
Many people with eye cancer don’t experience symptoms unless a tumor is growing in a location that interferes with how their eye works. Experiencing symptoms doesn’t mean you have eye cancer. Many benign (noncancerous) eye conditions share symptoms with eye cancer. See a healthcare provider to know for sure. 
The most common symptom of eye cancer is painless vision loss. Other vision problems that may be signs of eye cancer include: 
Blurry vision. 
Vision loss (either partial or total). 
Seeing flashes of light, squiggly lines or spots (floaters). 
Other signs and symptoms include: 
A bulging eye. 
Eye irritation that doesn’t improve. 
A dark spot in your iris that gets bigger. 
A growing lump on your eyelid or in your eyeball. 
Changes in your eyeball’s positioning in the socket and how it moves. 
What are the first signs of eye cancer? 
Most people don’t learn they have eye cancer until a healthcare provider, like an optometrist or ophthalmologist, notices something suspicious during an eye exam. For example, enlarged blood vessels in your eye or a dark spot may signal eye cancer or another eye condition. You’ll need tests to be sure. 
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Diagnosis and Tests 
An eye disease specialist (ophthalmologist) or an ocular oncologist diagnoses eye cancer. They may perform a variety of procedures to rule out other, more common eye conditions before arriving at a cancer diagnosis. 
Eye exam
During an eye exam, a healthcare provider examines your eye closely, looking for signs of cancer. They may look for dark spots and enlarged blood vessels. They may check to see if your eyeball is moving as it should. They may use special tools to see the structures in your eye more clearly. 
Ophthalmoscope: An ophthalmoscope is a handheld instrument that contains a light and multiple lenses. It allows healthcare providers to view structures in the back of your eyeball, like your retina. 
Slit lamp: A slit lamp is a device that sits on a platform and table. It uses a light source and special lenses, like a microscope, to see detailed views of the front and back of your eyeball. 
Imaging 
The results of imaging procedures and the information from your eye exam are often enough to diagnose eye cancer. Common imaging procedures include: 
Ultrasound: Ultrasounds use sound waves to create images of the inside of your eyeball. Ultrasounds show how big a tumor is and its location. They’re especially useful in diagnosing intraocular melanomas. 
Fluorescein angiography: During this procedure, a healthcare provider injects dye into your bloodstream that makes your blood vessels show up more clearly during imaging. Once the dye has had time to reach the blood vessels in your eyeball, your provider uses a special camera that shows how blood is flowing in your eyeball. 
You may need additional imaging procedures if your provider suspects the cancer’s spread. Imaging procedures that can show if cancer’s spread to parts outside your eye include: 
Ultrasound. 
Chest X-ray. 
CT scan. 
MRI. 
PET scan. 
Biopsy 
During a biopsy, a healthcare provider removes a sample of tissue from the tumor and tests it for cancer cells. Healthcare providers can identify most eye cancers with a physical exam and imaging. Still, a biopsy can provide information about the makeup of your cancer cells, including genetic mutations (changes) that make them unique. Your provider can use this information to determine characteristics about your cancer, like how aggressive it is. It can also show if you’re eligible for certain treatments. 
Fine needle aspiration biopsy: A tiny needle removes a sample of fluid from your eye to test for cancer cells. 
Incisional biopsy: A provider removes part of the tumor and tests the tissue for cancer cells. 
Excisional biopsy: A provider removes the entire tumor and tests the tissue for cancer cells. 
How is eye cancer staged? 
Cancer staging helps providers determine how advanced cancer is. They use this information to plan treatments and gauge your prognosis, or the likely outcome of your condition. 
There are two common staging systems for eye cancer: 
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system 
Providers stage cancer by assessing various factors. 
T: The tumor’s size and whether it’s grown into nearby parts of your eye. 
N: Whether the tumor’s spread to the lymph nodes in your ear and neck. 
M: Whether the cancer’s spread to other organs (usually your liver). 
They consider this information together to assign eye cancer a stage between I and IV, with I being the least advanced and IV meaning the cancer’s more advanced. 
Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) staging system 
Another common system stages cancer based on tumor size. Size influences the type of treatments that will likely work best. Measurements are in millimeters (mm). 
Small: Between 1 mm and 2.5 mm in height and 5 mm to 16 mm in width. 
Medium: Between 2.5 mm and 10 mm in height and 16 mm or less in width. 
Large: Bigger than 10 millimeters in height and 16 millimeters in width. 
What additional tests will be done to diagnose eye cancer? 
Your provider may recommend liver imaging scans if they suspect your cancer’s spread. Your liver is the most common place for eye cancer to spread outside of your eye. 
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment 
For slow-growing tumors or if the diagnosis isn’t certain, your provider may recommend monitoring your condition and delaying treatment — especially if treatment risks outweigh the benefits. For example, you may want to delay treatment if treating an area could cause vision loss. 
Radiation therapy 
Radiation therapy is one of the most common treatments for eye cancer. 
Brachytherapy: Brachytherapy, or internal radiation therapy, is the most common treatment for eye melanomas. For treatment, your provider will implant a tiny disc near the tumor that releases radiation to kill cancer cells. 
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT): With EBRT, a machine that never touches your body directs radiation toward a tumor. Techniques include stereotactic surgery, which directs high doses of radiation toward your tumor in one treatment session. Proton beam radiation therapy is another option. This is a newer form of radiation therapy that delivers precise, high doses of radiation toward tumors. As the equipment is very expensive to maintain, it isn’t available everywhere. 
Surgery 
Surgery is a common treatment option, especially for small tumors that haven’t spread beyond your eyeball. Procedures include: 
Iridectomy: Removes part of your iris. Providers commonly use this procedure when treating small melanomas. 
Iridocyclectomy: Removes part of your iris and ciliary body. Providers commonly use this procedure when treating small melanomas. 
Transscleral resection: Removes melanomas in your choroid or ciliary body. 
Enucleation: Removes your eyeball. You may need this surgery for large tumors or when there’s no way to preserve your vision with treatment. Afterward, you’ll get an artificial eyeball that matches your remaining eye. Your healthcare team will work with you closely to fit you with a replacement that looks and moves like your eye. 
Orbital exenteration: Removes your entire eyeball and some of the surrounding tissue. Your provider may recommend this procedure if the cancer’s spread into structures surrounding your eyeball. As with enucleation, you’ll get an artificial eyeball implant afterward. 
Laser therapy 
Laser therapy uses heat to destroy eye cancer. The most common type is transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT). During the procedure, infrared light delivers concentrated heat toward the tumor, destroying cancer cells. Providers may use this on its own or after brachytherapy to prevent cancer from returning (recurring). 
Immunotherapy 
Immunotherapy treatments help your immune system identify and destroy cancer cells more effectively. In certain instances, providers use the immunotherapy drug tebentafusp to treat uveal melanoma. Immunotherapy is a common treatment for cancer that’s spread or that providers can’t surgically remove. 
Targeted therapy 
Targeted therapy drugs target specific weaknesses in cancer cells, destroying them. You may be eligible for targeted therapy treatments if cancer cells contain a BRAF gene mutation (change). Currently, this mutation is more common in skin melanomas, but this treatment may be beneficial in people with eye melanomas, too. 
Chemotherapy 
Chemotherapy isn’t a common treatment for eye cancer, but your healthcare provider may recommend it if your cancer hasn’t responded to other treatments or if it spreads to other areas. 
What are possible treatment side effects? 
Side effects depend on the type of treatment your provider recommends. As these treatments target your eye, it’s possible that you’ll experience vision changes. One of the most significant risks is partial or complete vision loss. These risks depend on multiple factors that you should discuss with your provider. 
Prevention tips
Prevention 
There’s no way to prevent eye cancer. Still, you can improve your prognosis by getting screened if you know that you’re in a high-risk group for getting eye cancer. For example, you may consider regular exams if you have BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome. If you have a family history of retinoblastoma and have a child, it’s a good idea to get them regular eye exams to screen for cancer. 
Prognosis
Outlook / Prognosis 
Your prognosis, or likely treatment outcome, depends on many factors, including the tumor’s size, location and how much it’s spread. For example, brachytherapy eliminates 95% of small and medium intraocular melanomas. Eye cancer may not be curable. However, its growth within your eyeball can be contained. 
Ask your healthcare provider about your prognosis based on your specific type of eye cancer. 
What is the survival rate of eye cancer? 
Survival rates communicate information about how many people with a certain cancer diagnosis are alive five years after their diagnosis when compared to people without the same diagnosis. The survival rates for the most common form of eye cancer, intraocular melanoma, are excellent when a provider diagnoses and treats the cancer when it’s still in your eyeball. The survival rates aren’t as good if the cancer’s spread to other organs. 
Fortunately, providers diagnose and treat most cancers before they’ve metastasized.

Epidemiology of ocular surface and orbital tumors 
The clinical diagnosis of ocular surface tumors can be challenging due to their similar signs and symptoms. Therefore, collecting more cases and differentiating between pathological types and epidemiological changes is crucial to enhance the identification of these tumors. Benign tumors are frequently found in the eyelid area, with the conjunctiva, orbit, cornea, and limbus following suit in occurrence.  
We aimed to elucidate the reason behind the limited diversity observed in the occurrence of eye tumor sites. The high incidence of eyelid tumors could be attributed to the intricate nature of the eyelid’s placement in the outermost layer of the eye’s structure and its constant exposure to the external environment, which may facilitate the growth of tumors. 
Previous research has indicated that ocular tumors in children are linked to genetic factors and an abnormality in embryonic growth processes. Eyelid and ocular surface tumors are the most common types of ocular tumors in epidemiological studies. Most eyelid and ocular surface tumors are benign; a few are malignant. Intraocular and orbital tumors are mainly malignant. Calcified epithelioma is a common benign tumor in children’s eyelids. The cortical differentiation of the epidermis forms it and is a benign tumor in the deep skin. The most common malignant tumors on their eyelids and ocular surfaces in individuals aged 65 and above are squamous, basal, and melanoma. These tumors are frequently found in the eyelid and orbit. 
Cavernous hemangioma is the most frequently occurring orbital site, typically affecting young individuals and presenting with slow proptosis as the main symptom. The histopathological imaging features of cavernous angioma involve irregular expansion of vascular spaces, partial capillary hyperplasia, and infiltration of interstitial plasma cells. Adult orbital malignancies primarily comprise lymphoma, a proliferative disease of immune cell tumors with multiple pathological types. Most cases are diagnosed as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, considered low-grade malignant lymphomas. Clinical symptoms and imaging studies can be challenging to differentiate from other conditions, such as specific inflammation, leading to misdiagnosis. Accurate diagnosis requires pathological examination and immunohistochemistry. 
Tumors in the eyelids are among the most common ocular tumors, often caused by external contact or stimulation. Unfortunately, many of these tumors can be difficult to distinguish from inflammatory lesions, and malignant tumors can even metastasize and damage ocular health. Recent studies have shown that the number of patients with eyelid tumors is increasing each year, particularly for benign tumors like seborrheic keratosis and xanthoma. This could be due to changes in people’s lifestyles, cultures, and material consumption levels, as well as an increase in metabolic disorders among the population. For example, xanthoma, a systemic disease that often manifests as skin lesions, frequently appears on the eyelids. In malignant tumors, distinguishing between melanocytes can be challenging, and most proliferative lesions may develop into malignant melanoma if specific conditions are met. Basal epithelial cells may also have the ability to produce melanin, which can lead to malignancy. BCC is a common ocular surface malignancy occurring almost on the eyelids. Usually, nodules with pearl margins, central ulceration, and telangiectasia vessels. Risk factors include old age, sun exposure, and immunosuppression, with high recurrence rates. Moreover, sebaceous carcinoma (SCC) often affects older people, usually from the eyelid glands, with early symptoms of mild and insidious development. 
Studies have shown that ocular surface microbes, temperature, and ultraviolet (UV) light can impact the conjunctival microenvironment. These Studies have shown that ocular surface microbes, temperature, and UV light can impact the conjunctival microenvironment. C.L. Shields et al. investigated 5002 patients and found that identifying benign and malignant conjunctival tumors had valuable clinical features. However, experience based on clinical work still requires a histopathological diagnosis. Goblet cells and lymphatic vessels are widespread in the conjunctiva, and irritation or blockage creates cysts. Conjunctival cysts are divided into dermoid and epidermoid, which can occur after surgery due to the invagination of conjunctival epithelial cells, and both capsule walls can be coated with laminated squamous epithelium. Unlike congenital cysts, goblet cells are standard cells of the cystic wall, where, in a few cases, the wall is composed entirely of goblet cells, and the cavity is filled with jelly samples. Sebaceous adenocarcinoma is most found in elderly patients and those with conjunctival issues. Most cases occur in the area surrounding the eye, where the sebaceous glands are most abundant 
The cornea plays a crucial role in the path of light, and maintaining its structure and function is essential for normal vision and refraction. The development of corneal tumors can result in significant visual impairment or even blindness. Malignant tumors in the cornea are also at risk of metastasizing. Distinguishing between corneal neoplasia and hyperplastic tumor-like lesions poses a clinical challenge, with dermoid tumors being the most frequent benign tumors found in the cornea and limbus. 
The limbus is the boundary between the clear cornea and the white sclera, covering the conjunctiva. Research has shown that limbal stem cells can experience malignant degeneration like other tissues in the limbus; recurrent epithelial defects may be related to the limbal stem cell defect. Due to the limbal pathological changes’ unique anatomical structure and location, there are many misunderstood conditions, including Mooren ulcers and corneal dystrophy.

OPTIC ATROPHY
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Optic neuropathy
Definition and description
What is optic atrophy?
Optic atrophy is a condition that affects the cells of your optic nerve, which carries impulses from your eye to your brain. “Atrophy” means to waste away or deteriorate. Optic nerve atrophy is another name for optic atrophy, and it’s a serious condition.
Atrophy of the optic nerve is a condition that happens because of long-term damage to optic nerve fibers from many different causes. Optic atrophy can cause irreversible issues with vision, including blindness.
Causes
What causes optic atrophy?
Nerve fibers that transmit impulses to your brain make up your optic nerve. In the case of optic atrophy, something is interfering with your optic nerve’s ability to transmit these impulses. Many factors can cause this interference, including:
Lack of proper blood flow (vascular/ischemia): This is the most common cause of optic nerve atrophy.
Conditions that you’re born with or inherit (congenital): One condition, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, causes you to lose vision in one eye first and then the other.
Pressure from outside (extrinsic compression) and inside the nerve (intrinsic compression): The pressure can come from tumors. Glaucoma can damage your optic nerve and sometimes includes high eye pressure (intraocular pressure).
Damage from inflammation, either from other diseases or swelling in the optic nerve itself: One cause is optic neuritis, which is inflammation of your optic nerve. Another is hydrocephalus, or fluid collection in your brain.
Damage from infections: These infections can include diseases like syphilis and measles.
Trauma (eye injury): Eye injuries can happen in many ways, including industrial or car accidents, sports or fighting.
Damage from diseases of the retina: Retinal diseases include diabetes-related retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion.
Damage from toxins, nutritional deficits or medications:Optic nerve atrophy from these causes usually affects both eyes.
Is optic atrophy contagious?
You can’t catch optic atrophy from anyone, but many types of infections can cause the condition. These infections include:
Syphilis.
Measles.
Tuberculosis.
Mumps.
Chickenpox.
Lyme disease.
Aspergillosis.
Cryptococcosis.
 and risk factors
Signs and symptoms
What are the symptoms of optic atrophy?
Optic atrophy symptoms relate to changes in vision, including:
Blurred vision or a reduction in sharpness of vision.
Difficulties with peripheral vision.
Difficulties with color vision.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
How is optic atrophy diagnosed?
It’s important to see an eye care specialist if you have any vision issues. They’ll begin by asking questions about your symptoms and your medical history. They may ask about what you eat, drink and what drugs or medications you take, including supplements. Then, they’ll do an eye exam.
What tests will be done to diagnose optic atrophy?
During testing, your provider will use an ophthalmoscope to look at your eyes. With optic atrophy, there are cell changes that providers can see, along with a paleness to your optic disc. The lack of color is related to blood flow changes in optic atrophy.
Your provider, who may also be looking for things like multiple sclerosis or tumors, may rely on other tests like these:
Optical coherence tomography.
Visual field tests.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.
Fluorescein angiography.
Ultrasound.
Blood tests.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
How is optic atrophy treated?
There’s no real cure or treatment for optic atrophy. This is why it’s so important to have regular eye exams and to see your healthcare provider right away for vision changes.
Your provider will need to treat the cause of the optic atrophy to stop the condition from getting worse. For instance, they may need to remove a tumor or remove fluid from your brain and spinal cord.
Prevention tips
Prevention
Can optic atrophy be prevented?
In most cases, you can’t prevent optic atrophy. You may be able to decrease your risk in some cases. For instance, you can:
Wear safety goggles to prevent eye injuries.
Get necessary vaccines to prevent infections when possible.
Practice safe sex to avoid sexually transmitted infections.
Prognosis
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have optic atrophy?
The outlook for people with optic atrophy depends on what’s causing the issue. If the cause is optic neuritis, you can usually count on eventually getting your vision back when the inflammation goes away. If the cause is some other optic neuropathy, your vision might not improve.
If you have glaucoma, early diagnosis can lead to successful treatment and slower growth of optic atrophy. Early diagnosis of a tumor can lead to prompt treatment and better outcomes. This can relieve the pressure on your optic nerve and prevent further damage.
If your sight worsens, ask your provider about ways to cope with low vision. There are low-vision aids like special lenses and magnifying glasses. There are also non-optical materials, like text-reading software.
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider about optic atrophy?
You should see a provider for regular eye exams, especially if you have any type of eye-related conditions. You should consult a provider if you have any changes in your vision, like blurry vision, or difficulties with color vision or with peripheral vision.
If you have a sudden loss of vision or extreme eye pain, call your provider or get immediate medical help. These can be symptoms of serious eye conditions.
Possible complications
What are the complications of optic atrophy?
Optic atrophy can’t be reversed. The major complication is loss of vision, or blindness.

Promising Treatments and Future Outlook
In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the field of optic atrophy research, leading to the development of promising treatments that offer hope for individuals with this condition.
One of the most exciting areas of research is gene therapy. Scientists are exploring the use of gene therapy to target and repair the specific genetic mutations that cause optic atrophy. By delivering healthy copies of the affected genes into the cells of the optic nerve, it is hoped that vision loss can be halted or even reversed. While still in the early stages of development, gene therapy holds great promise for the future of optic atrophy treatment.
Another potential treatment avenue is stem cell therapy. Stem cells have the unique ability to differentiate into various cell types, including those found in the optic nerve. Researchers are investigating the use of stem cells to replace damaged or lost cells in the optic nerve, with the goal of restoring vision. Although this approach is still experimental, early studies have shown promising results.
Additionally, neuroprotective therapies are being explored to prevent further damage to the optic nerve. These therapies aim to protect the remaining healthy cells and promote their survival. Various drugs and compounds are being studied for their potential neuroprotective effects, including antioxidants, growth factors, and anti-inflammatory agents.
Furthermore, advances in prosthetic devices and visual aids are improving the quality of life for individuals with optic atrophy. Retinal implants, for example, can bypass the damaged cells in the retina and directly stimulate the remaining healthy cells, allowing for the perception of light and shapes. Other assistive technologies, such as magnifying glasses, screen readers, and voice-activated devices, are also helping individuals with visual impairments to navigate their daily lives.
While these treatments and technologies show great promise, it is important to note that they are still in the research and development phase. Clinical trials and further studies are needed to determine their safety, efficacy, and long-term effects. However, the progress being made in optic atrophy research provides hope for a brighter future for patients with this condition.
Optic Nerve Regeneration
Optic nerve regeneration is a field of research that holds great promise for restoring vision in individuals with optic atrophy. The optic nerve is responsible for transmitting visual information from the eye to the brain, and any damage to this nerve can result in vision loss. Traditional belief held that the optic nerve cannot regenerate once it is damaged, but recent advancements in regenerative medicine and innovative techniques have challenged this notion.
One approach being explored for optic nerve regeneration is the use of stem cells. Stem cells have the unique ability to differentiate into various cell types, including nerve cells. Researchers are investigating the potential of using stem cells to replace damaged or lost nerve cells in the optic nerve. This could potentially restore the transmission of visual signals and improve vision.
Another promising avenue for optic nerve regeneration is the use of gene therapy. Gene therapy involves introducing specific genes into cells to correct genetic abnormalities or promote the growth of new cells. Scientists are studying the possibility of using gene therapy to stimulate the regeneration of optic nerve cells and enhance their functionality.
In addition to stem cells and gene therapy, researchers are also exploring the role of neurotrophic factors in optic nerve regeneration. Neurotrophic factors are proteins that support the growth and survival of nerve cells. By delivering these factors directly to the damaged optic nerve, scientists aim to promote the regeneration of nerve fibers and improve visual outcomes.
While optic nerve regeneration is still in the early stages of research, these advancements offer hope for the development of effective treatments in the future. Continued studies and clinical trials are necessary to further understand the mechanisms involved in optic nerve regeneration and to determine the safety and efficacy of these approaches. With further progress, it is possible that optic nerve regeneration could become a viable treatment option for individuals with optic atrophy, ultimately restoring their vision and improving their quality of life.
Artificial Vision and Prosthetics
Artificial vision and prosthetics have emerged as promising solutions for individuals with optic atrophy. These innovative technologies aim to restore limited vision and improve the quality of life for those affected by this condition.
Visual prostheses, also known as bionic eyes, are designed to bypass damaged optic nerves and stimulate the remaining functional parts of the visual system. These devices consist of an external camera that captures visual information and converts it into electrical signals. These signals are then transmitted to an implanted electrode array, which stimulates the remaining healthy retinal cells or the visual cortex directly.
One of the most well-known visual prostheses is the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System. This device has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in individuals with severe to profound retinitis pigmentosa, a condition that can lead to optic atrophy. The Argus II system includes a small camera mounted on a pair of glasses, a portable video processing unit, and an implanted retinal prosthesis. It works by converting visual information into electrical signals that are transmitted wirelessly to the retinal prosthesis, which then stimulates the remaining retinal cells to create visual perceptions.
While visual prostheses have shown promising results in restoring limited vision, it is important to note that the quality and clarity of the restored vision may vary among individuals. The level of visual improvement depends on various factors, including the severity of optic atrophy and the overall health of the visual system.
In addition to visual prostheses, researchers are also exploring other innovative approaches to artificial vision, such as optogenetics. Optogenetics involves genetically modifying retinal cells to make them sensitive to light and then using light stimulation to activate these cells and generate visual signals. Although still in the experimental stage, optogenetics holds great potential for restoring vision in individuals with optic atrophy.
In conclusion, artificial vision and prosthetics offer hope for individuals with optic atrophy by providing the possibility of restored vision. Visual prostheses, such as the Argus II system, have already shown promising results in improving limited vision. Ongoing research and advancements in technologies like optogenetics hold the potential for further enhancing the effectiveness of these treatments. While these solutions may not fully restore normal vision, they can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals affected by optic atrophy.

Optic Atrophy: Causes, Symptoms & Treatment
epidemiology
The prevalence of optic atrophy varies widely. Optic atrophy was one of the five main causes of blindness in prevalence studies from Israel, Japan, Scotland, Zaire, and other countries.[5][6][7][8][9]. In the Oman eye study, 5% of the blindness was attributable to this condition.[10] In a study from Egypt, the age-adjusted blindness prevalence rates per 1000 persons showed that in an urban population, 4.1% of the blindness and in a rural population 1.2% of the blindness was attributable to optic atrophy.[11]
In southern Germany, newly registered blindness-allowance recipients were analyzed for the causes of blindness. Among the 3531 individuals, the standardized incidence rate per 100,000 person-years for optic atrophy was 2.86 (SD 2.66-3.05).[12] In a study from the Baltimore area of the United States, the prevalence of blindness due to optic atrophy in Whites was found to be zero, whereas it was 1.9% in African-Americans, giving a total prevalence of 0.8% across both groups.[13] In another population-based study from the United States, 0.83% of individuals were found to be bilaterally blind. Of these, optic atrophy was responsible for bilateral blindness in 3 persons
diff diag
Certain conditions may mimic optic atrophy and have to be ruled out, including:
Optic Nerve Pit
These are congenital anomalies characterized by a greyish round or oval depression, usually on the temporal aspect of the optic nerve head. Serous macular detachments develop in nearly half of the cases.
Myelinated Nerve Fibers
Optic nerve myelination usually stops at the level of the lamina cribrosa. However, myelination extends into the retina following the nerve fiber bundles in certain individuals. Clinically they appear as feathery white patches that may obscure the disc margin and vessels. Visual field examination will show the enlargement of the blind spot.
Optic Disc Drusen
These are usually calcific deposits within the substance of the optic nerve head. They are bilateral in around 75% of the individuals. Usually asymptomatic, they may present with the occasional blurring of vision. In the pediatric age group, drusen are buried within the disc and appear as pseudo-papilledema. In adult life, they get exposed, enlarge, and calcify. Later they may regress, leaving a pale disc. There is the filling of the optic cup, anomalous branching vasculature emanating from the central core, and hyaline bodies on the surface. Drusen also demonstrate fundus autofluorescence.
Optic Nerve Hypoplasia
This is a common optic nerve anomaly. The disc appears notably small due to the lack of axons passing through the optic nerve head.
Brighter-Than-Normal Luminosity
Using excessive illumination from the ophthalmoscope or slit lamp causes the disc to appear pale.

Ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) with ocular involve­ment, also known as ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, is a chronic autoimmune cicatrizing conjunctivitis. MMP can have serious, vision-threat­ening complications as well as systemic manifestations in the mouth, orophar­ynx, esophagus, skin, and genitoper­ineal region. Thus, it is important to diagnose MMP early in its clinical course, to treat it in a timely manner, and to prevent its adverse sequelae.
Causes 
caused
The cause of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune type II hypersensitivity response.[1] This autoimmune response occurs when a patient has a genetic predisposition and is exposed to an environmental trigger. Antibodies bind to surface antigens on the basement membrane of the conjunctiva. This causes recruitment and activation of complement proteins and inflammatory cytokines and leads to inflammation and scarring. There is evidence of an association to patients with HLA-DR4 and HLA-DQ7
and risk factors
Signs and symptoms
symptoms
In people with ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid, both eyes are affected, becoming red at first. Later, the conjunctivae shrink, making it difficult to pull the upper or lower eyelid away from the eye. Much later, the eyes become dry.
The cornea (the clear layer in front of the iris and pupil) can become cloudy, preventing light from reaching the retina and decreasing vision.
The conjunctivae can scar and shrink, causing eyelashes to turn inward (see Trichiasis) and further damage the cornea.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)

Table 1: Signs and Symptoms of MMP With Ocular InvolvementManagement
A multidisciplinary team that includes specialists in other medical fields such as rheumatology, hematology/oncol­ogy, and dermatology can be useful in managing MMP with ocular involve­ment, particularly its concurrent sys­temic symptoms. Such specialists can also contribute expertise in the use of systemic immunomodulatory agents, which are typically required to control MMP.
Topical therapy. Topical treatments such as artificial tears, punctal occlusion, steroids, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine A are useful adjuncts for relief of ocular surface disease symptoms. However, they have little effect in halting disease progression.
Systemic medications. Systemic anti-inflammatory and immunomod­ulatory medications are the mainstay of treatment for MMP with ocular involvement. A stepwise approach to systemic agents is taken depending on the severity of disease, presence of sight-threatening complications, and adverse effects of medications. The main categories of systemic agents are alkylating agents, antimetabolites, bio­logic immune modulators, interleukins, and T-cell inhibitors.
In mild ocular disease, dapsone is a common first-line anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent. Its adverse effects, which include gastroin­testinal distress, anemia, hepatotoxicity, and leukopenia, can decrease adherence to treatment. Sulfapyridine and sulfasalazine are alternate first-line agents that have a lower adverse effects profile.
In mild to moderate ocular disease, mycophenolate mofetil is an effective and well-tolerated first-line antimetabolite agent for patients without sight-threatening complications. Methotrex­ate is another antimetabolite that has been recommended as a first-line agent because of its efficacy; however, it has more significant side effects, the most serious of which include hepatic and pulmonary fibrosis.
In moderate to severe ocular disease, or in patients whose disease is refractory to an adequate trial of first-line agents, systemic corticosteroids with concurrent immunosuppressives are commonly used. Cyclophospha­mide, an alkylating agent, typically in combination with corticosteroids, is a mainstay for patients who have severe disease with sight-threatening complications. However, it should be used judiciously because of its serious adverse effects, including pancytopenia and hepatotoxicity.
In severe refractory ocular disease, or in those with serious adverse reactions to prior levels of treatment, biologics such as etanercept, rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin are used.6 Finally, a recent study found repository corticotropin to be a well-tolerated alternate or adjunctive treatment in severe refractory MMP with ocular involvement.7
Surgical management. It is important to note that surgery can be an inciting factor for further cycles of inflammation and cicatrization. There­fore, it is important to adequately con­trol active inflammation with medical therapy before proceeding with surgery.
Adjunctive surgical treatments for the sequelae of MMP with ocular involvement include eyelash epilation, entropion repair, tarsorrhaphy, and am­niotic membrane graft. Procedures for more severe disease include limbal stem cell transplantation, mucous membrane autografts, and cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation. The latter has been shown to be effective in treat­ment of ocular surface disease second­ary to limbal stem cell deficiency.8
In end-stage ocular disease, corneal transplants tend to fail due to graft vas­cularization. However, some evidence supports the utility of keratoprostheses, particularly the Boston keratoprosthesis type II, in select patients.9

Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Prevention tips
Prognosis
Progression of ocular disease has been reported in 20% to 30% of patients undergoing systemic therapy.10 It is important to monitor progression with close interdisciplinary follow-up employing serial photos and detailed clinical documentation. Of note, a significant percentage of patients with MMP with ocular involvement demon­strate a clear and quiet conjunctiva despite clinical and histologic evidence of fibrotic progression. This makes management difficult, as injection cannot be used as a sign of disease activity.1 It has been proposed that monitoring inflammatory markers such as myeloperoxidase could be a quantitative way to track disease activity.11

Possible complications
When to see a doctor / red flag
Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)
The differential diagnosis for cicatriz­ing conjunctivitis includes the follow­ing conditions:
infections (e.g., adenovirus, Chla­mydia trachomatis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae)
allergic eye disease (e.g., atopic kera­toconjunctivitis)
drug-induced disorders (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
autoimmune disorders (e.g., lichen planus, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis scleroderma, linear IgA dermatosis, MMP with ocular involve­ment)
chemical, thermal, or radiation injury
medicamentosa
pseudopemphigoid
neoplasia
ocular rosacea
trauma 
It is particularly difficult to distin­guish pseudopemphigoid from the ocular manifestations of MMP, as their presentations are identical. Pseudopem­phigoid is caused by long-term use of topical ophthalmic medications such as pilocarpine, timolol, and epineph­rine, and it resolves with cessation of the agent.5 Clinical information on laterality, skin and mucous membrane involvement, associated systemic dis­eases, medication use, and the presence of specific clinical signs can aid in dis­tinguishing the etiology of cicatrizing conjunctivitis.
Testing. In addition to clinical signs, a conjunctival biopsy sent to a pathol­ogy lab capable of performing direct immunofluorescence testing is used for definitive diagnosis. Conjunctival biopsy of an involved area, typically the inferior conjunctival fornix, is recommended, but biopsies of active oral lesions may also be taken. Linear staining of the epithelial basement membrane zone is consistent with diagnosis of MMP. A biopsy yielding negative immunohistochemical results has been reported in up to 60% of cases that were clinically consistent with the disease and its evolution. Negative biop­sy results can be attributed to inflam­matory destruction of the subepithelial membrane or therapies used prior to biopsy.6

Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
epidemiology
Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid predominantly affects females (2:1 over males), and the age of onset is around 60 years of age or older. There is no racial predilection. Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is considered a rare disease, and incidence is estimated to be about 1 per 10,000 to 50,000. 
dd
The differential diagnosis includes all conditions that cause an asymmetric bilateral chronic conjunctivitis with conjunctival cicatrization. These include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, trachoma,  graft-versus-host disease, dry eye syndrome, history of adenoviral conjunctivitis, chemical burn, medicamentosa (from topical glaucoma medications and anti-viral medications for herpetic eye disease), atopic keratoconjunctivitis, radiation exposure, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren syndrome. A distinguishing clinical feature of OCP is a progressive symblepharon.[5] Symblephara from the above etiologies may form and then remain stable. However, a few conditions in which progressive cicatrization occur include neoplasia, lichen planus, and paraneoplastic pemphigus

OVERACTIVE BLADDER 
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Overactive bladder (OAB) is a combination of symptoms that may cause you to urinate (pee) more frequently, have uncontrollable urges to pee, experience incontinence and have to pee at night.
Who does overactive bladder affect?
Overactive bladder is most common in people 65 and older. Women may have OAB at a younger age, usually around 45.
How common is overactive bladder?
Overactive bladder is common. It affects up to 33 million adults in the U.S., including as many as 30% of men and 40% of women. However, that number may be higher because many people may feel embarrassed and won’t get help.
How does overactive bladder affect my body?
Overactive bladder symptoms can cause stress and affect your quality of life.
Does overactive bladder go away?
No, overactive bladder doesn’t go away on its own. If you don’t treat OAB, your symptoms can get worse, the muscles in your bladder that help control when you pee can become weak and your pelvic floor tissues can get thinner.
Causes of Overactive bladder
Understanding the causes of an overactive bladder is crucial in finding effective solutions for this common condition. An overactive bladder refers to a sudden and uncontrollable urge to urinate, often resulting in frequent trips to the bathroom and potential leakage. Several factors can contribute to the development of an overactive bladder. One of the primary causes is muscle dysfunction in the bladder itself. When these muscles become overly sensitive or contract involuntarily, it can lead to frequent urges to urinate. Another common cause is nerve damage or irritation. Conditions such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries can disrupt the normal communication between the brain and the bladder, leading to an overactive bladder. Certain lifestyle choices and habits can also play a role in triggering symptoms. Consuming excessive amounts of caffeine or alcohol, as well as consuming spicy foods or artificial sweeteners, may irritate the bladder and worsen symptoms. In some cases, hormonal imbalances or medication side effects may contribute to an overactive bladder. Estrogen deficiency in women during menopause can weaken pelvic muscles and affect bladder control. Additionally, certain medications used for treating conditions like high blood pressure or depression may have urinary side effects that increase urinary frequency.
Risk Factors of Overactive bladder
One significant risk factor of overactive bladder is age. As individuals get older, the muscles in the bladder tend to weaken, leading to a higher chance of experiencing symptoms of overactive bladder. Additionally, hormonal changes that occur during menopause can contribute to bladder dysfunction. Gender also plays a role in the prevalence of overactive bladder. Women are more likely than men to develop this condition due to anatomical differences and the impact of pregnancy and childbirth on pelvic floor muscles. Certain medical conditions can also increase the risk of developing an overactive bladder. Conditions such as diabetes, obesity, urinary tract infections, and neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis can all contribute to bladder dysfunction. Lifestyle factors such as smoking and excessive caffeine or alcohol consumption have been linked to an increased risk of overactive bladder. These substances can irritate the bladder lining and exacerbate symptoms. Lastly, a family history of overactive bladder may indicate a genetic predisposition for developing this condition. If close relatives have experienced similar symptoms, it is important to be vigilant in monitoring one's own urinary health.
Symptoms of Overactive bladder
One of the most common symptoms of an overactive bladder is a sudden and intense urge to urinate, often accompanied by an inability to hold urine for long periods. This urgent need to relieve oneself can occur at any time, day or night, leading to interrupted sleep patterns and constant feelings of urgency. Frequent trips to the bathroom are another telltale sign of an overactive bladder. Individuals may find themselves needing to urinate more frequently than usual, sometimes as often as every hour. This increased frequency can disrupt daily activities, making it difficult for individuals to focus on work or enjoy social engagements without constant interruptions. In some cases, an overactive bladder may also lead to involuntary leakage or urinary incontinence. This can range from small amounts of urine leakage during physical activities such as coughing or sneezing (known as stress incontinence) to a complete loss of control over the bladder (known as urge incontinence). These episodes can be embarrassing and emotionally distressing for those affected. It's important not to dismiss these symptoms as a normal part of aging or something that cannot be addressed. With proper diagnosis and treatment options available, individuals suffering from an overactive bladder can find relief and regain control over their lives.

Diagnosis for Overactive bladder
Diagnosing an overactive bladder can be a crucial step in finding relief and managing this common condition. With proper diagnosis, individuals can receive the appropriate treatment and regain control over their bladder function. When it comes to diagnosing an overactive bladder, healthcare professionals employ various methods to gather relevant information and make an accurate assessment. One common diagnostic tool is a detailed medical history review, where patients are asked about their symptoms, frequency of urination, fluid intake patterns, and any previous treatments they have tried. Additionally, healthcare providers may use a bladder diary to track urinary habits over a certain period. This diary helps identify patterns and triggers that may contribute to the overactive bladder symptoms. It records information such as the amount of fluids consumed, frequency of bathroom visits, urgency levels, and any instances of urinary leakage. In some cases, further tests may be necessary for a comprehensive diagnosis. These tests can include urodynamic studies which measure the pressure inside the bladder during filling and emptying or urine analysis to rule out any underlying infections or other conditions that could be causing similar symptoms.

Treatments for Overactive bladder
Finding an effective treatment for overactive bladder can greatly improve the quality of life for those who suffer from this condition. The constant urge to urinate and the frequent trips to the bathroom can be disruptive and frustrating. However, there are various treatment options available that can help manage and alleviate the symptoms of overactive bladder. One common approach to treating overactive bladder is through lifestyle modifications. This includes making changes to one's diet, such as avoiding caffeine and spicy foods, as they can irritate the bladder. Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight and practicing regular pelvic floor exercises can also contribute to better bladder control. In some cases, medication may be prescribed by healthcare professionals to help relax the muscles of the bladder or reduce urinary frequency. These medications work by targeting specific receptors in the bladder, helping to restore normal function and reduce urgency. For individuals who do not respond well to lifestyle changes or medication, more advanced treatment options may be considered. These include procedures such as nerve stimulation or Botox injections into the bladder muscles, which can help regulate its activity. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional who specializes in urology or urinary disorders for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. They will be able to assess your specific situation and recommend appropriate interventions based on your individual needs.
Preventive Measures for Overactive bladder
One important aspect of preventing an overactive bladder is maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This includes adopting a balanced diet, rich in fiber and low in irritants such as caffeine and alcohol. Regular exercise can also help strengthen pelvic floor muscles, which play a crucial role in bladder control. Another preventive measure is staying hydrated while being mindful of fluid intake. While it may seem counterintuitive to drink less water when dealing with an overactive bladder, reducing excessive fluid consumption can help minimize the urge to urinate frequently. In addition to lifestyle changes, there are various techniques that individuals can try to manage their overactive bladder symptoms. These include bladder training exercises, where one gradually increases the time between bathroom visits, as well as practicing pelvic floor exercises known as Kegels. Seeking professional advice from healthcare providers is essential for developing an effective prevention plan tailored to individual needs. They can provide guidance on potential triggers or underlying medical conditions that may contribute to overactive bladder symptoms.

Do's & Don'ts
When it comes to managing an overactive bladder, there are certain do's and don'ts that can greatly improve your quality of life. By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your symptoms and regain control over your bladder. 

If you or someone you know is dealing with frequent and urgent urges to urinate, it's important to consult with a Gynecologist to address potential concerns related to overactive bladder.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
A total of 53 studies, encompassing 610,438 participants, were ultimately included in the analysis. The meta-analysis determined the global prevalence of OAB to be 20% (95% CI 0.18–0.21). Over the past 20 years, there has been an increase in OAB prevalence, rising from 18.1% (95% CI 0.13–0.23) to 23.9% (95% CI 0.19–0.29). Among women, the prevalence of OAB was 21.9% (95% CI 0.20–0.24), indicating higher rates compared to men (OR = 16.1, 95% CI 0.15–0.18). The study also found higher prevalence rates among overweight and obese individuals (OR = 18.6, 95% CI 0.13–0.24) and those aged 60 years and above (OR = 28.3, 95% CI 0.24–0.33). Middle-income countries exhibited higher prevalence rates compared to high-income countries.
Conclusions
The study highlights higher risks of OAB among obese individuals, women, and the elderly. OAB prevalence has shown an increasing trend over the past 20 years.

PAPILLEDEMA
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Papilledema refers to the swelling of both optic discs in your eyes due to increased intracranial pressure (intracranial hypertension). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is constantly being released and then reabsorbed and normal levels help protect the brain from trauma.
The optic disc, or nerve head, is located where the optic nerve enters the back of the eye. The optic nerve is a pathway that connects the eye to the brain.
Intracranial hypertension usually results in bilateral papilledema (disc swelling of both optic discs). Swelling of the optic disc in only one eye (unilateral) is usually not the result of intracranial hypertension. Because of this, its name is optic disc edema.
Papilledema can be considered a medical emergency because intracranial hypertension can be serious, even potentially life-threatening.
Who does papilledema affect?
Papilledema is more common in women. They’re usually 20 to 44 years old and are likely to be overweight (a BMI greater than 25) or obesity (a BMI greater than 30). The incidence of papilledema in this group is 13 per 100,000.
The incidence is much lower among other groups in the U.S. The incidence of papilledema among the U.S. population as a whole is 0.9 per 100,000 people.
Causes
What causes papilledema?
High intracranial pressure causes papilledema. Related issues may include:
High blood pressure (malignant hypertension).
Tumors.
Infection, bleeding or inflammation in the brain or the meninges (the tissues that protect the brain and spinal cord).
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. This condition refers to a blood clot in a vein in your brain.
Iron-deficiency anemia.
Medication usage. There have been links with retin-A and retinoids, toxic amounts of vitamin A, tetracycline antibiotics, COVID-19 and corticosteroids.
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). This condition literally means that the patient develops intracranial hypertension without a clear reason or identifiable cause. The word “idiopathic” means that there’s no clear reason or cause.
Is papilledema hereditary?
Papilledema isn’t hereditary.
Do migraines cause papilledema?
Migraines don’t cause papilledema.
 and risk factors
Signs and symptoms
You may have no symptoms (be asymptomatic), though you may have:
Headaches: Headaches related to papilledema may be worse in the mornings and when you’re lying down.
Transient visual obscurations: These events are periods of about five to 15 seconds where your vision gets blurry, goes gray, or blacks out. An obscuration is similar to what happens during a total eclipse when the moon blocks the sun from your sight. These events usually happen when you change posture. You can have these events in both eyes (bilateral) or in only one eye (unilateral).
Double vision (diplopia): This may happen if the intracranial hypertension results in a cranial nerve palsy that impairs the eye muscles.
Nausea and vomiting.
Neurological symptoms: These may include problems with movement or thinking.
The vision loss worsens as the condition progresses.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
You may find out you have papilledema while your provider is evaluating you for other conditions, like illnesses that cause headaches and vision problems.
Your eye doctor will perform an eye exam with additional tests that may include visual field testing. They’ll be able to see if your optic disc looks swollen.
If your optic disc seems to be swollen, your provider will send you for an imaging examination, most likely a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.
Your provider may order a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).
Other tests may include blood tests to determine levels of iron and other substances in your blood.
How is papilledema graded (staged)?
Providers might use a version of the Frisén scale to grade or stage papilledema (that rates severity). The stages run from Grade 0 where the disc is normal but the edges may be blurred to Grade V where the whole disc is elevated, and you can’t see the blood vessels in the disc or those leaving the disc.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
For papilledema due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, your provider may prescribe a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide. They may also work with you to achieve and maintain a healthy weight as a long-term strategy.
If these methods don’t work, your provider may suggest surgical procedures to relieve and decrease intracranial hypertension.
For papilledema due to other causes, your provider will treat the underlying cause.
It’s important to treat papilledema because untreated papilledema can lead to partial or complete blindness in one or both eyes.
Prevention
You can reduce your risk of developing papilledema by:
Keeping your blood pressure under control (avoid malignant hypertension).
Achieving and keeping a healthy weight.
Regular eye exams are important. As with most medical conditions, early diagnosis leads to better outcomes.
Outlook / Prognosis
If you and your provider catch papilledema early, the outlook is good. Your provider will treat the condition primarily by addressing the issue that caused it.
It’s important to treat papilledema because of the potential for blindness and other neurologic effects.
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider about papilledema or its potential causes?
If you have new or worsening headaches, along with nausea and vomiting, you should seek immediate medical care. You should have any change in your vision assessed by a healthcare provider.
Possible complications

Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Papilledema from various causes of IH may develop at any age, in either sex, and in any racial or ethnic group. Although high ICP can occur in infants and very young children, open fontanels may mitigate the development of papilledema in these patients despite IH.
In contrast, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) predominantly affects obese women of childbearing age . In the USA, the annual incidence per 100,000 persons has been estimated to be 0.9 in the general population and 3.5 in females 15–44 years of age  Durcan et al estimated that the incidence of IIH is up to 13 per 100,000 in obese women aged 20–44 years of age who were ≥10% overweight and up to 19.3 per 100,000 if ≥20% over ideal weight. The incidence of IIH varies from country to country, probably related to the prevalence of obesity. The incidence was 1.56/100,000 persons/year, 2.86/100,000 in women, and 11.9/100,000 in obese women in the Sheffield UK study. The reported annual incidence of IIH in Mid

PROPTOSIS
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Proptosis is when one or both of your eyes bulge from their natural position. The condition can affect your appearance, leaving you with a startled expression that doesn’t go away.
Proptosis can also make it difficult for you to blink. When you can’t blink, the protective outer layer of your eyes (corneas) doesn’t receive the lubrication it needs to do its job. You may be at risk for cornea damage. Some people experience other complications, like low vision or double vision (diplopia).
Other names for proptosis include bulging eyes, protruding eyes and exophthalmos.
Causes
Causes of Proptosis
Understanding the underlying causes of proptosis is essential for effective treatment. The causes can be broadly categorized into systemic diseases, local orbital diseases, and other miscellaneous conditions.
Thyroid Eye Disease
Thyroid eye disease (TED), also known as Graves ophthalmopathy, is one of the most common causes of proptosis. This autoimmune disorder affects the tissues around the eyes, leading to inflammation and swelling.
Orbital Tumors
Tumours within the eye socket can push the eye forward, leading to proptosis. These tumours can be benign or malignant and may originate from various tissues such as muscles, nerves, or fat.
Infections
Orbital cellulitis, an infection of the tissues surrounding the eye, can cause significant swelling and proptosis. This condition is often accompanied by pain, redness, and fever.
Trauma
Injuries to the eye or surrounding structures can lead to swelling and proptosis. Fractures of the orbital bones can also cause the eye to protrude.
Vascular Disorders
Conditions such as carotid-cavernous fistula, a direct connection between the arterial and venous systems, can lead to increased pressure in the eye socket and cause proptosis.
Other Causes
Proptosis can also result from other conditions such as cysts, inflammatory diseases like sarcoidosis, and congenital disorders.
What causes bulging eyes?
The most common cause of bulging eyes is an autoimmune disease in which your body’s immune system attacks cells in your thyroid gland and the tissue behind your eye. Proptosis in people with thyroid issues is also called thyroid eye disease (TED). People who have thyroid issues are the most likely to experience bulging eyes. Proptosis causes include:
Graves’ disease.
Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland).
Eye socket infections.
Injuries, especially if they cause bleeding behind your eye.
Tumors, which may include neuroblastoma and some soft tissue sarcomas.
and risk factors
Signs and symptoms
When your eyes bulge, the white part of your eyes is more visible. In addition, your eyeballs push forward from your eye sockets. You may be able to see less of your upper eyelids because your eyes look like they’re wide open.
Other symptoms of a bulging eye that you may experience include:
A gritty sensation when you move your eye.
Dry, irritated or watery eye (epiphora).
Eyelid swelling or redness.
Muscle tightness that may prevent you from moving your eye.
Sensitivity to light.
Headache.
Fever.
Are there symptoms I should be concerned about?
Symptoms of proptosis that need a prompt evaluation from a healthcare provider include:
A throbbing sensation in your eyes.
Eye bulging that comes on suddenly.
Pain or redness.
Symptoms in one eye.
Loss or decrease of vision.
Blurred or double vision.
Difficulty focusing on objects.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Diagnosis and Tests
Your healthcare provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history to determine the potential causes of your bulging eyes.
They’ll also perform an eye exam that may include:
Using a slit lamp to magnify your eye’s surface and structures.
Assessing eye and eyelid movement.
Checking for redness, soreness and irritation.
What other tests might I need?
Your healthcare provider may perform or recommend other tests, including:
Exophthalmometry: This test uses a special instrument to measure how far your eyeball protrudes from your eye socket.
Blood tests: This will likely include a workup for thyroid disease.
Imaging studies: Imaging tests, like an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or a CT scan (computed tomography scan), can check for bleeding, tumors or signs of infection.
Other lab tests: Lab tests, like a blood or tissue culture, can confirm or rule out an infection.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
Your treatment may include:
Artificial tears, including drops or gel, to relieve dry eyes and protect your corneas.
Antibiotics if you have an infection.
Medical treatments for underlying conditions, like medications for hyperthyroidism.
Intravenous (IV) medications like corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory medication) or teprotumumab (Tepezza®) for thyroid eye disease.
Are there other nonsurgical treatments for bulging eyes?
Other therapies may include:
Double vision treatments: These treatments include prisms that attach to your glasses and redirect light as it enters your eyes.
Immunosuppressive drugs: These drugs may lessen the impact of immune system attacks on your eyes.
Corticosteroids: You may receive steroids by injection or through a vein in your arm to relieve swelling or restore eyesight.
Will I need surgery?
You may need surgery to:
Create more space behind your eye in the eye socket.
Treat double vision.
Protect your corneas if you can’t fully close your eyelids.
Remove a tumor.
Prevention tips
Prevention
Steps you can take to prevent proptosis from getting worse include:
Keeping thyroid levels in check: If you have thyroid disease, follow your healthcare provider’s care instructions. Take daily medications and stay current with blood testing to check thyroid levels.
Quitting smoking: Smoking can make proptosis treatments less effective. Quitting can have a significant and positive impact on your body’s response.
Prognosis
Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook for people with protruding eyes?
You’re more likely to have good outcomes if you receive timely treatment to address the cause of your symptoms. Getting the right therapies for your needs can also help you avoid complications.
Can a bulging eye go back to normal?
Yes. But even with successful treatment, it may take a while for your eye to return to its usual position. In some cases, it takes years.
Living With
What is life like with proptosis?
Protruding eyes can change your appearance and cause issues with your confidence and self-esteem. If it affects your vision, you may experience unexpected changes in your daily life. These changes can leave you feeling upset, anxious or depressed.
How can I cope with challenges?
Support from a mental health professional or social worker can help you feel better:
Mental health professionals may use cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to help you find methods for coping with negative thoughts and feelings.
Social workers can connect you with local resources in your area, including support groups, or virtual resources if you’re unable to drive due to vision issues.
Possible complications
What are the complications and long-term effects of proptosis?
Most people don’t experience complications or long-term effects. In rare cases, double vision or vision loss may be permanent. It’s also possible to experience cornea damage if you can’t blink and lubricating eye drops aren’t effective.

Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)
differential diagnosis
Autoimmune, inflammatory conditions, trauma, and neoplastic disease are the most common differentials that must merit consideration in the differential diagnosis. These include thyroid-associated orbitopathy linked with Graves disease; infectious conditions such as orbital and preseptal cellulitis; vascular malformations including carotid-cavernous fistula; benign and malignant tumors including malignancy including capillary haemangioma, neuroblastoma, leukemia, lymphoma, mucocele, pseudotumors, and secondary metastatic tumors that may give rise to metastatic deposits in the orbit. Other rare differentials may include Crouzon syndrome and Apert syndrome. Periorbital fractures due to trauma may result in periorbital hemorrhage that can potentially protrude the globe.

Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
epidemiology
The incidence of exophthalmos may vary depending upon the underlying cause. In unilateral exophthalmos, under one-third of patients will have thyrotoxic activity. Ninety percent of bilateral exophthalmos was historically a result of endocrine abnormalities. The mean position of the globe, as measured using an exophthalmometer, is 16 mm. There is variation between the sexes and between races

Proptosis (Bulging Eyes): Causes & Treatment
PROSTATITIS
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Prostatitis is a condition of the prostate gland most often linked with swelling and irritation, called inflammation. Prostatitis can make it painful or hard to urinate. It also may cause pain in the groin, pelvic area or genitals. Bacterial infections cause some but not all prostatitis.
The prostate gland, about the size of a walnut, sits just below the bladder in people assigned male at birth. It surrounds the top part of the tube that drains urine from the bladder, called the urethra. The prostate and other sex glands make the fluid that carries sperm during ejaculation. This fluid is called semen.
Types
There are four main types of prostatitis:
Acute bacterial prostatitis. Bacteria causes this infection of the prostate. It most often has sudden, serious symptoms.
Chronic bacterial prostatitis. This is a bacterial infection that lasts or comes back. The symptoms often are less serious than are those of acute bacterial prostatitis.
Chronic prostatitis, also called chronic pelvic pain syndrome. This causes pelvic pain and urinary tract symptoms that last or come back. But there's no sign of infection.
Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. This has signs of an inflamed prostate with no urinary symptoms.
Causes

Prostate gland
Causes depend on the type of prostatitis.
Acute bacterial prostatitis. Common strains of bacteria are most often the cause. The infection may have spread from other parts of the urinary or reproductive systems.
Chronic bacterial prostatitis. This most often has the same cause as acute bacterial infection. It may happen when treatment for an acute infection isn't long enough or fails to kill all the bacteria.
Chronic prostatitis, also called chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Research suggests that the cause may involve several factors. These include an earlier infection, a condition of the nervous system or immune system, psychological stress, or issues with hormones.
Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. This has no known cause. It may show up during an exam for other medical conditions.
Risk factors
Risk factors for prostatitis include:
Young or middle adulthood.
Earlier prostatitis.
Infection of the urinary or reproductive system.
HIV infection or AIDS.
Use of a tube put into the urethra to drain the bladder, called a urinary catheter.
Having a sample of prostate tissue taken for study in a lab, called a biopsy.
Other risk factors for chronic prostatitis, also called chronic pelvic pain syndrome, may include:
Mental stress.
Nerve damage in the pelvic region due to surgery or injury.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of prostatitis depend on the type of condition. They may include:
Pain or burning feeling when urinating, called dysuria.
Trouble urinating, such as dribbling or trouble starting a stream of urine or keeping it going.
Urinating often, mostly at night, called nocturia.
Urgent need to urinate.
Cloudy urine.
Blood in the urine.
Pain in the belly, groin or lower back.
Pain in the area between the scrotum and rectum, called the perineum.
Pain or discomfort of the penis or testicles.
Painful ejaculation.
Fever, chills, muscle aches and other flu-like symptoms with acute bacterial prostatitis.
Diagnosis
Several conditions can cause symptoms like those of prostatitis. Your healthcare professional may send you to a specialist in urinary and reproductive system conditions, called a urologist. Diagnosis involves a physical exam, review of your symptoms and medical history, and tests.
Test for diagnosing bacterial infections
Diagnostic tests to assess for infection may include:
Digital rectal exam. With this procedure, a healthcare professional puts a gloved finger that's oiled into your rectum to see if there's inflammation of the prostate.
Urine test. A urine sample is tested for infection and what type it is.
Blood test. Blood samples may show signs of infection and other prostate conditions.
Prostatic specimen test. Sometimes, a healthcare professional gently massages the prostate during a rectal exam. This is to release prostate fluid into the urethra. A urine sample collected after the massage is tested to check for infection in the prostate fluid. This test is not for acute bacterial prostatitis because it can spread germs in the blood.
Other tests
If the first tests show no sign of infection, you may have other tests, including:
Urodynamic tests. These tests measure how well the bladder and urethra hold and release urine. These tests can help show the source of issues with urinating.
Imaging. Imaging tests can show something that isn't usual in the prostate and growths or other issues in the pelvic region that may be causing pain.
Treatment
Treatment for prostatitis depends on the type you have and your symptoms.
Treating infection
For acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis, you take antibiotics. Acute prostatitis may need antibiotics given through a tube in a vein, called an IV, in the hospital for a short time.
The course of antibiotic treatment is most often 4 to 6 weeks. Sometimes it can be longer. Take all the medicine to get rid of the infection and lower the risk of chronic bacterial prostatitis.
Treating urinary symptoms
Medicines called alpha-blockers help relax the bladder neck and the muscle fibers where the prostate joins the bladder. This treatment might ease symptoms, such as pain while urinating or trouble urinating.
Alpha-blockers most often treat people with chronic prostatitis, also called chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Alpha-blockers also can ease urinary symptoms of bacterial infections.
Treating pain
Your healthcare professional may prescribe pain medicine or suggest medicines you can get without a prescription. These include acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others).
Managing psychological symptoms
Your healthcare professional may advise that you see a mental healthcare professional. This can help you manage stress, depression or worry that may be linked with long-term pain.
Lifestyle and home remedies
Do the following to help ease some symptoms of prostatitis:
Soak in a warm bath, called a sitz bath, or use a heating pad.
Don't have or limit alcohol, caffeine, and spicy or high-acid foods. They can irritate the bladder.
Drink plenty of water. This will make you urinate more and help flush bacteria from your bladder.
Alternative medicine
Alternative therapies that show some promise for easing symptoms of prostatitis include:
Biofeedback. You use this mind-body technique to help you control some of your body's work, such as heart rate and muscle responses. During biofeedback, you're connected to electrical pads that help you learn how your body responds.
Acupuncture. This treatment involves putting very thin needles through your skin at certain points on your body. Acupuncture may help ease pain.
Herbal treatments. Some studies suggest that rye grass pollen extract, also called cernilton, may help manage the pain of chronic prostatitis, also called chronic pelvic pain syndrome. There isn't enough proof that other herbal treatments ease symptoms of prostatitis.
Talk about your use of alternative medicine practices and herbal treatments with your healthcare professional before trying any.
Prevention tips
Prognosis
Complications
Complications of acute or chronic prostatitis can include:
Bacterial infection of the blood, called bacteremia.
Irritation of the coiled tube attached to the back of the testicle, called epididymitis.
Pus-filled cavity in the prostate, called a prostatic abscess.
Infection that spreads to the upper pelvic bone or lower spine.
Complications of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome may include:
Worry or depression.
Sexual dysfunction, such as not being able get and keep an erection, called erectile dysfunction.
Changes in sperm and semen that may affect having children, called infertility.
There's no proof that prostatitis can lead to prostate cancer. Researchers are looking into whether long-term irritation of the prostate is a risk factor for cancer.
When to see a doctor
Several conditions can cause symptoms like those of prostatitis. Get a diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.
Get care right away if you:
Are not able to pass urine.
Have a fever and trouble urinating or pain while urinating.
Have blood in your urine.
Have a lot of discomfort or pain in the pelvic area or genitals.

Pterygium
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
What is a pterygium (surfer’s eye)?
A pterygium (ter-IJ-ee-um) is a raised, fleshy growth on your eye’s conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of your eye. The growth may look whiteish or pinkish and may have visible blood vessels in it. It typically starts in the corner of your eye and grows toward your iris (the colored part).
Pterygium typically has a triangular or wing-like shape. The word, “pterygium,” comes from the Greek words pteryx, meaning “wing,” and pterygion, meaning “fin.” Another name for pterygium is surfer’s eye. This is because surfers are often in the elements that cause pterygium — sun, wind, sand and salt.
Who gets pterygium (surfer’s eye disease)?
Surfers do get pterygia (the plural of pterygium) more often. But anyone can get one if they spend a lot of time outdoors without eye protection. It’s more common in older adults, who’ve had more exposure to the elements over time, and also in those who live near the equator, where sunlight is more intense.
How serious is a pterygium?
A pterygium isn’t an invasive growth. It’s not cancerous, and it won’t spread to other nearby tissues. But it can continue to grow across the surface of your eye. If it reaches your cornea (the clear part that covers the colored part), it can damage your vision. In this case, you might need surgery to remove it.
Causes 
What causes a pterygium eye?
Pterygium is an overgrowth of your conjunctiva tissue. Causes include:
Long-term exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) light.
Chronic irritation from hot and dry weather, wind and dust.
Other possible risk factors include:
Age over 60.
Genetics.
Vitamin A deficiency.
Human papilloma virus (HPV).
risk factors
The primary risk is recurrence (return of the pterygium after surgery). If this happens, you may need another surgery. Fortunately, with new and improved surgical techniques, rates of pterygium recurrence are declining. Current research suggests the rate of recurrence is somewhere between 2% and 15%.
Recurrence is more likely to occur if you don’t take your prescribed eyedrops as directed, or if your eye has direct sun exposure after surgery. It’s important to follow your provider’s instructions on this. You can still spend time outside, but if you do, make sure to wear protection, like a hat or sunglasses.
Some of the medications that providers prescribe to prevent recurrence can also have side effects. Antimetabolites like mitomycin can cause “melting” or thinning of your sclera (scleromalacia) after pterygium surgery. Steroid eye drops can raise your eye pressure or lead to cataracts forming.
Signs and symptoms
What symptoms can a pterygium cause?
You might not feel your pterygium at first. You might only notice a raised, fleshy, wedge-shaped growth at the corner of your eye. When symptoms do develop, they can be mild to severe. They might include:
Inflammation and swelling (conjunctivitis).
Redness or bloodshot eye.
Dry eye.
Watery eye.
A feeling like there’s something in your eye.
Eye itching.
Eye burning.
Eye pain.
Over time, you might also notice:
An increase in the size and spread of the lesion.
Difficulties or discomfort with contact lenses.
Vision changes, like blurred or double vision.
Not everyone develops these symptoms. Some pterygia grow more than others.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
How is a pterygium diagnosed?
Your eye care provider can diagnose a pterygium with a slit lamp exam. A slit lamp is a type of microscope that focuses a narrow line (slit) of bright light on your eye. It helps your provider look at the front and inside of your eye. This is part of a standard eye exam. They’ll recognize a pterygium on sight.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for pterygium?
Pterygium treatment depends on how much it’s affecting you. If it’s not causing you any symptoms, it probably doesn’t need treatment. But your eye care provider will keep an eye on it. They’ll schedule regular eye exams to check on how the pterygium is growing and whether it’s affecting your vision.
If the pterygium irritates your eye, your provider might prescribe:
Over-the-counter (OTC) eye drops or eye ointments.
A short course of steroid eye drops for severe symptoms.
Providers also recommend wearing hats and wraparound UV sunglasses to protect your eyes from further UV damage. This may help slow the growth of your pterygium or prevent it from growing faster. If your pterygium is growing toward your cornea, they’ll recommend removing it before it gets there.
How do you get rid of a pterygium?
The only way to get rid of a pterygium is with eye surgery. A pterygium won’t go away on its own. You may want to have your pterygium removed if it seriously irritates your eye, if it’s growing aggressively or if it’s already affecting your vision. You may also choose to have it removed for cosmetic reasons.
What’s involved in pterygium surgery?
An ophthalmologist can remove your pterygium. If you don’t have one, your optometrist can refer you.
During pterygium surgery, your ophthalmologist will:
Give you anesthesia, so you won’t feel anything.
Remove the abnormal tissue from the surface of your eye.
Cover the hole left in your conjunctiva with other tissue.
Surgeons use different methods for patching the hole left after they remove your pterygium.
Options include:
Conjuctival autograft. Your surgeon may take a piece of conjunctiva tissue from elsewhere on your eyeball, usually from behind your upper eyelid, to patch the hole. This method leaves another wound behind your eyelid, but it’s well protected there and heals on its own.
Amniotic tissue graft. Surgeons use donated amniotic membrane tissue (from a placenta) to cover the hole while it heals. This tissue acts as a bandage that protects your conjunctiva until it can grow back to cover the hole. This method is helpful when the gap is too big for an autograft.
Pterygium surgery takes about an hour. After surgery, you’ll wear an eye patch for a few days while you recover. It takes four to six weeks for your eye to heal completely.
Your provider will prescribe medications to take home with you, including antibiotics to prevent infection and steroid eye drops to prevent the pterygium from growing back.
Prevention tips
Prevention
What can I do to lower my risk of pterygium?
You can lower your risk of developing a pterygium — and slow its growth if you have one — by protecting your eyes from the elements, especially sunlight. Wear UV protection sunglasses when you’re in the sun. Protect your eyes from dry, windy, dusty climates by lubricating them with artificial tears.
Prognosis
Outlook / Prognosis
How long does a pterygium last?
A pterygium won’t go away unless a surgeon removes it. It’s likely to grow slowly throughout your life. Most people won’t need treatment for a pterygium. If it irritates your eye, you can usually manage these symptoms with over-the-counter medications. If it’s more than a minor nuisance, you can remove it.
What can I expect if I have a pterygium removed?
There’s a small chance your pterygium will come back after surgery. If it does, it usually starts to appear within four months, and no later than 12 months after surgery. If you need to have another surgery, your surgeon will take extra measures to make sure the pterygium doesn’t come back again.
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider about my pterygium?
Your provider will want to see you regularly to check on your pterygium and measure its growth — usually about once a year, unless it grows faster or slower than normal. Make sure to see them sooner if you start to develop new symptoms, or if your current medications aren’t working for you anymore.
While evaluating a case of pterygium, the following conditions should be ruled out:
Pseudo-pterygium
It is a fold of bulbar conjunctiva which is attached to the cornea. It is an inflammatory reaction where adhesions are formed between bulbar conjunctiva and cornea. A 'probe' test can be performed where the probe can be passed beneath the tissue in pseudo-pterygium but not in pterygium. It can appear in any quadrant of the eye and is non-progressive in nature.
Pinguecula
It is a yellowish colored growth on bulbar conjunctiva close to the limbus. It is said to be a deposit of fat, protein or calcium. It is commonly found nasally. The patient is usually asymptomatic but may present with mild redness and foreign body sensation when inflamed.
Nodular Episcleritis
A discrete area of inflammation in episcleral tissue is seen, which is elevated. Only vascular congestion may be present in cases of simple episcleritis. If phenylephrine 2.5% is instilled, there will be blanching of the superficial episcleral vascular network. Usually, this condition is mildly painful, unlike pterygium.
Marginal Keratitis
It is an inflammatory disease of the peripheral cornea. Stromal infiltrates with the breakdown of the epithelium, and ulceration is seen. Infiltrate on the corneal surface is separated from limbus by a clear zone.
Phlycten
It is a result of delayed-type immune reaction leading to nodular inflammation of the conjunctiva. 
Conjunctival carcinoma in situ/ Bowen epithelioma
It is a rare presentation. It presents as a gelatinous-appearing mass. 
Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN)

Possible complications
What happens if a pterygium isn’t removed?
Most pterygia will continue to grow, but some grow much more slowly than others. It’s possible that your pterygium will never bother you much. Because of the risk that it might grow back, healthcare providers don’t recommend surgery for a pterygium that’s small and doesn’t cause symptoms.
However, a pterygium that keeps spreading across your eye can cause problems. It may irritate your eye or obscure your vision. If it reaches your cornea, it can pull at it and change the shape, causing astigmatism. It can also scar your cornea, which can affect your vision even after it’s removed.

epidemiology
Pterygium is a degenerative disorder of the conjunctiva. It is usually seen as a triangular fleshy fibrovascular proliferation from the bulbar conjunctiva onto the cornea, located mostly on the nasal side. Though it occurs worldwide, its prevalence is high in the “pterygium belt” between 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south of the equator.1 The prevalence of pterygium is reported to be 3% in Australians, 23% in blacks in United States, 15% in Tibetans in China, 18% in Mongolians in China, 30% in Japanese and 7% in Singaporean Chinese and Indians.
In a population-based study from rural central India, prevalence of pterygium increased from 6.7±0.8% in the age group from 30–39 years to 25.3±2.1% in the age group of 70–79 years. Three population based studies have described the incidence of pterygium. Barbados eye study has described the nine year incidence of pterygium to be 11.6% (95% CI, 10.1–13.1), the Beijing Eye Study described the 10 year incidence of pterygium in the adult Chinese population to be 4.9%, and the five year cumulative incidence in Bai Chinese population in a rural community was 6.8% (95% CI, 5.2–8.4)

PTOSIS
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Ptosis is a condition in which your upper eyelid droops, sags or falls over your eye. It usually happens because your levator muscle — the muscle that lifts your eyelid — doesn’t work as it should. The condition can limit your vision or block it completely, depending on how much your lid droops. Ptosis of the eyelid can affect one or both upper eyelids. It can also be worse in one eye than the other.
Other names for the condition include blepharoptosis, upper eyelid ptosis or droopy eyelid.
Types of ptosis
Ptosis can affect both children and adults.
Congenital ptosis: Congenital ptosis means your child was born with the condition. Problems with the development of the levator muscle cause congenital ptosis.
Acquired ptosis: This type of ptosis affects adults later in life. It occurs when your levator muscle weakens or separates away from your eyelid.
Causes 
What causes ptosis?
Ptosis causes depend on the type. Some babies are born with ptosis in one or both eyelids (congenital ptosis).
Ptosis can occur later in life (acquired ptosis) if the muscles or ligaments that normally raise your eyelid are weakened by injury or disease. Sometimes, the drooping is a result of damage to the nerves that control your eyelid muscles.
Diseases and conditions that may result in ptosis include:
Stye.
Horner syndrome.
Myasthenia gravis.
Stroke.
Tumor.
External ophthalmoplegia.
Most ptosis just happens with aging. As you age, the skin and muscles of your eyelids stretch and weaken. Sometimes, previous eye surgery speeds up this change because the instruments used to keep your eye open during surgery can stretch your eyelid.
What happens if ptosis is left untreated?
If your child has congenital ptosis, the sooner you have it treated, the better. If left untreated, it could impact their vision development and lead to other issues. Mild acquired ptosis is less likely to cause vision problems, and you may not need to seek treatment. But severe ptosis can cause serious complications if you don’t treat it. Complications of ptosis may include:
Astigmatism: When your eyelid puts pressure on the front of your eye, it can change the shape of your eye. This can cause distortion in your vision (your vision may be stretched or wavy).
Amblyopia: Astigmatism and other refractive errors (issues focusing due to a need for glasses) can cause amblyopia, or lazy eye.
Chin-up position: When your child has to tilt their chin up to be able to see beyond their drooping eyelids, it can cause neck problems, tightened forehead muscles and developmental delays.
risk factors
Signs and symptoms
What are the symptoms of ptosis?
You can typically tell if you or your child has ptosis by your eyelid’s appearance. It may cover only your upper eye, or it may cover your entire pupil. Other ptosis symptoms may include:
Excessive rubbing of your eyes.
Increased tearing.
Decreased or impaired vision.
Tiredness and achiness around your eyes.
Children may tip their heads back to see.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Diagnosis and Tests
How is ptosis diagnosed?
Healthcare providers can typically detect ptosis by the appearance of a drooping eyelid. If both eyelids are affected, it may be more difficult to diagnose. Your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam. They may refer you to an eye care specialist (ophthalmologist) who will perform an eye exam and may request additional tests.
What tests will be done to diagnose this condition?
Tests that your eye care provider may perform include:
Slit lamp examination.
Visual field testing.
Ocular motility (eye movement) test.
Tensilon test (uses the drug Tensilon, also known as edrophonium, to diagnose myasthenia gravis).
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
How do you fix ptosis?
Ptosis treatment usually depends on how well your eyelid muscles are functioning. If the condition doesn’t affect your vision and the appearance doesn’t bother you, you might not need treatment at all.
If ptosis causes a problem with vision, appearance or both, your eye care specialist may recommend treatment. The type of treatment depends on whether the ptosis is caused by a disease or by aging. Treating ptosis caused by aging usually involves surgery.
Ptosis surgery
Ptosis surgery is performed under local anesthesia with sedation (you’re awake but you don’t feel the procedure). The types of surgery to repair the droopy lid include the following:
Your surgeon makes an opening in the skin of your upper eyelid. This allows the surgeon to find the small muscle that raises your eyelid. The surgeon places stitches to tighten this muscle and raise your eyelid. The incision in the skin of your eyelid is then closed with more stitches.
The surgeon can perform the entire surgery from underneath your eyelid. In this case, your surgeon flips your eyelid and tightens the muscle from underneath. No skin incision is required for this approach.
After surgery, your surgeon will explain how to take care of your eye. It’s important to come back to your provider after surgery so they can check your results. Appointments are usually scheduled for several days to one week after surgery.
Prevention tips
Can ptosis be prevented?
You can’t prevent congenital ptosis since it’s present at birth (your baby is born with it). Most causes of acquired ptosis are difficult to prevent, as well.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have ptosis?
The outlook (prognosis) for ptosis depends on the type and severity of the condition. If you need surgery, the outlook is generally good. Most surgeries to correct drooping eyelids are very successful.
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You should see your eye care specialist if ptosis is affecting your vision. You should also reach out to them if:
The condition affects your appearance and it bothers you.
One eyelid suddenly starts drooping or closing.
You have any double vision or pain.
If your child has ptosis, they should see an eye care specialist right away to assess their condition. Sometimes, their provider may recommend treatment immediately to prevent issues with vision development. Regardless if they receive treatment right away or later on, they should see an ophthalmologist regularly to keep track of their vision through regular eye exams.
Possible complications
Complications can occur after ptosis surgery. Immediately following surgery, your eyelid height and shape may be asymmetrical. Your surgeon may have also under- or overcorrected your condition, which should resolve over time. Other complications of ptosis surgery include:
Bleeding from the wound.
Surgical site infection.
Damage to your cornea.
Incomplete or abnormal closure of your eyelids.
Recurrent (returning) ptosis.
Eye drops for ptosis
A prescription eye drop medication for adults with some forms of acquired ptosis is available. The medication is called oxymetazoline, and it targets the levator muscle. After using the drops, some people have noticed their eyelid opens wider. To continue working, you must use the drops every day. The drops don’t work for all forms of ptosis, so talk to your ophthalmologist to see if they’ll work for you.

Refractive errors (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, presbyopia, hypermetropia)
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Refractive Errors: These encompasses a catalogue of diseases which affect the eye's ability to focus light correctly. These can be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgery.45. Some of the diseases that can be termed as “Refractive Errors” include: 
What are refractive errors?
A refractive error is something about the natural shape of your eyes that makes your vision blurry. Refractive errors are some of the most common vision problems people experience.
The parts of your eyes work together like a relay team to pass light that enters your eye along a pathway to your brain. Light passes through your cornea — the clear part at the front of your eye. Your cornea focuses that light through your lens into a signal that hits your retina — the layer at the very back of your eyeball. Your retina converts that light into electrical signals that your optic nerve sends to your brain. Your brain then uses those signals to create the images you see.
Depending on which type of refractive error you have, something about the shape of your eyeball, your cornea or your lens prevents your eyes from focusing correctly on objects you’re looking at. This distorts your vision.
There are a few types of refractive errors. Some make it hard to focus your eyes on objects close to you. Others make objects far away look blurry. No matter which type of refractive error you have, an eye care specialist can diagnose and treat it. They’ll check your eyes and vision and prescribe a treatment to help you see clearly again.
Most people with refractive errors develop them over time as they grow and develop. Many refractive errors first appear in kids. But you can develop a refractive error at any point in your life, even if you’ve had clear vision before.
Visit an eye care specialist as soon as you notice your vision changing or getting worse. Even if you already wear corrective lenses like eyeglasses or contact lenses, you need your eyes examined regularly.
What are the types of refractive errors?
The four most common types of refractive errors include:
Myopia (nearsightedness)
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Nearsightedness (myopia)
People who have nearsightedness (myopia) have difficulty seeing distant objects, but can see objects that are close to them clearly. For example, if you have nearsightedness, you might not be able to make out signs on the side of the road until they’re just a few feet away or right outside of your car’s window.
Usually, nearsightedness happens because your eye grows too long from front to back. Sometimes, nearsightedness happens because your cornea or lens is too curved.
Nearsightedness usually develops in kids when they’re around 10 years old.

Hyperopia/hypermetropia (farsightedness)
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Farsightedness (hyperopia)
Farsightedness (hyperopia) makes it hard to see objects close to you clearly. It’s the opposite of myopia. If you have farsightedness, you might be able to read words on a screen on the other side of the room clearly, but will struggle to read notes you’re typing on your laptop that’s right in front of you.
Your eye growing too short from front to back causes farsightedness. Another cause is your cornea or lens being too flat (not being curved enough).
People with farsightedness are usually born with it.

ASTIGMATISM
Alternative names: Astigmatism is also called astigma, stigmatism (an antonym for astigmatism); The term “astigmatism” itself is derived from the Greek words “a-” (without) and “stigma” (point or mark), referring to the inability of the eye to focus light to a single point.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
Astigmatism (uh- STIG-muh-tiz-um) is a common and generally treatable imperfection or an irregular curvature of the cornea or lenses of the eye that causes blurred distance and near vision. 
Astigmatism occurs when either the front surface of the eye (cornea) or the lens inside the eye has mismatched curves. Instead of having one curve like a rounded ball, the surface is egg-shaped. This causes blurred vision at all distances. 
Astigmatism is often present at birth and may occur in combination with nearsightedness or farsightedness. Often, it's not pronounced enough to require corrective action. When it is, treatment options are corrective lenses or surgery.
Astigmatism
Astigmatism can make objects at any distance look blurry. Usually, eyes are round. If you have astigmatism, your eye is shaped like a football or the back of a spoon. This makes light that enters your eyes bend and distort more than it should.
Astigmatism can develop at any point in your life. Some people are born with it. Others don’t experience it until they’re adults.
  
CAUSES
Causes 
The eye has two structures with curved surfaces that bend (refract) light onto the retina, which makes the images: 
The cornea, the clear front surface of the eye along with the tear film 
The lens, a clear structure inside the eye that changes shape to help the eye focus on near objects 
In a perfectly shaped eye, each of these elements has a round curvature, like the surface of a smooth ball. A cornea or lens with such curvature bends (refracts) all incoming light equally to make a sharply focused image directly on the retina at the back of the eye.  
A refractive error 
If either the cornea or the lens is egg-shaped with two mismatched curves, light rays aren't bent the same, which means that two different images form. These two images overlap or combine and result in blurred vision. Astigmatism is a type of refractive error. 
Astigmatism occurs when the cornea or lens is curved more steeply in one direction than in another. You have corneal astigmatism if your cornea has mismatched curves. You have lenticular astigmatism if your lens has mismatched curves. 
Either type of astigmatism can cause blurred vision. Blurred vision may occur more in one direction: horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
Astigmatism may be present from birth, or it may develop after an eye injury, disease or surgery. Astigmatism isn't caused or made worse by reading in poor light, sitting too close to the television or squinting.  
Other refractive errors 
Astigmatism may occur in combination with other refractive errors, which include: 
Nearsightedness (myopia). This occurs when the cornea is curved too much or the eye is longer than usual. Instead of being focused precisely on the retina, light is focused in front of the retina, making distant objects seem blurry. 
Farsightedness (hyperopia). This occurs when the cornea is curved too little or the eye is shorter than usual. The effect is the opposite of nearsightedness. When the eye is in a relaxed state, light never comes to a focus at the back of the eye, making nearby objects seem blurry 

RISK FACTORS
Risk factors for astigmatism include: 
Genetics. Astigmatism can be hereditary, meaning it's passed down from parents. 
Eye injury. 
Keratoconus. Astigmatism risk is higher in people who have keratoconus, an eye condition in which the cornea thins and bulges outward. 
Eye surgery. Astigmatism can happen after eye surgery. 

SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
Signs and symptoms of astigmatism may include: 
Blurred or distorted vision 
Eyestrain or discomfort 
Headaches 
Difficulty with night vision 
Squinting 

DIAGNOSIS METHOD
Astigmatism is diagnosed with an eye exam. A complete eye exam involves both a series of tests to check eye health and a refraction, which determines how the eyes bend light. Your eye doctor may use various instruments, aim bright lights directly at your eyes and ask you to look through several lenses. Your doctor uses these tests to examine different aspects of your eyes and vision and to determine the prescription needed to provide clear vision with eyeglasses or contact lenses.  

TREATMENT OPTIONS 
The goal of treating astigmatism is to improve vision clarity and eye comfort. Treatments are corrective lenses or refractive surgery. 
Corrective lenses 
Wearing corrective lenses treats astigmatism by counteracting uneven curvatures of your cornea or lens. 
Types of corrective lenses include: 
Eyeglasses. Eyeglasses are made with lenses that help compensate for the uneven shape of the eye. The lenses make the light bend into the eye properly. Eyeglasses can also correct for other refractive errors, such as nearsightedness or farsightedness. 
Contact lenses. Like eyeglasses, contact lenses can correct most astigmatism. They are available in a variety of types and styles. 
Wearing contact lenses for extended periods of time increases the risk of infection in the eye. 
Ask your eye doctor about the pros and cons and risks of contact lenses and what might be best for you. 
Refractive surgery 
Refractive surgery improves vision and reduces the need for eyeglasses or contact lenses. An eye surgeon uses a laser beam to reshape the curves of the cornea, which corrects the refractive error. Before surgery, doctors will evaluate you and determine if you're a candidate for refractive surgery. 
Types of refractive surgery for astigmatism include: 
Laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK). With this procedure, an eye surgeon makes a thin, hinged flap in the cornea. He or she uses an excimer laser to sculpt the shape of the cornea and then repositions the flap. 
Laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK). Instead of creating a flap in the cornea, the surgeon loosens the cornea's thin protective cover (epithelium) with a special alcohol. He or she uses an excimer laser to change the curvature of the cornea and then repositions the loosened epithelium. 
Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). This procedure is similar to LASEK, except the surgeon removes the epithelium. It will grow back naturally, conforming to the cornea's new shape. You may need to wear a bandage contact lens for a few days after surgery. 
Epi-LASIK. This is a variation of LASEK. The surgeon uses a special mechanized blunt blade — instead of the alcohol — to separate a very thin sheet of epithelium. He or she then uses an excimer laser to reshape the cornea and repositions the epithelium. 
Small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). This newer type of refractive surgery reshapes the cornea by using a laser to make a lens-shaped bit of tissue (lenticule) below the cornea's surface. The lenticule is then removed through a very small incision. For now, the SMILE procedure is only approved for treating mild nearsightedness. 
Other types of refractive surgeries include clear lens extraction and implantable contact lenses. There is no one best method for refractive surgery, and you should make a decision only after a complete evaluation and thorough discussion with your surgeon. 
Prevention tips
PROGNOSIS 
The prognosis of cases with astigmatism is usually good if treated on time, as there are multiple options available to correct astigmatism. Untreated patients, especially during childhood, may result in a permanent reduction in visual acuity and amblyopia. 
Astigmatism is subject to change with time and will require new glasses and contact lenses. Refractive correction can often eliminate or reduce astigmatism in most cases. Patients with keratoconus can develop loss of visual acuity due to high astigmatism; hence timely and regular screening is mandated.  
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
Some of the possible complications that can occur after refractive surgery include: 
Undercorrection or overcorrection of your initial problem 
Visual side effects, such as a halo or starburst appearing around lights 
Dry eye 
Infection 
Corneal scarring 
Rarely, vision loss 
Defective vision 
Distorted vision 
Amblyopia 
Polyopia 
Strabismus 
Contact lens-induced infective keratitis 
Discuss the potential risks and benefits of these procedures with your eye doctor.

WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR
See an eye doctor if your eye symptoms detract from your enjoyment of activities or interfere with your ability to perform everyday tasks. An eye doctor can determine whether you have astigmatism and, if so, to what degree. He or she can then advise you of your options to correct your vision. 
Children and adolescents 
Children may not realize their vision is blurry, so they need to be screened for eye disease and have their vision tested by a pediatrician, an ophthalmologist, an optometrist or another trained screener at the following ages and intervals. 
During the newborn period 
At well-child visits until they reach school age 
During school years, every 1 to 2 years at well-child visits, at the eye doctor, or through school or public screenings

Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
Astigmatism typically changes with age. In early childhood, from 0 to 4 years of age, the cornea is steep, there is a high degree of corneal astigmatism, and the most common axis is against the rule of astigmatism. In the age group aged 4 to 18 years, the cornea flattens, astigmatism reduces, and small degrees of with the rule astigmatism is common. From 18 to 40 years, the cornea remains stable, and a small degree of astigmatism is common. From 40 years onwards, the cornea again steepens, and there is a shift in corneal astigmatism toward the rule. 
Further, astigmatism varies amongst different ethnic groups. An increased prevalence of the rule astigmatism has been noted among Native Americans. Harvey, Dobson, and Miller reported astigmatism of 1.00D or more among 42% of school children. Poor nutrition has been postulated as a cause of reduced corneal rigidity. 
As a result of this, the pressure from the upper eyelid steepens the vertical cornea and flattens the horizontal cornea. Increased rates of change in astigmatism have been reported among Asian subjects. The tightness of the Asian eyelids and narrow palpebral fissures have been suggested as causes of the greater rates of astigmatism change. Kleisnstein et al. reported the prevalence of one or more diopters among 33.6% of Asian and 36.9% of Hispanic children. 
A study from Brazil reported the prevalence of myopia to be 2.7%, with a high prevalence of astigmatism of 16% (1 D astigmatism). They found a predominance of against the rule of astigmatism. In another study by Fuller et al., a high incidence of WTR astigmatism was seen in a small population subgroup of Bangladeshi children residing in East London.

Definition and description
Age-related farsightedness (presbyopia)
Age-related farsightedness (presbyopia) is a specific type of farsightedness that develops as you get older. Just like the farsightedness that can affect anyone, presbyopia makes it hard to see things up close. It’s usually the reason people need reading glasses as they age.
Presbyopia develops when the lens of your eye becomes less flexible and can’t focus on objects as well as it used to. It usually develops in people older than 40.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of a refractive error?
All refractive errors will make your vision worse. In addition to having trouble seeing clearly, your symptoms might include:
Blurry vision either up close, at a distance or both.
Double vision (diplopia).
Headaches.
Squinting.
Eye strain.
Eye pain.
Sometimes, kids might not know their vision is getting worse. If you notice your child has a hard time concentrating or if their grades in school suddenly get worse, they might have a refractive error. Visit your pediatrician or eye care specialist if you notice any changes in your child’s eyes, vision or behavior.
What causes refractive errors?
Changes in the shape of your cornea, your lens or your whole eye can cause refractive errors. Which type of refractive error you have depends on how your eye is shaped.
They can also develop as you get older. Aging eyes can develop a refractive error you didn’t have when you were younger.
Some people develop a refractive error after surgery to remove cataracts from their eyes.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are refractive errors diagnosed?
An eye care specialist will diagnose refractive errors with an eye exam. They’ll look at your eyes (including inside them). They’ll also have you perform a visual acuity test. This will help determine which type of refractive error you have and how much it’s affecting your vision.
Management and Treatment
How are refractive errors treated?
Treatments for refractive errors include:
Eyeglasses.
Contact lenses.
Vision correction surgery such as LASIK and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).
Usually, your eye care specialist will prescribe you glasses or contacts before you have vision correction surgery. However, you might be a good candidate for vision correction surgery right away. Talk to your eye care specialist about which treatment will work the best for you.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of developing a refractive error?
There’s usually nothing you can do to prevent a refractive error from developing in your eyes. Because they’re caused by the shape of your eye, cornea or lens — or changes to these parts of your eyes — there’s no way to prevent refractive errors. There’s also nothing you can do to prevent your child from being born with a refractive error.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a refractive error?
Having a refractive error might require you to wear glasses or contacts — or need vision correction surgery — but it shouldn’t impact your health.
The prescription (or strength) of your corrective lenses might change over time. Some people who receive vision correction surgery experience regression — the effects of the surgery disappearing over time.
If you have a refractive error, you have an increased risk of developing other conditions that affect your eyes, including:
Glaucoma.
Lazy eye (amblyopia).
Crossed eyes (strabismus).

When should I have my eyes examined?
Having your eyes and vision checked regularly can help your eye care specialist identify problems right away. How often you should get your eyes checked usually depends on your age:
Kids: Your child’s pediatrician should check their eyes around the time they learn the alphabet, and then every one to two years.
Adults younger than 40: Every five to 10 years.
Adults between 40 and 54: Every two to four years.
Adults older than 55: Every one to three years.
You might need your eyes checked more often than this if you wear glasses, contacts or need another type of visual aid. People with diabetes need their eyes checked more often than what’s listed here.
Ask your eye care specialist how often you need an eye exam.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
See your healthcare provider or eye care specialist as soon as you notice any changes in your eyes or vision.
Go to the emergency room if you have any of the following symptoms:
A sudden loss of vision.
Severe eye pain.
You see new flashes or floaters in your eyes.

Retinal detachment
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Retinal Detachment: Separation of the retina from its underlying tissue, a serious condition that can cause permanent vision loss if not treated promptly.
happens when the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye pulls away from its regular position. This layer of tissue is called the retina. Retinal detachment is an emergency. 

Retinal detachment separates the retinal cells from the layer of blood vessels that provides oxygen and nourishment to the eye. The longer retinal detachment goes without treatment, the greater the risk of permanent vision loss in the affected eye. 
Symptoms of retinal detachment can include the following: reduced vision, the sudden appearance of dark floating shapes and flashes of light in your vision, and loss of side vision. Contacting an eye doctor, called an ophthalmologist, right away can help save your vision.  
Causes 
Causes 
There are three main types of retinal detachment, and their causes vary: 
Rhegmatogenous (reg-mu-TOJ-uh-nus). This type of retinal detachment is the most common. A rhegmatogenous detachment is caused by a hole or tear in the retina that lets fluid pass through and collect underneath the retina. This fluid builds up and causes the retina to pull away from underlying tissues. The areas where the retina detaches lose their blood supply and stop working. This causes you to lose vision. 
The most common cause of rhegmatogenous detachment is aging. As you age, gel-like material that fills the inside of your eye, called vitreous (VIT-ree-us), may change in texture and shrink or become more liquid. Usually, the vitreous separates from the surface of the retina without any complications. This is a common condition called a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). 
As the vitreous separates or peels off the retina, it may tug on the retina with enough force to create a tear. Most of the time it doesn't. But if a PVD causes a tear and the tear isn't treated, the liquid vitreous can pass through the tear into the space behind the retina. This causes the retina to detach. 
Tractional. This type of detachment can happen when scar tissue grows on the retina's surface. The scar tissue causes the retina to pull away from the back of the eye. Tractional detachment usually is seen in people who have poorly controlled diabetes. 
Exudative. In this type of detachment, fluid builds up beneath the retina, but there are no holes or tears in the retina. Exudative detachment can be caused by age-related macular degeneration, infection, tumors or inflammatory conditions. 
Risk factors 
The following factors raise your risk of retinal detachment: 
Aging — retinal detachment is more common in people ages 40 to 70. 
Past retinal detachment in one eye. 
Family history of retinal detachment. 
Extreme nearsightedness, also called myopia. 
Past eye surgery, such as cataract removal. 
Past severe eye injury. 
History of other eye diseases or conditions, including retinoschisis, uveitis or thinning of the peripheral retina called lattice degeneration. 
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms 
Retinal detachment is painless. Often, symptoms are present before a retinal detachment happens or before it has gotten worse. You may notice symptoms such as: 
The sudden appearance of tiny specks or squiggly lines that seem to drift through your field of vision. These are called floaters. 
Flashes of light in one or both eyes. These are called photopsias. 
Blurred vision. 
Side vision, also called peripheral vision, becomes worse. 
A curtain like a shadow over your field of vision. 

Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Diagnosis 
Diagnosis involves the steps that your healthcare professional takes to find out if retinal detachment is the cause of your symptoms. Your healthcare team may use the following tests and instruments to diagnose retinal detachment: 
Retinal exam. Your healthcare professional may use an instrument with a bright light and special lenses to check the back of your eye, including the retina. This type of device provides a detailed view of your whole eye. It lets your healthcare professional see any retinal holes, tears or detachments. 
Ultrasound imaging. Your healthcare professional may use this test if bleeding has happened in your eye. Bleeding makes it hard to see the retina. 
Your healthcare professional likely will check both eyes even if you have symptoms in just one. If a retinal tear is not found at this visit, your healthcare professional may ask you to return within a few weeks. The return visit is done to confirm that your eye has not developed a delayed retinal tear due to the same vitreous detachment. Also, if you have new symptoms, it's important to return to your healthcare professional right away.  
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Treatment 
Surgery is almost always the type of treatment used to repair a retinal tear, hole or detachment. Various techniques are available. Ask your ophthalmologist about the risks and benefits of your treatment options. Together you can decide what treatment or combination of treatments is best for you. 
Retinal tears 
When the retina has a tear or hole but hasn't yet become detached, your eye surgeon may suggest one of the following treatments. These treatments can help prevent retinal detachment and preserve vision. 
Laser surgery, also called laser photocoagulation or retinopexy. The surgeon directs a laser beam into the eye through the pupil. The laser makes burns around the retinal tear to create scarring that usually "welds" the retina to underlying tissue. 
Freezing, also called cryopexy. Before treatment starts, you're given medicine to numb your eye. Then the surgeon applies a freezing probe to the outer surface of the eye directly over the tear. The freezing causes a scar that helps secure the retina to the eye wall. 
Both treatments can be done in the eye doctor's office. Most often, you can go home afterward. You'll likely be told not to do activities that might jar the eyes — such as running — for a couple of weeks or so.  
If your retina has detached, you'll need surgery to repair it. It's ideal to get surgery within days of finding out that your retina has detached. The type of surgery that your surgeon recommends depends on factors such as the location of the retinal detachment and how severe it is. 
Injecting air or gas into the eye. This surgery is called pneumatic retinopexy (RET-ih-no-pek-see). A surgeon injects a bubble of air or gas into the center part of the eye, also called the vitreous cavity. When positioned properly, the bubble pushes the area of the retina that contains the hole or holes against the wall of the eye. This stops the flow of fluid into the space behind the retina. The surgeon also uses cryopexy or laser photocoagulation during the treatment to create scarring around the retinal break. 
Fluid that had collected underneath the retina is absorbed by itself, and the retina can then stick to the wall of the eye. You may need to hold your head in a certain position for up to a week to keep the bubble in the proper position. The bubble goes away on its own in time. 
Indenting the surface of the eye. This surgery is called scleral (SKLAIR-ul) buckling. It involves the surgeon sewing a piece of silicone to the white part of the eye, called the sclera, over the affected area. This surgery indents the wall of the eye and relieves some of the force caused by the vitreous tugging on the retina. The silicone is placed in a way that doesn't block your vision, and it usually remains in place for life. During surgery, cryoretinopexy or laser photocoagulation may be done to help seal tears in the retina. If fluid has collected below the retina, the surgeon may drain it. 
Draining and replacing the fluid in the eye. This surgery is known as vitrectomy (vih-TREK-tuh-me). The surgeon removes the vitreous along with any tissue that is tugging on the retina. Air, gas or silicone oil is then injected into the vitreous space to help flatten the retina. During surgery, tears in the retina can be sealed with cryoretinopexy or laser photocoagulation. There may be fluid below the retina that needs to be drained. 
The air or gas that is injected into the vitreous space is absorbed in time. The vitreous space refills with fluid. If silicone oil was used, it may be removed with surgery months later. 
Vitrectomy may be combined with scleral buckling. 
After surgery, your vision may take months to get better. You may need a second surgery for successful treatment. Some people never get back all of their lost vision.  
Prevention tips
Prevention 
You can’t prevent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, but you can take steps to lower your risk: 
Get regular eye care: Eye exams protect your eye health. If you have nearsightedness, eye exams are especially important. Myopia makes you more prone to retinal detachment. Your eye care provider should include dilated exams to find small retinal tears. 
Stay safe: Use safety goggles or other protection for your eyes when playing sports or doing other risky activities. 
Get prompt treatment: If you notice detached retina symptoms, see your eye care provider right away or go to the emergency room. 
Maintain your overall health: Manage chronic conditions, eat balanced meals and get regular exercise. 
You can help to prevent diabetes-related tractional retinal detachment by improving your blood glucose levels and blood pressure. 
How often should I get regular eye exams? 
People who have an average risk of eye disease should get eye exams once a year. If you’re at higher risk for eye disease, you may need checkups more frequently. Talk to your provider to figure out your best exam schedule. 
Prognosis
Outlook / Prognosis 
What can I expect if I have a retinal detachment? 
Your outlook depends on factors like how clear your vision was before the retinal detachment, how extensive your detachment was and if there are any other complicating factors. Your provider will talk to you about what type of vision improvement you can expect. 
In general, surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is highly successful — the repair works about nine out of 10 times. Sometimes, people need more than one procedure to return the retina to its place. 
Can I get a detached retina again? 
It’s possible to get a detached retina more than once. You may need a second surgery if this happens. Talk to your provider about preventive steps you can take to protect your vision. 
Living With 
How do I take care of myself? 
It’s essential that you follow the instructions you get from your eye care provider about positioning and about your activities. 
Ask your provider for suggestions on how to make things easier, like using a firm neck pillow to help keep your head in place. If you must lie face down or stay in that position for most of your time, your provider’s office can help you get face-down equipment for your home. 
Possible complications
When to see a doctor / red flag
When to see a doctor 
See a healthcare professional right away if you have any symptoms of retinal detachment. This condition is an emergency that can cause lasting vision loss. 
Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 
The differential diagnoses for suspected retinal detachment include the following: 
Retinoschisis  
Choroidal effusion or serous choroidal detachment 
Choroidal mass 
Suprachoroidal hemorrhage (hemorrhagic choroidal detachment) 
The clinician can differentiate the above with a dilated fundoscopic exam and appropriate imaging techniques. If the patient has a quadrantanopia or hemianopia in both eyes, a cerebrovascular event should be in the differential. RRD should be on the differential for patients who have a TRD.Massive subretinal hemorrhage from various causes, including choroidal neovascular membrane due to age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy (PEHCR), blood dyscrasias, anticoagulants, and trauma cause hemorrhagic RD. 
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
The incidence and risk of RRD vary between study results; one showed 1 in 10,000 individuals, and another showed the annual risk of RRD to be about 6.3 to 17.9 per 100,000 individuals. Males may be at a slightly higher risk than females of getting an RRD. There may be a higher risk of RRD in those of Southeastern Asian descent compared to European White race persons, confounded by the fact that Southeastern Asian populations tended to have a higher risk of myopia and a longer axial length. Results from another study did not find a significant difference in risk factors, postoperative outcomes, and clinical features in patients with retinal detachments between Indian, Malay, and Chinese populations in Singapore

RETINOPATHY OF PRREMATURITY
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
What is retinopathy of prematurity?
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an eye condition that affects some infants who are born early (premature birth), particularly before 31 weeks. With ROP, abnormal blood vessels form in a baby’s retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of your eye that converts light to electrical signals, which travel to your brain. Your brain processes these signals and creates the images that make up your vision.
The abnormal blood vessels that form in ROP usually cause no harm and require no special treatment other than monitoring. Up to 90% of babies with ROP get better without treatment and have normal vision. However, the condition can sometimes get worse and threaten a baby’s vision. In these cases, timely treatment is necessary to prevent permanent retinal damage and vision loss. Without treatment, advanced ROP can lead to blindness.
That’s why healthcare providers recommend screenings for at-risk babies soon after birth. These screenings check for signs of ROP and identify when a baby needs treatment. Your baby’s healthcare provider will tell you if your baby is at risk for ROP. They’ll also tell you when your baby needs screenings. It’s essential to follow the screening schedule they give you to lower your baby’s risk of serious vision problems.
How common is retinopathy of prematurity?
In the U.S., about 14,000 to 16,000 infants develop ROP each year. About 90% of these babies have a mild form of ROP that doesn’t need treatment. About 1,100 to 1,500 have a severe form that needs treatment. ROP causes legal blindness in 400 to 600 infants per year.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the signs and symptoms of retinopathy of prematurity?
There are usually no obvious signs or symptoms that you can notice in your baby. An ophthalmologist needs to closely examine your baby’s eyes (including blood vessel formation in their retinas) to see if they have ROP.
What causes retinopathy of prematurity?
Disruption to the normal process of blood vessel formation in your baby’s retinas causes ROP.
Your baby needs healthy retinas with normal blood supply to see the world around them. Retinal blood vessels develop throughout pregnancy but aren’t completely formed until close to birth. As a result, babies born prematurely don’t have fully formed blood vessels in their retinas. Those vessels continue to form after birth, but they may develop abnormally.
It’s not always possible to tell which babies will have ROP, but researchers know some factors raise a baby’s risk.
Risk factors for retinopathy of prematurity
Risk factors for ROP include:
Preterm delivery before 31 weeks. The earlier the delivery, the higher the risk of ROP.
Birth weight of 1,500 grams (about 3.3 pounds) or less.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain).
Infections or other medical problems.
If your baby has one or more risk factors, their healthcare provider will recommend a screening soon after birth to check your baby’s eyes for signs of ROP.
What are the complications of this condition?
Untreated, severe cases of retinopathy of prematurity can lead to retinal detachment. This means your baby’s retina pulls away from the supportive tissues around it. Retinal detachment can cause severe vision loss or blindness.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is retinopathy of prematurity diagnosed?
Neonatologists typically identify babies who are at risk for ROP. They refer these babies to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. During this exam (also called a “screening”), an ophthalmologist uses eye drops to dilate your baby’s eyes and look for signs of ROP. They may take digital pictures of your baby’s retinas. This initial screening usually takes place four to six weeks after birth.
Different countries have different guidelines for which babies should be screened for ROP. In the U.S., infants are typically screened if they:
Have a gestational age of 30 weeks or less.
Have a birth weight of 1,500 grams (3.3 pounds) or less.
Have a higher gestational age or birth weight but have other risk factors for ROP.
Your baby may need additional screenings every one to three weeks, or according to the timeline their provider gives you. Your baby’s ophthalmologist will tell you when they no longer need these exams. This is usually when the blood vessels in your baby’s retinas are fully formed and there’s no risk of retinal detachment.
If the ophthalmologist diagnoses your baby with ROP, they’ll use a staging system to identify the condition’s severity.
Retinopathy of prematurity stages
Ophthalmologists assign a stage to each case of ROP to help describe its severity and the need for treatment. These stages range from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe:
Stages 1 and 2: Mild to moderate ROP that usually goes away without treatment.
Stage 3: ROP that may need treatment to prevent retinal damage or detachment.
Stage 4: Severe ROP that leads to partial retinal detachment and requires urgent treatment.
Stage 5: Severe ROP that leads to total retinal detachment and requires urgent treatment. Vision loss or blindness may still result despite treatment.
Other terms you may hear include:
Aggressive retinopathy of prematurity: A severe case of ROP that quickly gets worse.
Plus disease: Severe ROP that includes the presence of widened (dilated) and wavy (tortuous) blood vessels in the retina.
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for retinopathy of prematurity?
Treatment options for retinopathy of prematurity include:
Laser therapy. This treatment creates a pattern of small burns on the outer edges of your baby’s retina. These burns prevent abnormal blood vessels from forming. Laser therapy successfully treats ROP about 90% of the time.
Anti-VEGF therapy. This treatment involves injections (shots) into your baby’s eye to deliver medication that stops abnormal blood vessel growth.
Your baby’s ophthalmologist will tell you the pros and cons of these treatments and explain the most suitable treatment plan for your baby.
If your baby has a retinal detachment (stage 4 or 5 ROP), they’ll need further treatment, typically with a retina specialist. For example, the retinal specialist may recommend a surgery called a vitrectomy.
When do you treat retinopathy of prematurity?
Your baby needs treatment if they’re at risk for retinal detachment, or if retinal detachment has already occurred. Your baby’s ophthalmologist will determine the best timing for treatment based on the ROP stage and findings from screenings.
Prevention
Can you prevent retinopathy of prematurity?
ROP happens due to premature birth. Therefore, any steps you can take to lower your risk of early delivery can help lower your baby’s chances of developing ROP. It’s important to seek medical care during pregnancy and follow your provider’s guidance.
It’s also important to remember that sometimes, premature birth can’t be avoided, even if you follow all available advice. If this happens, don’t blame yourself. Advances in treatments and technology help babies born prematurely to be healthy and have a good prognosis.
Outlook / Prognosis
Does retinopathy of prematurity go away?
ROP often goes away on its own without permanent damage to your baby’s retina or vision. However, severe cases of ROP need treatment to prevent complications like retinal detachment and vision loss.
Talk to your baby’s ophthalmologist to learn what treatment they may need and how ROP may affect their vision in the future.
Living With
How do I take care of my baby?
The most important thing you can do is take your baby to all of the screening appointments that their ophthalmologist recommends. These screenings are vital for diagnosing and treating ROP quickly enough to lower the risk for permanent vision loss.
Babies who receive treatment for ROP need lifelong follow-up visits. These are especially important during early childhood. Your baby’s ophthalmologist will look for signs of abnormal blood vessel formation. This can happen despite successful treatment years prior.
Babies born prematurely who don’t have ROP also need regular eye exams. That’s because they face an increased risk of certain eye problems, including:
Amblyopia (lazy eye).
Strabismus (crossed eyes).
Glaucoma.
Ask your baby’s ophthalmologist how often they should have eye exams, and stick to this schedule.
What questions should I ask my baby’s healthcare provider?
Questions you can ask your baby’s ophthalmologist to learn more about retinopathy of prematurity include:
Is my baby at risk for retinopathy of prematurity?
How often does my baby need screenings for ROP?
When might my baby need treatment?
What is the best treatment option?
What are the benefits and risks of treatment?
What follow-up visits will my baby need after treatment?
What is my baby’s outlook?

epidemiology
Many important epidemiological risk factors for ROP were established in the Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity study. This randomized, prospective multicenter trial compared the safety of earlier vs. conventionally timed ablation of peripheral retina.[2] The incidence of any stage of ROP was 68% among infants weighing less than 1251g. In the year 2010, a global number of 184,700 infants and 14.9 million preterm infants developed any stage ROP.[3] Of those afflicted, 20,000 became blind or severely visually impaired, and 12,300 developed mild to moderate visual impairment.
The two strongest known risk factors for ROP are gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW). A multicenter study of over 4000 infants with birthweight ≤1251g found that for each 100g increase in BW, odds of developing threshold ROP decreased by 27%, and for each extra week in GA, the odds of developing threshold ROP decreased by 19%.[9]
Another important risk factor is oxygen. As mentioned above, the use of supplemental oxygen in combination with atmospheric oxygen results in the reversal of physiologic hypoxia, which then contributes to retinal ischemia and subsequent overgrowth of retinal vessels in ROP.  Additionally, the concentration of oxygen delivered is an independent risk factor for ROP, whereby increased concentrations of O2 increase the risk of ROP.[10] For every 12 hour period with transcutaneous PO2≥80mmHg, the risk of ROP doubles.[7] Duration of oxygen therapy is a significant risk factor for severe ROP.[11] Possible risk factors include hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, maternal diabetes, medication use, age, smoking, assisted conception, birth outside of a study center hospital, and multiple gestations.[12]

Retinopathy of Prematurity: Causes & Treatment Options
RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) is also known as an “eye stroke”. It is sometimes known as “Rious Retinal Vascular Occlusions”
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a partial or total blockage in a vein that drains blood from your retina. Your retina is a layer of tissue at the back of your eye that helps translate light into images you can see. A blockage in a retinal vein prevents blood from leaving your retina. This can lead to complications, including raised pressure in your eye and swelling. These issues need prompt treatment to prevent or minimize vision loss. 
There’s no current safe way to unblock the vein. However, treatment can manage complications and protect your vision. 
Eye care specialists tailor treatment to your individual needs. You may need multiple treatments ranging from injections to surgery to manage your condition. 
Types of retinal vein occlusion 
There are two types of RVO: 
Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), or blockage of the main retinal vein. 
Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), or blockage of one of the smaller branch veins. This type is more common. 

How common is retinal vein occlusion? 

Retinal vein occlusion is the second most common disorder affecting your retina (diabetes-related retinopathy is the most common). 
Researchers estimate that globally: 
Retinal vein occlusion affects over 16 million people. 
Central retinal vein occlusion affects between 1 and 4 in 1,000 people. 
Branch retinal vein occlusion affects between 6 and 12 in 1,000 people. 
 

CAUSES
What causes retinal vein occlusion? 
A disruption to normal blood flow through your retinal vein causes this condition. The disruption may happen due to: 
A blood clot. 
A slowdown of blood flow. 
Compression of your retinal vein at the point where it crosses paths with your retinal artery. Your retinal artery supplies oxygen-rich blood to your retina. Your retinal artery may grow stiff from aging or plaque buildup, and it may press on your retinal vein. This can damage the inner lining of your retinal vein, creating conditions where a blood clot is more likely to form. 

RISK FACTORS
What are the risk factors for retinal vein occlusion? 
Being over age 40 is a major risk factor. RVO usually affects people in their 50s or 60s. However, this condition can also affect people younger than age 40. Having certain medical conditions can also raise your risk. These include: 
Atherosclerosis. 
Diabetes. 
Glaucoma. 
High blood pressure. 
Prior history of retinal vein occlusion in one eye raises your risk of developing the condition in your other eye. 
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
Symptoms of retinal vein occlusion typically affect one eye and include: 
Blurry vision or vision loss: This may start suddenly or develop gradually over a period of hours or days. 
Floaters: These are dark spots or lines in your field of vision. 
Pain or pressure in your eye: This is typically in more severe cases. 
You may not have any symptoms until complications arise. Some people don’t realize there’s a problem until their provider finds the issue during a routine eye exam. 
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
How is retinal vein occlusion diagnosed? 
Eye care specialists diagnose RVO through an eye exam and retinal imaging tests. They also coordinate care with your primary care physician (PCP) to discover the cause of blood flow problems. 
Eye exam 
Your eye care specialist will dilate your pupils so they can see into the back of each eye. They’ll use a microscope and a head-mounted ophthalmoscope to shine a light into your eye. They’ll closely examine the inside of your eye to look for complications and signs of vision loss. 
This exam can help: 
Distinguish between central and branch RVO. 
Identify signs of macular edema and abnormal blood vessel formation. 
Estimate how much of your retina lacks blood flow. 
You may need further testing to diagnose RVO and show the extent of complications. 
 
Tests to diagnose retinal vein occlusion 
Your eye care specialist may use one or more of the following tests to help diagnose and describe your condition: 
Fundus photography: This form of retinal imaging shows the presence of abnormal new blood vessels and the amount of bleeding inside your eye. 
Optical coherence tomography (OCT): This form of high-resolution imaging shows the presence of macular edema. It measures the thickness of your retina and provides precise numbers that help guide the treatment of your condition over time. 
Fluorescein angiography: For this test, your provider injects dye into a vein in your arm. The dye travels to the blood vessels in your retina and makes them stand out in imaging. Your provider may use this form of imaging to show the extent of a blockage in your retinal vein. This test also shows how much of your retina isn’t receiving adequate blood flow. 
Coordinated care 
Your eye care specialist and primary care physician will work together to find the cause of RVO and lower your risk for future issues. You may need blood tests to check your cholesterol levels, blood sugar and other important numbers. 
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment 
What are the treatments for retinal vein occlusion? 
There’s currently no way to reverse or cure the blockage in your retinal vein. But eye care specialists can prevent or treat the complications of retinal vein occlusion with: 
Anti-VEGF injections. 
Steroid injections. 
Pan retinal photocoagulation (PRP). 
Vitrectomy surgery. 
Medications to manage risk factors. 
The goals of treatment are to: 
Improve your vision or prevent it from getting worse. 
Identify and treat complications that can harm your vision and eye health. 
Manage risk factors to prevent future problems. 
Your provider will combine treatment options as necessary and explain the timing for each. 
Anti-VEGF injections 
This is a first line (first choice) treatment for people with macular edema. VEGF stands for vascular endothelial growth factor. This is a protein that spurs new blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Too much VEGF can lead to the formation of abnormal blood vessels that can leak and cause swelling. 
Anti-VEGF injections interrupt the production of VEGF in your eye to reduce swelling. Your provider gives you eye drops to numb your eye and reduce pain before injecting the medication into the gel-like substance (vitreous humor) that fills your eyeball. You may need injections at regular intervals for one to two years depending on your condition. 
Specific medications you may receive in these injections include: 
Aflibercept. 
Bevacizumab. 
Ranibizumab. 
Steroid injections 
Injections of steroid medication into your eye can also help reduce swelling. However, in some people, steroid injections cause elevated eye pressure and cataracts. So, they’re often a second-line treatment when anti-VEGF injections aren’t adequate. 
Pan retinal photocoagulation (PRP) 
This laser surgery creates small burns in areas of your retina that lack blood flow. Doing so decreases the number of proteins (VEGF) that promote the formation of abnormal blood vessels. Reducing VEGF helps prevent neovascularization and related bleeding in your eye. It also helps keep your intraocular pressure stable. 
Vitrectomy surgery 
Posterior pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) is a surgery that helps people with retinal vein occlusion who have: 
Severe bleeding in their eye (vitreous hemorrhage). 
Bleeding that lasts more than four weeks. 
Bleeding that keeps coming back. 
Retinal detachment. 
Surgery removes vitreous humor from your eye and repairs damage to your retina. 
Medications to manage risk factors 
Many people with retinal vein occlusion have underlying conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol. These conditions can raise your risk of blood vessel problems. Your eye care specialist will work together with your primary care physician (PCP) to tailor treatment to your needs. Your PCP may prescribe medications to: 
Lower your blood pressure. 
Manage your cholesterol levels. 
Address other issues. 
Prevention tips
Prevention 
Learning you’re at risk for retinal vein occlusion is the first step toward preventing it. Talk to your ophthalmologist or optometrist about your level of risk and how to lower it. 
It’s also important to talk to your primary care physician about underlying conditions that raise your risk for blood flow problems. They’ll recommend treatments as needed to manage those conditions and help keep your eyes — and whole body — healthy. 
Specific things you can do to lower your risk include: 
Follow a diet that supports your heart and blood vessel health. 
Make exercise part of your daily routine. 
Keep a weight that’s healthy for you. 
Avoid smoking and all tobacco products. 
Prognosis
Outlook / Prognosis 
What can I expect if I have this condition? 
Your prognosis depends on many factors, including the location of the blockage and complications that arise. Some people have permanent vision damage, while others have vision that gradually gets better over time. Your eye care specialist is the best person to tell you exactly what you can expect in your individual situation. 
Your provider may refer you to vision rehabilitation. This is a form of rehab that teaches you techniques for living with reduced vision. These may include using devices like magnifying glasses or assistive-computer technology. Your provider may also refer you to a social worker who can help you cope with lifestyle changes. 
Living With 
How do I take care of myself? 
Living with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) can be stressful because you may need: 
Multiple eye injections 
Multiple laser treatments. 
Many follow-up appointments. 
Help getting to and from your appointments (if your condition or treatment prevents you from driving safely). 
All of this may take a toll and feel overwhelming to you. Remember that your healthcare team is there to help you. 
Talk to your providers about how you’re feeling. They may suggest resources to help you learn more about your condition and why all of this effort is so important. They may also connect you with support groups or other community resources where you can talk to people who are in a similar situation. Learning from others’ experiences and sharing your own can help make everything feel more manageable. 
When should I seek medical care? 
Your eye care specialist will tell you how often you need appointments for monitoring or treatment. Call them if you experience new or changing symptoms or have questions about your treatment plan. 
What questions should I ask my provider? 
You may want to ask your eye care specialist: 
What caused the blockage in my retinal vein? 
What treatments are best for me? 
What are the benefits and risks of each treatment? 
What follow-ups will I need? 
How will this condition affect my vision? 
What is my outlook? 

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
What are the complications of retinal vein occlusion? 
Retinal vein occlusion can lead to complications such as: 
Cystoid macular edema: This is swelling in the center of your retina (macula). It can cause blurry vision or loss of vision. 
Neovascularization of the eye: Abnormal blood vessels can form in different parts of your eye, typically your iris (rubeosis iridis). This happens in about 1 in 4 people with RVO. Abnormal blood vessels less commonly form in your retina. 
Bleeding in your eye (vitreous hemorrhage): This is when blood leaks into your vitreous humor, the gel-like substance that fills your eyeball. It results from the formation of abnormal blood vessels, which are prone to leaking. 
Neovascular glaucoma: Abnormal blood vessels in your eye can cause pain and a dangerous increase in pressure inside your eye. 
Retinal detachment: Abnormal blood vessels in your retina may cause your retina to pull away from the tissues that support it. 
People with RVO have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, compared to people without RVO. This may be due to shared underlying risk factors like high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.

Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 
Important differential diagnosis of BRVO includes diabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy can be discerned from BRVO based on a few key features. Diabetic retinopathy is usually bilateral whereas BRVO is usually unilateral. Although both BRVO and diabetic retinopathy may present with dot blot hemorrhages and microaneurysms, only in diabetic retinopathy will extend across the horizontal raphe. Hypertensive retinopathy is the same; hemorrhages are not confined to a single sector, and the findings are usually bilateral. 
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
Retinal venous occlusion (RVO) is the second most common retinal vascular pathology after diabetic retinopathy. The exact incidence of BRVO is difficult to gauge, given the frequent asymptomatic nature of BRVOs. Nonetheless, the Blue Mountain Eye study found a 10-year cumulative risk of RVO to be 1.6% in the United States while finding no predilection for gender or race. The Beaver Dam Eye Study found a 15-year cumulative risk of BRVO to be 1.8%, three times more than CRVO at 0.5%. Risk factors for developing BRVO include increasing age or age over 70 years old, history of systemic arterial hypertension, history of smoking, or a history of glaucoma. A pooled analysis of population-based studies from the United States found BRVO to have a higher prevalence in Asians and Hispanics compared to Caucasians, although this was not statistically significant. Developing BRVO in one eye increases the risk of BRVO in the fellow eye to 7% to 10%.

Retinitis pigmentosa
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Retinitis Pigmentosa is a genetic retinal degeneration causing night blindness and peripheral vision loss56.
What is retinitis pigmentosa?
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare eye diseases that affect the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of the eye). RP makes cells in the retina break down slowly over time, causing vision loss.
RP is a genetic disease that people are born with. Symptoms usually start in childhood, and most people eventually lose most of their sight.
There’s no cure for RP. But vision aids and rehabilitation (training) programs can help people with RP make the most of their vision.
The retina is a layer at the back of your eye that converts light into electrical signals, allowing your brain to see the world around you. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the term for a group of inherited eye diseases (IRDs) that affect your retina. RP is the most common type of inherited eye disease. Examples of other inherited retinal diseases include:
Cone-rod dystrophy.
Congenital stationary night blindness.
Leber congenital amaurosis.
Usher syndrome.
Your eye is often compared to a non-digital camera. The front of your eye contains a lens (just like a lens of a camera). This lens focuses images on the inside of the back of your eye, the retina (just like film in a camera). If the camera film is damaged, it doesn’t matter how much you focus the camera, the picture is not going to be perfect.
Similarly, a diseased retina will affect your vision even if the front of your eye functions well. This includes people with corrective eyeglasses or contact lenses.
Your retina consists of special nerve cells that react to light. These cells include photoreceptor cells such as rods and cones and retinal pigment epithelium cells. For proper sight, it’s essential that these cells work together harmoniously. The genetic mutations that cause RP and other IRDs prevent these cells from functioning properly.
Since RP is a group of disorders, the visual changes vary among different people. Most people with RP have low vision, and some people go blind. The vision changes usually start in childhood. But, sometimes these changes occur so slowly that you don’t realize it’s happening. Some people have faster vision loss. In some types of RP, vision loss stops at a certain point.
Retinitis pigmentosa generally affects both eyes.
If you are diagnosed with RP or IRD, it’s important to obtain genetic testing that can sometimes determine the exact mutation causing the disease. Genetic testing is done with a specifically trained genetic counselor who can help with the ordering and interpretation of the test. Identifying the mutation is important because it can provide insight into how the disease may progress and how other family members may be affected. It also might qualify you to receive gene therapy or participate in a gene therapy clinical trial.
How common is retinitis pigmentosa?
There are an estimated 1 in 3,500 to 1 in 4,000 people in Europe and the U.S. who have retinitis pigmentosa. Globally, RP affects about 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 4,000 people, or about two million people total. In the U.S., this total is estimated at about 100,000 people.
Causes 
What causes retinitis pigmentosa?
Retinitis pigmentosa, as other IRDs, is caused by changes in certain genes. These genes control the cells that make up your retina.
and risk factor
Signs and symptoms
What are the signs and symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa?
Early signs and symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa include:
Problems with night vision.
Problems seeing in dim light.
Blind spots in peripheral (side) vision.
Later retinitis pigmentosa signs and symptoms may include:
Having a sensation of twinkling or flashing light.
Having tunnel vision (only central vision).
Being sensitive to or uncomfortable in bright light (photophobia).
Losing the ability to see color.
Having very low vision.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
What tests will be done to diagnose retinitis pigmentosa?
It’s important to schedule and keep regular eye examinations. If your healthcare provider thinks you may have retinitis pigmentosa, they will use some or all of the following tests to make their diagnosis. They may also suggest genetic testing and/or counseling.
Dilated eye examination with visual field test
You may get your eyes examined by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. Your provider will:
Ask you to read letters off a chart on the wall.
Ask you to follow objects with your eyes.
Test the pressure in your eyes.
Check your side vision (peripheral vision) with a visual field test.
Check how your pupils react to light.
Dilate your pupils with eye drops so they can see inside your eye.
Take images of the retina.
Electroretinography (ERG) test
Electroretinography is a test that measures your retina’s response to light. It checks the function of different retinal cells. Your healthcare provider will flash lights in front of your eyes to measure your retina’s activity. Electroretinography is a type of ophthalmic electrophysiology test. These types of tests can check how your eyes and brain process what you’re seeing by measuring the electrical activity in your retinas, optic nerves, and visual pathways in your brain.
Optical coherence tomography scan
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive test that can measure the thickness of your retina and analyze the retinal integrity. You are asked to look at a target as a special camera takes an image of the back of your eye.
Fundus autofluorescence test
This type of imaging test is noninvasive and can reveal information about the health of your retinas. It’s used for diagnosis, treatment and monitoring.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
How is retinitis pigmentosa managed?
A lot of advances have been made in recent years in the field of RP and IRDs including the introduction of gene therapy.
The ways to manage RP include:
Using low vision aids and assistive devices. There are a range of magnifiers and technology that can identify things or people that the wearer points to.
Using sunglasses and other methods to avoid exposure to too much light. Light may make RP worse.
Treating associated conditions, such as cystoid macular edema (CME), which may happen with RP. CME refers to collections of fluid in the middle of your retina.
Treating cataracts, which happens when the lens of your eyes becomes cloudy, with surgery to remove them.
Are there other ways to treat retinitis pigmentosa?
The FDA has approved voretigene neparvovec-ryzl (Luxturna®), a gene therapy product to treat a specific type of retinitis pigmentosa. People with mutations in both copies of the RP65 gene may benefit from this type of therapy. This particular type of RP affects 1,000 to 2,000 people in the U.S.
There are ongoing clinical trials for gene therapy for the other types of RP and IRDs.
Some people with severe RP may be able to get an artificial retina, also called a retinal prosthesis.
Prevention
How can I prevent retinitis pigmentosa?
Because most forms of retinitis pigmentosa are inherited, you can’t prevent RP. You can, however, take steps to keep your eyes as healthy as possible by:
Making and keeping regular appointments with your ophthalmologist.
Wearing sunglasses and avoiding bright lights.
Being as healthy as possible by eating right and exercising safely.

Prognosis
The prognosis for patients with retinitis pigmentosa depends on the age of onset and pattern of inheritance. Expect early-onset symptoms, severe vision loss, and night blindness with the autosomal recessive form of RP. The autosomal dominant expression is the least severe and is associated with the more gradual onset of symptoms later in adulthood. The most severe vision loss occurs with X-linked recessive RP.[87] Tunnel vision is expected late in all forms of RP, and almost all patients with RP will be legally blind at some point in the progression of their disease. Fortunately, total vision loss is uncommon, as the macular function will generally allow light perception, even after acuity is lost. Many patients retain good central vision into their 40s or 50s.[88] Genetic testing is now available to determine the specific gene mutation causing a patient's RP, which may help predict disease severity and progression.[89]

Complications
Functional difficulties associated with RP include night blindness, progressive loss of vision, and a gradual reduction in peripheral and central vision. In advanced stages, patients with RP may become legally blind or have minimal vision. Severely impaired night vision may make navigating in low-light conditions challenging. RP typically leads to gradually losing peripheral vision (tunnel vision). This narrowing of the visual field can affect daily activities such as mobility and driving.
In some cases, RP can progress to affect central vision, which is essential for tasks like reading and recognizing faces. Some individuals with RP may experience color vision abnormalities, including difficulty distinguishing between specific colors or a reduced ability to perceive colors accurately. Increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) can complicate RP.[90] Bright lights can cause discomfort and glare, making it difficult to tolerate well-lit environments. RP can reduce contrast sensitivity, making distinguishing objects or text from their background difficult. Reduced peripheral vision and contrast sensitivity can lead to difficulties with depth perception, making it harder to judge distances accurately. Reduced vision, especially in low-light conditions, can increase the risk of accidents and injuries, both indoors and outdoors. Individuals with RP may have depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life.[91] As vision deteriorates, individuals with RP may become increasingly dependent on others for daily tasks and mobility, impacting their independence. Due to vision-related limitations, children and adults with RP may face difficulties in educational and occupational settings. 
Ocular complications associated with RP include cataracts, especially posterior subcapsular cataracts. The lens may have weak zonules resulting in anterior capsular phimosis, subluxation, or dislocation of capsular bag-intraocular lens complex after cataract surgery.[92] Patients with RP may have retrolental or vitreous cells. Some cases are associated with intermediate uveitis and leaking cystoid macular edema on fluorescein angiography.[93][94] Such patients may respond favorably with posterior subtenon triamcinolone acetonide, intravitreal, or systemic steroids.[95][96] Macular complications associated with RP include foveoschisis (non-leaking on fluorescein angiogram), CME (petaloid leak on fluorescein angiogram), macular holes, epiretinal membrane, vitreomacular traction, and choroidal neovascular membrane.[97] Myopia and astigmatism may be expected in patients with RP.[98] Both open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma may be associated with RP.[99][100] The prevalence of angle-closure glaucoma has been reported as 1% to 2.3% in populations of Canada and China, respectively.[101][102] Around 2% to 12% of patients with RP have primary open-angle glaucoma.[99] Around 68% of retinal detachments associated with RP are rhegmatogenous.[103] There may be an absence of complete posterior vitreous detachment and a predominance of round holes in younger patients. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy is common, and titration of laser burns is necessary during surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.[103] Coats disease-like exudative vitreoretinopathy may be noted in up to 5% of patients with RP.[104] Such manifestation is usually bilateral and may cause exudative retinal detachment.[104][105] Patients with RP may develop retinal vascular abnormalities like microaneurysms, telangiectasia, and neovascularization.[106] These abnormalities can cause recurrent vitreous hemorrhage.[106]
When to see a doctor / red flag
Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)
The differential diagnosis for progressive vision loss is complex. RP is a clinical diagnosis confirmed by bilateral eye involvement with night vision disturbance and gradual loss of peripheral vision. Physical findings on fundoscopic examination reveal bone spicule pigmentation, with vascular narrowing and optic disc pallor. Note that there are variants of RP with significant differences in physical findings.
Retinitis punctata albescens (RPA, also called progressive RPA) is an autosomal recessive variant of RP that frequently presents as night blindness in childhood. Mutations in RLBP1 usually cause this condition.[74] On direct fundoscopic examination, findings include less prominent (or even absent) disc pallor, less pronounced vascular narrowing, and bony spicules are rare or absent altogether. Instead, small white spots cover the majority of the fundus in RPA. Awareness of such variants is necessary to avoid excluding RP and its subclasses from the differential.[74] RPA is progressive with a progressive decline of visual fields and other visual parameters compared to fundus albipunctatus (congenital stationary night blindness), which is a stationary (nonprogressive) disease. However, a mutation in the RLBP1 is known to be associated with Bothnia retinal dystrophy, fundus albipunctatus, and Newfoundland rod-cone dystrophy. Thus, there is a phenotypic variability.[75]
Other diseases may mimic the early findings of this condition; careful evaluation is necessary to make the correct diagnosis. One possible mimic is cone-rod dystrophy. This progressive retinopathy can be differentiated from RP by the onset of dyschromatopsia before nyctalopia, as the cone photoreceptors are affected rather than the rods. Another consideration for nyctalopia in childhood is congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB).[76][77] CSN presents with 2 types and nyctalopia in childhood. The first type is CSNB (both Riggs and Schubert-Bornstein type), which presents without abnormalities on the fundoscopic exam. The second type has visual fundoscopic abnormalities, including Oguchi disease and fundus albipunctatus. Oguchi disease is associated with the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon in which the fundus has a golden sheen on exposure to light, and the typical color of the fundus reappears after prolonged dark adaptation.[78] Fundus albipunctata is characterized by small yellowish-white round dots sparing the fovea and extending to or beyond the mid-periphery. As previously mentioned, these conditions are nonprogressive.[77]
Chorioretinal infections, such as syphilis, cytomegalovirus, or even Lyme disease, may produce symptoms suggestive of RP. Take a careful history to help identify these possibilities and perform laboratory testing for confirmation.
Vision loss can result from multiple other diseases, including sarcoidosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Systemic involvement, in addition to vision loss, should prompt a thorough assessment of these diseases and other inflammatory processes. Also, consider trauma and Vitamin A deficiency, especially in children or adults with recent onset acquired nyctalopia. In older patients with recent onset of nyctalopia and retinal changes similar to RP, cancer-associated retinopathy and possible occult malignancy should be ruled out.[79]
Unilateral retinitis pigmentosa (URP) is a rare retinitis pigmentosa that affects only one eye. According to results from multiple studies, URP diagnosis occurs only after ruling out all possible infective causes, and the affected eye shows all the clinical signs of retinitis pigmentosa. In contrast, the unaffected eye remains completely normal.[80] However, the exact cause of most cases of this condition remains a mystery. Electroretinography and electrooculography help diagnose URP, as the affected eye will show greatly diminished rod function and nonrecordable or severely decreased electroretinogram responses, while the unaffected eye remains normal. Patients with URP often do not notice symptoms in the eye, though the condition can be present from birth. Some cases of URP appear to be genetic. Mukhopadhyay and colleagues described a patient with a germline mutation in the RP1 gene who developed URP. However, the cause remains unclear of this patient's unilateral expression of the disease.[81] Whether URP represents a distinct clinical entity or an abortive form of bilateral retinitis pigmentosa is still debated.
Diseases that can cause features similar to URP (called unilateral pseudo RP) or unilateral pigmentary retinopathy include
Inflammation: diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN), acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR), severe posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis
Trauma: blunt trauma (after resolution of commotion retinae or spontaneously settled retinal detachment), retained intraocular foreign body (iron foreign body-siderosis), forceps-associated birth trauma
Infection: syphilis, cytomegalovirus, measles, rubella, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis
Autoimmune disorders: autoimmune retinopathy (AIR)
Malignancy: cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR, paraneoplastic syndrome),[79] choroidal melanoma
Drug toxicity: chloroquine, thioridazine, phenothiazine, hydroxychloroquine, oral contraceptives, cephaloridine
Other retinal disorders: self-settled retinal detachment [82] 
Vascular diseases: ophthalmic artery occlusion [83]
Syndromic RP
RP usually occurs as an isolated condition (nonsyndromic RP) but may be associated with several syndromes and genetic disorders. These syndromes often involve RP as one of their clinical features, along with other systemic manifestations. Important syndromes associated with RP include the following:
Usher syndrome: Usher syndrome is the most common syndrome associated with RP. Around 18% of all patients with RP may have Usher syndrome.[84] Sensorineural hearing loss and, in some cases, vestibular (balance) issues characterize this condition. There are 3 main types of Usher syndrome, each with different genetic causes and degrees of severity.
Bardet-Biedl syndrome: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by RP, obesity, kidney dysfunction, extra fingers or toes (polydactyly), and other features such as intellectual disability and developmental delays.[85] Multiple genes can be involved in BBS, leading to significant variability in clinical presentation.
Joubert Syndrome: Joubert syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by aplasia of the cerebellar vermis, causing the "molar tooth sign" on brain imaging and a range of neurological and systemic features. Some individuals with Joubert syndrome may also develop RP.
Senior-Løken Syndrome: Senior-Løken syndrome combines the features of nephronophthisis and RP. This condition is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early-onset kidney disease and progressive vision loss.
Refsum Disease: Refsum disease is a metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of phytanic acid in the body and can lead to RP, as well as other symptoms such as ataxia (difficulty with coordination), peripheral neuropathy, and cardiac issues.
Kearns-Sayre syndrome: Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a rare mitochondrial disorder characterized by external ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of eye muscles), cardiac conduction defects, and pigmentary retinopathy resembling RP.
Abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig disease): This is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by low or absent plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Other features include RP, acanthocytosis, spinocerebellar degeneration, and fat malabsorption.[86]
Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA): Some forms of NBIA, a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by abnormal iron accumulation in the brain, may present with retinal abnormalities resembling RP. The most typical variant (pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, PKAN) shows the "eye of the tiger" sign on a T2-weighted magnetic resonance image due to a hyperintense signal at the center of the globus pallidus.
Other systemic diseases associated with RP include familial isolated vitamin E deficiency and Alström syndrome.
These syndromes often have underlying genetic mutations that affect multiple organ systems, including the retina. It is important to note that the severity and specific clinical manifestations can vary widely among individuals with the same syndrome due to genetic heterogeneity and the influence of other genetic and environmental factors. Genetic testing and a multidisciplinary approach involving ophthalmologists, geneticists, and other specialists are typically necessary for accurate diagnosis and management of this condition.

Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
epidemiology
Nonsyndromic RP has a worldwide prevalence of about 1 in 5000 individuals.[1] RP constitutes around 50% of the cases of inherited retinal diseases, and [8] affects more than 1.5 million people worldwide [14] with varying prevalence. Estimates in prevalence range from 1 in 3026 in Denmark [15] to 1 in 4869 in Birmingham, UK,[16] and as high as 1 in 372 in rural India.[17] Some of this variation may be due to differences in methodology and case definitions across studies; furthermore, the prevalence may be higher in some populations with more consanguineous marriages, as seen in certain Middle Eastern and South Asian countries.[17][18]
Men are affected slightly more often than women due to the X-linked form being expressed more frequently in males. Syndromic RP is much less common, with estimates for Usher syndrome ranging from 4 to 17 cases per 100,000 individuals.[19] 
The average age of symptom onset is dependent on the genetic type involved. The autosomal recessive form will develop symptoms in the early adolescent years, but those affected with autosomal dominant RP will likely not have symptoms until well into their 20s. More than three-quarters of individuals with RP will be symptomatic and present for clinical evaluation and diagnosis of the disease by the time they are 30 years.[14] In a study conducted in Japan, the average age of diagnosis was 35.1 years (median age 36.5 years).[

SCLERITIS AND EPISCLERITIS
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
What is scleritis?
Scleritis is the inflammation of your sclera, normally the white part of your eye. When you have scleritis, the white part of your eye becomes red.
Scleritis often involves piercing pain in your eye that gets worse with eye movement. It can cause permanent damage and vision loss. Treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids. It may be caused by an underlying inflammatory disease, fungus or injury.
Scleritis should be treated. Don’t try to wait for it to go away on its own.
What are the types of scleritis?
There are two main types of scleritis: anterior (referring to the front of your sclera) and posterior (referring to the back of your sclera). Both anterior and posterior scleritis can also be diffuse, nodular or necrotizing.
Diffuse scleritis: Diffuse scleritis is scattered all across your sclera. It’s the most common type.
Nodular scleritis: Nodular scleritis is concentrated in one spot of the sclera. You can usually see the lump (nodule).
Necrotizing scleritis: This most severe form of scleritis. It causes the most damage. It can destroy eye tissue and even result in the loss of your entire eye. There’s a form of necrotizing scleritis called scleromalacia perforans. It may not be painful but it can cause perforations (holes). This type accounts for 4% of scleritis.
Anterior scleritis, occurring at the front of the sclera, is the most common type of scleritis. Posterior scleritis, which affects the back of the sclera, represents about 10% of all cases of scleritis.
Who does scleritis affect?
Scleritis usually affects people who are 47 to 60 years old. But people who are younger or older can get it, too. The condition is more common in females than in males, in part due to the association of scleritis with autoimmune conditions. But males tend to have higher rates of scleritis caused by an infection.
How common is scleritis?
Each year, healthcare providers diagnose about 10,500 cases of scleritis in the United States. This works out to about 4-6 cases per 100,000 people.
Causes and risk factors
What causes scleritis?
Sometimes, scleritis has no known cause. Healthcare providers call this “idiopathic.” In many other cases, you may get scleritis if you have another type of medical condition, like an autoimmune illness. Other symptoms or conditions in this category include:
Rheumatoid arthritis. This condition affects the joints on both sides of your body. Rheumatoid arthritis is the immune system condition most often associated with scleritis.
Connective tissue diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus and its chronic inflammation disrupt many parts of your body, which may include your joints, your skin and organs — like your lungs, brain, kidneys and heart.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This term describes a group of disorders that cause chronic inflammation in your intestines.
Sjögren’s syndrome. This autoimmune disorder restricts the amount of moisture provided by glands in your eyes and mouth.
Scleroderma. In this disorder, normal tissue is replaced with dense, thick fibrous tissue.
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. This disease is the result of inflammation within your tissues (granulomatous inflammation) and blood vessels (vasculitis), which can damage organ systems.
Scleritis can also be associated with:
Infections. Certain infections cause infectious scleritis. These can be bacterial, fungal or viral. Fungal infections usually have a less positive outlook than bacterial or viral infections. Lyme disease may also cause scleritis (Lyme scleritis).
Trauma or injury to your eye, including surgical procedures. This type of injury often gives rise to infectious scleritis. In fact, one example of this is something called surgically induced necrotizing scleritis (SINS).
Medications used to treat or prevent bone disease. These types of drugs include bisphosphonates and are known to cause inflammatory eye reactions.
Signs and symptoms
The signs and symptoms of scleritis include:
Redness and swelling of your sclera.
Pain and tenderness in your eye, often severe enough to wake you up at night. It can also spread to other parts of your face.
Watering (tearing) eyes.
Sensitivity to light (photophobia).

Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
What tests will be done to diagnose scleritis?
Your provider may be able to determine if you have scleritis by giving you an eye exam, which may include a slit lamp exam.
If you have posterior scleritis, your provider may order a computed tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound.
If your scleritis is caused by an infection, your provider may take a smear of eye discharge to send to the lab. In very few cases, your provider might order a biopsy.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment
How is scleritis treated?
If you have a very mild case of scleritis, your provider may recommend using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). But your provider is more likely to prescribe a systemic corticosteroid, like prednisone, for a longer period of time (seven to 10 days).
If you get inflammation again, you may need intravenous corticosteroids.
If you have an infectious version of scleritis, you may need an antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral.
For necrotizing scleritis, your provider may work with a rheumatologist to prescribe other medications, including immunotherapeutic drugs like cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or biologic agents like rituximab and adalimumab.
Other treatments may include scleral patching or grafts, which use other types of tissue as implants.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of developing scleritis?
In many cases, you can’t prevent scleritis. But you can take good care of your eyes.
You can reduce your risk of damaging your eyes by wearing the required eye protection when you’re at work or participating in certain contact sports.
You can reduce your risk of eye infections by always making sure your hands are clean if you have to touch your eyes. Also, make sure you clean your contact lenses if you wear them.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have scleritis?
Scleritis can — and should — be treated. Untreated scleritis can result in vision loss. Posterior necrotizing scleritis can be the most damaging. Your provider will also work with you to treat any other autoimmune conditions you may have.
Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider about scleritis?
You should see your healthcare provider any time you have pain, redness or swelling in one or both eyes. This is especially true if you have some type of immune system disorder.
Additional Common Questions
What’s the difference between scleritis and episcleritis?
Scleritis affects your sclera. Episcleritis affects your episclera, or the outermost layer of tissue in your sclera. Episcleritis usually resolves on its own.
What’s the difference between scleritis and uveitis?
The uvea is the layer of the eye that lies underneath the sclera (the white of the eye). Inflammation of your uvea is called uveitis. Your uvea and sclera can both be inflamed at the same time, but they’re two different parts of your eye.
What’s the difference between scleritis and conjunctivitis?
Scleritis involves your sclera, while conjunctivitis (pink eye) involves the inflammation of your conjunctiva. Your conjunctiva covers your sclera and the inside of your eyelid. Both conditions may cause eye redness, but pink eye isn’t as serious and doesn’t cause the pain that scleritis does.

Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)
dd
The most common differential diagnosis for patients with suspected infectious scleritis is autoimmune scleritis, as both manifest with similar signs and symptoms.[2][10] Alternate diagnoses include episcleritis and anterior uveitis.[15][28] Patients with systemic diseases such as vasculitis and syphilis have also been known to show symptoms similar to scleritis. A systemic workup can differentiate these from scleritis.[24]

Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
epidemiology
One study reported that in 56 eyes with infectious scleritis, the median time from the inciting event was 1.9 months. Patients with a history of pterygium surgery had a median time of 49 months (range 0-183 months) after surgery before developing infectious scleritis. This duration is significantly longer than those with glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal surgery (median 1.0 to 1.6 months). The study also noted a median age of 70, suggesting that age might be a factor in developing this condition.[7] The pathogens more commonly responsible for infectious scleritis are Pseudomonas aeruginosa in developed countries and Nocardia or fungi in developing countries.[1]
What is episcleritis?
Episcleritis is the medical name for inflammation (swelling), irritation and reddening of your episclera. Blood vessels in the eye get bigger, making it look red or pink. Episcleritis often affects only one eye but can affect both.
Your episclera is a layer of clear tissue that covers the white part of your eyes (sclera). It’s in between your sclera and the lining of your eyelids (the conjunctiva).
Who does episcleritis affect?
Episcleritis can affect anyone. But it usually happens more often in women between the ages of 47 and 60.
How common is this condition?
Each year in the United States, about 41 in 100,000 people are diagnosed with episcleritis.
Are there types of episcleritis?
There are two types of episcleritis. One is called simple episcleritis. You may have a limited red area in your eye (sectoral) or an area of redness may cover most of your eye (diffuse).
Episcleritis may start suddenly, which your healthcare provider will call “acute onset.” In simple episcleritis, your eye might get worse at 12 hours and then get better over two to three days.
Another type is nodular episcleritis. This type has a raised lump (nodule) of inflammation in your episclera. Nodular episcleritis often starts gradually rather than suddenly.
Symptoms and Causes
What are the signs and symptoms of episcleritis?
Signs and symptoms of episcleritis may include:
Reddening and irritation of the whites of your eyes.
Inflammation (swelling) of your eyes.
Tearing (watering) of your eyes.
Eye discomfort, but not actual pain.
What causes episcleritis?
In many cases, episcleritis has no known cause (it’s idiopathic). In other cases, episcleritis may be associated with inflammatory and immune system disorders. These types of diseases include:
Rheumatoid arthritis. This is a type of arthritis where your immune system attacks the tissue lining your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis affects joints on both sides of your body.
Lupus. Also known as systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus is an autoimmune disease that causes swelling and pain throughout your body. It can cause joint pain, skin issues and problems with organs.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A group of disorders that cause pain and swelling in your intestines. If it lasts a long time (is chronic), it can damage the tissue.
Rosacea. This condition primarily affects the skin on your face, causing redness that’s tough to get rid of. It can also cause problems with your eyes.
Behçet’s disease. This is a chronic condition caused by inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis).
Some infections may cause episcleritis. These include:
Lyme disease. This condition is caused by a bacterium (singular of bacteria). It’s transmitted by a tick bite.
Syphilis. This is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can damage your health significantly.
Herpes infections.
Cat scratch fever, also called cat scratch disease. This infection is caused by a bacterium in cat saliva.
Sometimes healthcare providers note other factors — like stress, allergies and hormonal fluctuations — when a person has episcleritis. But they aren’t necessarily triggers of episcleritis.
Diagnosis and Tests
What tests will be done to diagnose episcleritis?
Your eye care provider will most likely be able to diagnose episcleritis with an eye exam. They’ll also ask you about your health history, especially about any immune system disorders.
Your provider may need additional tests, like lab tests of your blood and/or imaging tests, to find out if you have an immune system or inflammatory disorder.
Management and Treatment
How is episcleritis treated?
Your provider may prescribe eye drops that contain corticosteroids. Your provider may also suggest using a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Using eye drops or NSAIDs can make the condition clear up more quickly.
If you have an issue with your immune system along with episcleritis, your provider will work with a rheumatologist to ensure that you get the treatment you need.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of developing episcleritis?
Since there’s often no way of telling what’s causing episcleritis, there’s no real way to prevent it from happening.
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have episcleritis?
If you have episcleritis, the outlook is generally good. It’s not uncommon, though, for episcleritis to come back more than once.
If you have simple episcleritis, it’ll probably clear up on its own in two to three weeks. The eye drops or NSAIDs help your symptoms go away sooner.
There’ve been infrequent reports of complications from using steroids to treat episcleritis. These complications may include glaucoma or cataract development.
Living With
How do I take care of myself if I have episcleritis?
You can use cool compresses and chill your eye drops to make your eyes feel better.
If your provider agrees, you can take NSAIDs for the discomfort and inflammation.
When should I see my healthcare provider about episcleritis?
You should see or talk to your healthcare provider at the beginning of an episcleritis episode, especially if you’ve never had this kind of thing happen before.
If you find that the efforts you’re making to manage episcleritis aren’t working, or if things get worse, you should see your healthcare provider immediately.
epidemiology
Episcleritis is most commonly diagnosed in young to middle-aged females and is rarely diagnosed in children. There is no consensus on general population incidence and prevalence because these studies are not published in the literature. However, it is known that diffuse episcleritis is significantly more prevalent than the nodular form of the condition. Diffuse episcleritis occurs in about 70% of patients; whereas, nodular episcleritis occurs in only about 30% of patients.[2][4]
It is also well established that the incidence and prevalence of episcleritis are higher in populations with systemic collagen-vascular disease and autoimmune diseases. In one study, recurrent episcleritis in the same or contralateral eye occurred in about 30% of patients.[1] The global statistics may likely be more as patients may self-diagnose and treat recurrent episodes.
dd
Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of episcleritis is not common. The differential diagnosis list includes conditions that may appear to be similar to episcleritis, but after a thorough history and eye exam, misdiagnosis is uncommon.
Contact lens-associated red eye (CLARE) is a condition that may have a similar presentation to episcleritis but has a history and disease characteristics that make it difficult to mistake it for another condition. The patient affected by CLARE will have recently slept in their contact lenses and will have symptoms of unilateral pain, photophobia, and epiphora with normal visual acuity. The conjunctiva and cornea will show signs of inflammation, including corneal infiltrate and corneal edema and iritis, if severe.
A second condition on the differential diagnosis list should be acute conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis is a broad term to include viral, bacterial, allergic/atopic, and toxic etiologies. Conjunctivitis most likely presents with an acute red eye with discharge, photophobia, itching/burning, and edematous eyelids. Depending on the specific cause, the patient will also exhibit conjunctival follicles, papillae, or a combination.
Sectoral conjunctival erythema and edema occur with phlyctenular conjunctivitis as well. This condition is caused by a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to antigens in the tear film and is often associated with blepharitis.
A mechanical inflammation of pinguecula causes pingueculitis. This is common when pingueculae are larger or co-occur with dry eye. Distinguishing features are that the inflamed area is associated with a pinguecula.
Iritis is another condition that may initially present similar to episcleritis, but the specific exam findings of iritis make it easy to differentiate. Patients with iritis will also have an acute onset of pain, redness, photophobia, and tearing.  The conjunctival hyperemia is usually more concentrated in the circumlimbal area and is appropriately named ciliary flush. Distinguishing features of iritis are keratic precipitates on the corneal endothelium and cells and flare in the anterior chamber.
Scleritis is the most important condition to differentiate from episcleritis because the treatment of scleritis is more aggressive and can affect prognosis and complications. Patients with scleritis will complain of a more gradual onset of redness, pain, tearing, photophobia, and may have reduced visual acuity. These patients have deep, severe radiating pain from the affected eye, and their sclera will have a more red-purple hue. The hyperemia will not blanch with topical phenylephrine drops, and they may also have corneal involvement with peripheral stromal keratitis. More than 50% of patients with scleritis have a known systemic autoimmune connective tissue disease or vasculitis.[1] The treatment regimen for scleritis includes topical steroids and oral NSAIDs similar to episcleritis, but patients often need to be treated with oral steroids or subconjunctival steroid injections. Severe cases may require management with immunosuppressants with potentially devastating associated side effects such as azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil.

Episcleritis: What It Is, Causes & Treatment

STARGARDT DISEASE
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
What Is Stargardt Disease?
Stargardt disease is an eye condition that affects the macula and side parts of the retinas in your eyes. The macula is the part of your retina that lets you see objects directly in front of you (your central vision). Stargardt disease makes you lose your central vision over time. It can also affect your peripheral vision.
Stargardt disease is a type of macular degeneration. Most people with macular degeneration develop it later in life (after age 60). This is called age-related macular degeneration. Stargardt disease usually affects children and adults younger than 20. That’s why healthcare providers sometimes call it juvenile macular degeneration or juvenile macular dystrophy. It’s also known as fundus flavimaculatus when it affects the edges of your retina.
Stargardt disease happens when your body can’t get rid of a fatty yellow pigment called lipofuscin. If you have Stargardt disease, your body makes too much of it. The extra lipofuscin collects in your retina. It damages special cells called photoreceptors. Eventually, the damage permanently affects your vision.
Symptoms and Causes
Symptoms of Stargardt disease
Stargardt disease will cause noticeable changes in your eyes and vision, including:
Blind spots or cloudy areas in your vision
Blurry vision
Light sensitivity
New color blindness
Trouble adjusting to changes in lighting
Worsened night vision
Stargardt disease symptoms are usually progressive. This means they get worse over time. Eventually, you’ll lose some or all of your central vision. You might still be able to see out of the sides of your eyes. But you won’t be able to clearly see objects directly in front of you.
Stargardt disease causes
Stargardt disease is a genetic condition. It happens when there’s a genetic change in the ABCA4 gene. This gene helps your retinas work correctly.
Stargardt disease is hereditary. Biological parents pass it to their children. Stargardt disease is passed through families in an autosomal recessive pattern. That means both biological parents need to have a changed ABCA4 gene for their biological children to develop Stargardt disease.
Diagnosis and Tests
How doctors diagnose Stargardt disease
An eye doctor will diagnose Stargardt disease. They’ll give you an eye exam to check your vision and eye health. Tell your provider when you first noticed changes in your vision or other symptoms.
You might need a few tests, including:
Electroretinography (ERG)
Fluorescein angiography
Fundus photography and fundus autofluorescent photography
Genetic testing
Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
Stargardt disease stages
Your eye care specialist may classify Stargardt disease with stages as it progresses, including:
Stage 1. Flecks of excess lipofuscin form in your macula. You might have mild symptoms.
Stage 2. The flecks have built up enough to spread beyond your macula to other areas of your retina around it. Symptoms will be more noticeable.
Stage 3. The flecks have absorbed back into your macula and damaged it (they cause atrophy). This will cause worsening symptoms.
Stage 4. The atrophy in your macula is severe enough to erase some or all of your central vision.
Management and Treatment
How is Stargardt disease treated?
There’s no treatment to reverse Stargardt disease or the damage it causes. Your eye care specialist will suggest ways to manage symptoms and slow down the vision loss, including:
Avoiding dietary supplements that contain vitamin A (getting too much vitamin A may speed up vision loss if you have Stargardt disease)
Glasses, contacts and/or specific low vision aids
Quitting smoking (and other forms of nicotine, like vaping)
Wearing a hat or sunglasses to protect your eyes when you go outside
Is Stargardt disease curable?
Your eye care specialist can help you manage Stargardt disease, but you can’t cure it.
Researchers are conducting clinical trials to find ways to treat all types of macular degeneration (including Stargardt disease). Ask your eye care specialist if you’d be a good fit for a clinical trial. This can help you get access to new, experimental treatments.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Prevention tips
Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have Stargardt disease?
You should expect to lose your central vision. Most people experience vision loss slowly over several years. It sometimes takes decades. But it can happen faster. How your ABCA4 gene is changed can affect how quickly you lose your vision. This can also control how much of your vision you lose. Your eye doctor will help you understand what to expect.
You’ll need regular eye exams to monitor changes in your eyes. Ask your eye care specialist how often you should schedule routine exams and any follow-up tests.
Living With
How do I take care of myself with Stargardt disease?
You can take care of yourself in many ways by eating a nutritious diet and getting enough exercise. Don’t smoke. Deal with stress as it comes. Keep your regular schedule of appointments with your healthcare providers.
When should I see my healthcare provider if I have Stargardt disease?
Your eye care specialists will want to see you on a regular basis. Make sure you keep those appointments. However, if you have any changes in vision or any type of pain, you should contact your provider right away.

Differential diagnosis (how it’s distinguished from other illnesses)
dd
Several inherited macular dystrophies have a clinical appearance similar to STGD1. Distinguishing STGD1 among these similar-appearing conditions is essential for prognostication, systemic associations, and genetic counseling.[70]
Pattern Dystrophy 
Marmor and Byers were the first to propose “pattern dystrophy” when describing a spectrum of characteristic fundus patterns (ie, butterfly, reticular pigmentary). Pattern dystrophy (PD) most commonly masquerades as STGD1.[71] PD is an autosomal dominant condition with mild or no visual loss in the second to fifth decade. PD associated with the PRPH2 gene (multifocal pattern dystrophy simulating fundus flavimaculatus) primarily manifests as a macular disease. However, the phenotype may range from macular flecks to diffuse pigmentation in the periphery. Peripapillary sparing is a characterization of PD similar to STGD1. However, PD is associated with a higher incidence of CNVM. FFA helps distinguish the two as there will be window defects in PD, in contrast to a “masked choroid” in STGD1.[72]
Autosomal Dominant Stargardt-like Macular Dystrophies
These dystrophies include variants associated with the ELOVL4 (STGD2 or STGD3) and the PROM1 (STGD4) genes.[70]
Batten Disease/Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis 
Defects in the processing of lysosomal storage characterize Batten disease/juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a rare metabolic disease. These defects lead to apoptosis of both the photoreceptor (retina) and the neuronal (brain) cells. Visual loss and severe color vision deficiency are common, and the life expectancy of patients with this condition is usually 20 to 30 years.
The disease progression is usually rapid. Ocular examination shows vascular attenuation and optic disc pallor. OCT reveals a thinned retinal nerve fiber layer, while dark-adapted full-field ERG shows an absent or electronegative wave. Maintain high suspicion in younger patients diagnosed with severe STGD1 with rapid progression.[73]
Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness or Other Mitochondrial Diseases (Including Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-Like Episodes)
Patients with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) or other mitochondrial diseases present in the third to seventh decade. Ocular examination shows pigmentary changes at the macula, areas of RPE atrophy, and fleck-like deposits.[74] FAF shows hyperautofluorescent spots with corresponding subretinal deposits on OCT. Patients with this condition have distinguishing features such as personal or family history of early-onset diabetes mellitus and hearing loss. Other distinguishing features include the absence of a dark choroid on FFA and the presence of outer retinal tubulations on OCT.[75]
Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
This condition can mimic late-onset STGD1, as the flecks may be mistaken for drusens. A careful examination can help distinguish the two, as drusen tend to become confluent toward the center of the macula. Flecks show intense hyper AF, while drusens may be mildly hyperautofluorescent or hypoautofluorescent.[76] Sub-RPE accumulation on OCT characterizes drusens, while STGD1 is associated with hyperreflective thickening of the RPE. Age-related macular degeneration does not show a dark choroid on FFA.
Pentosan Polysulfate Maculopathy 
This condition is associated with the intake of pentosan, used in treating interstitial cystitis. The FAF changes may not spare the peripapillary region in pentosan polysulfate maculopathy

epidemiology
Although Stugardt disease is the most common cause of juvenile macular dystrophy, its prevalence in the United States is estimated to be 10 to 12.5 per 100,000 individuals.[2] Cornish et al. estimated the annual incidence of this condition in the United Kingdom to be around 0.110 to 0.128 per 100,000 individuals.[18] A study conducted in the Netherlands found the incidence of Stargardt disease to be 1.67 to 1.95 per 1,000,000 individuals per year.[19] The point prevalence of Stargardt disease was 1:22,000 to 1:19,000 in 2018 in the Netherlands.[1

Stargardt Disease: What It Is, Symptoms & Treatment
STRABISMUS
ALTERNATIVE NAMES: Strabismus is also known as heterotopia, squint, cast, cross-eyes, wall-eyes, esotropia, exotropia, hypotropia, hypertropia, misalignment of the eyes.
DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION
This is a disorder in which there is a misalignment or deviation of the eyes with each other, and they do not line up in the same direction, they do not look at the same object at the same time, which can lead to double vision or amblyopia(lazy eye) if untreated. The most common form of strabismus is known as “crossed eyes”
Other disorders associated with strabismus in children include: 
Apert syndrome 
Cerebral palsy 
Congenital rubella 
Hemangioma near the eye during infancy 
Incontinentia pigmenti syndrome 
Noonan syndrome 
Prader-Willi syndrome 
Retinopathy of prematurity 
Retinoblastoma 
Traumatic brain injury 
Trisomy 18 

CAUSES
Six different muscles surround each eye and work "as a team." This allows both eyes to focus on the same object. 
In someone with strabismus, these muscles do not work together. As a result, one eye looks at one object, while the other eye turns in a different direction and looks at another object. 
When this occurs, two different images are sent to the brain -- one from each eye. This confuses the brain. In children, the brain may learn to ignore (suppress) the image from the weaker eye. 
If the strabismus is not treated, the eye that the brain ignores will never see well. This loss of vision is called amblyopia. Another name for amblyopia is "lazy eye." Sometimes lazy eye is present first, and it causes strabismus. 
In most children with strabismus, the cause is unknown. In more than one half of these cases, the problem is present at or shortly after birth. This is called congenital strabismus. 
Most of the time, the problem has to do with muscle control, and not with muscle strength. 
Strabismus that develops in adults can be caused by: 
Botulism 
Diabetes (causes a condition known as acquired paralytic strabismus) 
Graves disease 
Guillain-Barré syndrome 
Injury to the eye 
Shellfish poisoning 
Stroke 
Traumatic brain injury 
Vision loss from any eye disease or injury 

RISK FACTORS
A family history of strabismus is a risk factor. Farsightedness may be a contributing factor, often in children. Any other disease that causes vision loss may also cause strabismus. 
Strabismus is more prevalent with certain syndromes like Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, Apert-Crouzon syndrome, premature infants with low birth weight, and children with affected parents or siblings. All siblings of a strabismic child should be screened at an early age for strabismus as sensorimotor anomalies are common in the pedigrees of strabismic probands. 
SIGNS / SYMPTOMS
Symptoms of strabismus may be present all the time or may come and go. Symptoms can include: 
Crossed eyes 
Double vision 
Eyes that do not aim in the same direction 
Uncoordinated eye movements (eyes do not move together) 
Loss of vision or depth perception 
It is important to note that children may never be aware of double vision. This is because amblyopia can develop quickly. 
DIAGNOSIS METHOD (EXAMS AND TESTS)
The health care provider will do a physical exam. This exam includes a detailed examination of the eyes. 
The following tests will be done to determine how much the eyes are out of alignment. 
Corneal light reflex 
Cover/uncover test 
Retinal exam 
Standard ophthalmic exam 
Visual acuity 
A brain and nervous system (neurological) exam will also be done. 
TREATMENT OPTIONS 
The first step in treating strabismus in children is to prescribe glasses, if needed. Next, amblyopia or lazy eye must be treated. A patch is placed over the better eye. This forces the brain to use the weaker eye and it develops better vision. 
Your child may not like wearing a patch or eyeglasses. A patch forces your child to see through the weaker eye at first. However, it is very important to use the patch or eyeglasses as directed. 
Eye muscle surgery may be needed if the eyes still do not move correctly. Different muscles in the eye will be made stronger or weaker. To strengthen a muscle, it is removed from the eye, shortened, then reattached. To weaken a muscle, it is removed from the eye and reattached further toward the back of the eye. Often in adults, an adjustable suture method is used so that the final adjustment of the position of the weakened muscle is made with the person awake and looking at a target. This has been shown to be more accurate. 
Eye muscle repair surgery does not fix the poor vision of a lazy eye. Muscle surgery will fail to improve vision if amblyopia has not been treated. A child may still have to wear glasses after surgery. Surgery is more often successful if done when the child is younger. 
Adults with mild strabismus that comes and goes may do well with glasses. Eye muscle exercises may help keep the eyes straight. More severe forms will require surgery to straighten the eyes. If strabismus has occurred because of vision loss, the vision loss will need to be corrected before strabismus surgery can be successful.  
Adult Strabismus (Crossed Eyes) Treatment 
There are several ways to treat strabismus in adults; they may include:
Adult strabismus (crossed eyes) surgery 
This is the most common treatment for strabismus. Surgery can improve eye alignment and help restore proper vision. 
Typically, strabismus occurs when the muscles around the eyes are either too stiff or too weak. An ophthalmologist can loosen, tighten, or move certain eye muscles so that the eyes line up properly to work together. More than one surgery may be needed to treat strabismus. 
Surgery is usually done as outpatient surgery in a hospital or surgery center, using either general or local anesthesia. Your ophthalmologist makes a small cut in the tissue covering the eye to reach the eye muscles. The muscles are then repositioned to help the eyes point in the same direction. This may need to be done in one or both eyes. After strabismus surgery, you can get back to your daily routine within a few days. 
Eye muscle exercises 
An ophthalmologist can teach you exercises to help you focus both eyes inward. These exercises can help if you have “convergence insufficiency.” That is when your eyes do not align properly for close tasks, like reading or computer work. 
Prism eyeglasses 
A prism is a clear, wedge-shaped lens that bends (refracts) light rays. A prism can be attached to eyeglasses or made as part of the lens. Prisms can help some people with mild double vision see one image, not two. 
Botulinum toxin (Botox®) 
In some cases, an injection (shot) of this drug in the eye muscles can help treat strabismus. It paralyzes the muscles that keep your eyes from aligning properly. The effect can last for just a few months, or it could permanently improve eye alignment. 
Prevention tips
OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
After surgery, the eyes may look straight, but vision problems can remain. 
The child may still have reading problems in school. Adults may have a hard time driving. Impaired vision may affect the ability to play sports. 
In most cases, the problem can be corrected if identified and treated early. Permanent vision loss in one eye may occur if treatment is delayed. If amblyopia is not treated by about age 11 years, it is likely to become permanent, However, new research suggests that a special form of patching and certain medicines may help to improve amblyopia, even in adults. About one third of children with strabismus will develop amblyopia. 
Many children will get strabismus or amblyopia again after successful treatment. Therefore, the child will need to be monitored closely. 
Possible complications
WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR/MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL
Strabismus should be evaluated promptly. Contact your provider or eye doctor if your child: 
Appears to be cross-eyed
Complains of double vision
Has difficulty seeing
Note: Learning and school problems can sometimes be due to a child’s inactivity to see the blackboard or reading material.
There Are Six Eye Muscles That Control Eye Movement 
One muscle moves the eye to the right, and one muscle moves the eye to the left. The other four muscles move the eye up, down, and at an angle. In order to focus on a single image, the muscles from both eyes must work together. 
How Does Adult Strabismus Affect Vision? 
With normal vision, both eyes aim at the same spot. The brain combines the two images from our eyes into a single, three-dimensional (3-D) image. This is how we can tell how near or far something is from us (called depth perception). 
When one eye is out of alignment, two different pictures are sent to the brain. In a young child, the brain learns to ignore the image of the misaligned eye. Instead, it sees only the image from the straight or better-seeing eye. As a result, the child loses depth perception. 
Adults who develop strabismus after childhood often have double vision. This is because their brains have already learned to receive images from both eyes. Their brains cannot ignore the image from the turned eye, so they see two images. 
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 
Differential diagnoses can be classified based on the type of defect. Important differentials to be considered are as follows: 
Congenital Esotropia 
Early-onset accommodative esotropia 
Abducens palsy 
Nystagmus blockage syndrome 
Duane retraction syndrome 
Sensory esotropia 
Strabismus fixus 
Moebius syndrome  
Fully Accommodative Esotropia 
Non-accommodative esotropia 
Congenital esotropia 
Cyclic esotropia 
Convergence excess and near esotropia  
Intermittent Exotropia 
Infantile exotropia 
Convergence weakness or insufficiency 
Sensory exotropia with poor unilateral vision  
 
It Is Never Too Late to Treat Strabismus 
You do not have to live with the discomfort and problems caused by misaligned eyes. With your ophthalmologist’s help, you can find a treatment for your strabismus.
REFERENCES: Strabismus - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf 
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
The prevalence of strabismus is 2% to 5% in the general population.. In the U.S., 5 to 15 million individuals are affected by strabismus. In a National Health Survey, exotropia was seen in 2.1% and esotropia in 1.2% of the population aged 4 to 74 years. This difference is due to the higher prevalence of exotropia in the population between 55 to 75 years of age.  
Fifty percent of all childhood esotropias are either fully or partially accommodative. Non-accommodative esotropia is seen in 10% of all strabismus cases and is the second most common form of childhood esotropia. Infantile esotropia affects 1 in every 100 to 500 persons, which accounts for 8.1% of cases of esotropia. 
Intermittent esotropia is seen in 1% of the population and is the most common form of exotropia. Exotropia is more prevalent in Asian and black populations. Women make up 60% to 70% of exotropia cases. 
STYE (HORDEOLUM)
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
A stye (or sty) is a painful red bump on the edge of your eyelid. It can look similar to an acne pimple and may be tender to the touch. A stye forms when a tiny oil-producing gland in your eyelash follicle or eyelid skin becomes blocked and a bacterial infection develops. The medical term for a stye is “hordeolum.” 

It’s common to have a stye on only one eyelid, but it’s also possible to get styes on both lids. A stye usually lasts one to two weeks and will typically go away on its own. But in cases where it doesn’t, you may need to rely on an eye care provider to drain it. They may also prescribe antibiotics to reduce the infection. 

A stye is similar to another eyelid bump called a chalazion. A chalazion is a bump that usually occurs farther back on your eyelid. Unlike a stye, a chalazion usually isn’t painful and isn’t caused by a bacterial infection. But treatment for both conditions is similar. 

Types of styes 

There are two types of styes: 

External styes: External styes form on the outer part of either your upper or lower eyelid. They’re the more common type. An infection in your eyelash follicle usually causes them. 

Internal styes: Internal styes form on either of your inner eyelids (facing your eyeball). An infection in the inner eyelid gland that produces oils that help keep your eyelid moist causes this type. 

Styes are very common. They’re more common in adults than children because the oil in an adult’s oil glands is thicker than a child’s. That means it’s more prone to blockage. 
Causes 
What causes a stye? 

A bacterial infection in your eyelid’s oil-producing glands causes most styes. The oil-producing glands line the eyelids and help lubricate the surface of your eye. 

Are styes contagious? 

Styes generally aren’t contagious. But small amounts of bacteria can be spread from them. This is why it’s important to always wash your hands before and after touching a stye and wash pillowcases often to help prevent the bacteria from spreading. Unless you’re cleaning or applying warm compresses to the stye, avoid touching it to reduce bacteria spread and irritation. 
What are the risk factors for developing a stye? 

Styes are very common, and anyone can get them. But you may be more likely to get a stye if you: 

Have had a stye before. 

Have blepharitis (an inflammation of your eyelids). 

Have certain skin conditions, like acne, rosacea or dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis). 

Have diabetes. 

Have dry skin. 

Are experiencing hormonal changes. 

Have high lipid levels (“bad” cholesterol). 

Signs and symptoms
Is That Bump on Your Eye a Stye or a Chalazion? 

What are the symptoms of a stye? 

The main symptom of a stye is a painful red bump along your eyelid edge near your eyelashes. Other stye symptoms may include: 

Swelling of your eyelid (sometimes your entire eyelid). 

Discharge from your eye. 

Crusting along your eyelid. 

Light sensitivity. 

Soreness and itching. 

Eye tearing. 

A scratchy feeling or a feeling that there’s something in your eye. 

Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Some styes are more stubborn and require a visit to a healthcare provider. If your vision seems to be affected or if your stye seems to be getting worse instead of better, contact a provider. 

During your appointment, your provider will examine your eyelid and ask about any additional symptoms you’re having. They’ll be able to diagnose a stye based on this eye exam. 
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Management and Treatment 

How do you get rid of a stye? 

A stye will usually go away by itself in one to two weeks. To feel better faster and reduce pain and swelling, you can use a self-care plan to treat your stye at home. Here are some dos and don’ts to manage your stye at home. 

Do 

Use warm compresses. Apply a warm washcloth to your eyelid for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, three to five times a day. Rewarm the washcloth by soaking it in warm water, wring and repeat. Many people believe that using green tea bags moistened in warm water as eye compresses will help the stye not only feel better, but also speed healing, due in part to the antibacterial properties of green tea. Some scientists have shown that a natural antioxidant in green tea breaks down the cell wall of the bacteria, killing it. While there’s debate about this among eye experts, it won’t hurt you and should be at least as effective as using a warm washcloth as a compress. 

Clean eyelids. Gently wipe away eye discharge with a mild soapy solution made from half baby shampoo and half water. You can also use eyelid wipes available in most drug stores. 

Don’t 

Squeeze or pop a stye. 

Rub or touch your eyelid. 

Wear makeup or contact lenses until the area has healed. 

How will an eye care provider treat a stye? 

If after 48 hours of stye self-care, your pain and swelling aren’t getting any better, it’s time to call your eye care provider. Stye treatment by a medical provider may include: 

A small cut (incision) to drain your stye in the office (under local anesthesia). 

Prescription antibiotic ointment to apply to your eyelid or antibiotic eye drops. Your provider may prescribe oral antibiotics in cases where the area around your eye is infected or after an incision is made to drain an internal stye. 

A steroid injection into the stye to reduce eyelid swelling. 
Prevention tips
Prevention 

The best way to prevent a stye is to practice good facial hygiene, including: 

Wash your hands thoroughly and often, especially before touching your face and eyes. 

Wash your hands before and after removing contact lenses. Clean your contacts with disinfectant and lens cleaning solution. Dispose of daily wear or other “limited use” lenses on the schedule that your eye care provider recommends. 

Washing your face to remove dirt and/or makeup before going to bed. 

Throwing away eye makeup every two to three months. Never share eye makeup with anyone else. 

Prognosis
Outlook / Prognosis 

How serious is a stye? 

Styes are usually harmless. They may cause some minor irritation and discomfort, but they typically go away on their own. Stye self-care measures like warm compresses can help speed up the healing process. 

Although it will be tempting to cover the stye with makeup, avoid doing this. Putting makeup on a stye can delay the healing process or even cause it to become more plugged up and infected, which, in turn, will make it more painful. 

Living With 

When should I see my healthcare provider? 

You should see your healthcare provider if: 

Your eye is swollen shut. 

Pus or blood is leaking from the bump. 

Pain and/or swelling increases after the first two to three days. 

Blisters have formed on your eyelid. 

Your eyelids feel hot. 

Your vision has changed. 

Styes keep coming back. If this happens, your provider may take a biopsy (a small sample of the stye), under local anesthesia, to rule out other more serious problems. 

What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? 

If you have a stye, you may want to ask your provider the following questions: 

Do styes usually go away on their own? 

How long will it take a stye to heal? 

What treatment options do you recommend? 

Do I need to miss school or work if I have a stye? 

If I’m in a lot of pain, can I take a pain reliever? 

Possible complications
When to see a doctor / red flag
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
A stye presents as a localized, painful, red, and swollen lesion on the eyelid. Conditions that can mimic this clinical entity must be ruled out to ensure accurate diagnosis and management. Below is a list of key differential diagnoses.
Chalazion: A chalazion is a chronic, nontender, firm nodule resulting from the blockage of a meibomian gland. Chalazia are typically painless and do not present with acute inflammation, which distinguishes them from styes, which are acute. Chalazia are chronic and often follow the resolution of a hordeolum.
Preseptal cellulitis: Preseptal cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the eyelid and periorbital tissues anterior to the orbital septum. This condition is characterized by diffuse eyelid swelling, redness, and tenderness but lacks a localized nodule or abscess. Unlike chalazia, preseptal cellulitis does not present with a fluctuant nodule or pus discharge and may be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as a low-grade fever.
Orbital cellulitis: This severe bacterial infection affects the tissues posterior to the orbital septum. Orbital cellulitis is distinguished by significant proptosis, restricted extraocular movement, and vision changes. Systemic symptoms such as high fever and malaise often accompany this pathology, making immediate imaging and hospitalization essential.
Sebaceous gland carcinoma: This rare but serious malignant tumor of the sebaceous glands often mimics a recurrent chalazion or hordeolum. Key differentiating features include a persistent or recurrent lesion that does not respond to appropriate treatment and the presence of eyelid margin abnormalities such as loss of eyelashes (madarosis). A biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis.
Blepharitis: This condition involves inflammation of the eyelid margin, often due to bacterial infection or meibomian gland dysfunction. Blepharitis is characterized by diffuse redness and scaling along the lid margins, often involving both eyes. This chronic condition is marked by irritation and crusting rather than acute painful swelling.
Dermoid cyst: This congenital lesion is commonly found along the orbital rim. A dermoid cyst is distinguished by being painless and noninflammatory, presenting as a firm and well-circumscribed mass.
Dacryocystitis: This condition involves infection of the lacrimal sac following obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. Dacryocystitis presents with swelling, redness, and tenderness localized to the inner corner of the eye near the lacrimal sac, often accompanied by tearing or purulent discharge.
Herpes simplex and zoster ophthalmicus: Herpes simplex is caused by the herpes simplex virus, while herpes zoster ophthalmicus arises from the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. These viral infections lead to inflammation of the eyelid. Herpes simplex is characterized by vesicles on the eyelid, while herpes zoster presents as a vesicular rash along the trigeminal nerve distribution, often accompanied by crusting and pain.
Molluscum contagiosum: This viral infection is caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus, presenting as dome-shaped, pearly papules on the eyelid. The lesions are painless and feature a central umbilication, distinguishing them from other conditions. Unlike styes and chalazia, molluscum contagiosum lesions do not show signs of inflammation or acute tenderness.
Accurate identification of the condition is essential to avoid inappropriate management, particularly with serious conditions like orbital cellulitis and sebaceous gland carcinoma, which require urgent treatment. When in doubt, referral to an ophthalmologist and additional investigations such as imaging or biopsy may be required. This structured approach ensures proper diagnosis and treatment while minimizing the risks of mismanagement.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
While hordeola are very common, the exact incidence is unknown. Every age and demographic is affected, although a slightly increased incidence is observed among patients aged 30 to 50. Prevalence differences among populations worldwide are unknown. Patients with chronic conditions such as seborrhoeic dermatitis, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia may also be at increased risk.
Prevalence in Different Regions
Styes are common worldwide, affecting individuals of all ages. While the exact prevalence is not well-documented, the occurrence is significantly influenced by risk factors such as poor eyelid hygiene, blepharitis, and meibomian gland dysfunction. Styes are more frequently observed in regions with poor access to healthcare or suboptimal hygiene practices.
Sex Distribution
Styes are slightly more common in female individuals. This trend is attributed to the frequent use of cosmetics and eye makeup in this group, which can block gland ducts and exacerbate bacterial colonization.
Age Distribution
Styes can occur in all age groups, but certain factors increase the risk for some individuals. Frequent eye rubbing and inadequate eyelid hygiene can make children and adolescents vulnerable to developing a stye. Conditions that increase susceptibility to hordeolum formation in adults include chronic blepharitis, rosacea, and meibomian gland dysfunction. Age-related changes in meibomian gland function and tear production can cause recurrent styes in older adults.
Associated Risk Factors
Styes are more frequent in individuals with the following conditions:
Blepharitis, which causes chronic eyelid inflammation
Diabetes, which impairs the immune response
Rosacea, which affects meibomian gland function and increases susceptibility to eyelid infections 
By understanding the epidemiology of styles, healthcare providers can better identify at-risk populations and emphasize preventive strategies, including proper eyelid hygiene and timely treatment of underlying conditions.

THYROID EYE DISEASE
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Thyroid eye disease also is called Graves' ophthalmopathy. About 25% of people with Graves' disease have eye symptoms. Thyroid eye disease affects muscles and other tissues around the eyes. Symptoms may include:
Bulging eyes.
A gritty feeling in the eyes.
Pressure or pain in the eyes.
Puffy eyelids or eyelids that don't cover the eyeball all the way. This is called retracted eyelids.
Red or inflamed eyes.
Light sensitivity.
Blurred or double vision.
Vision loss.
Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an inflammatory disorder that affects the tissues around your eyes, causing swelling, discomfort and other symptoms. It happens in some people who have autoimmune diseases that attack their thyroid gland. Most often, it happens in people who have Graves’ disease. In this case, your healthcare provider may call it Graves’ eye disease.
Although autoimmune diseases are lifelong, TED has distinct phases. It may be active for two years or more before the inflammation subsides. During this time, symptoms may come and go and may be mild to severe. TED is mild for most people. But when it’s severe, it can cause permanent damage, with lasting cosmetic and vision changes.
Ophthalmopathy and orbitopathy are two other terms for eye disease. Your healthcare provider may describe TED as:
Thyroid ophthalmopathy
Thyroid orbitopathy
Graves’ ophthalmopathy
Graves’ orbitopathy
Symptoms and Causes
Causes of thyroid eye disease
Thyroid eye disease is an autoimmune disease. This means your immune system attacks your thyroid and eye tissues. Graves’ disease is a common cause, but other autoimmune thyroid diseases, like Hashimoto’s disease, can also cause it. Even people with normal thyroid function can develop TED.
In these diseases, your immune system creates antibodies that mimic thyroid hormones and attach to thyroid hormone receptors. These receptors are mostly within your thyroid itself, but some are in the tissues behind your eyes. So, the same antibodies that affect your thyroid can also affect your eyes.
Thyroid eye disease risk factors
You may be more likely to get thyroid eye disease (Graves’ eye disease) if you:
Are female. Females are five times more likely to get Graves’ disease and Graves’ eye disease. (But when males get it, it’s more likely to be severe.)
Have high or low thyroid hormone levels. Abnormal thyroid hormone levels can contribute to TED. These hormones stimulate the same receptors in your eye tissues that the antibodies do.
Have had radioiodine therapy. RAI therapy is a standard treatment for overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), which Graves’ disease causes. But it may contribute to TED or make it worse.
Smoke. Smoking and secondhand smoke exposure significantly raise your risk of thyroid eye disease. Smoke exposure also makes you more likely to have more severe symptoms that last longer. If you have TED, the best thing you can do for your disease is quit smoking.
Thyroid eye disease symptoms
Typical thyroid ophthalmopathy symptoms include:
Bulging eyes (proptosis)
Eye irritation
Swollen and inflamed eyelids (blepharitis)
Dry eyes or teary eyes
Frequent blinking
Light sensitivity (photophobia)
Eye pain and headaches
Difficulty moving your eyes
Double vision (diplopia)
Symptoms normally affect both eyes, but sometimes, you may only notice symptoms in one eye.
Diagnosis and Tests
What tests will be done to diagnose thyroid eye disease?
A healthcare provider will be able to diagnose thyroid eye disease by doing a physical eye exam. They’ll be able to examine both your eyelids and your eyes.
If your healthcare provider thinks that you have thyroid eye disease, they’ll order blood tests to check if your thyroid hormone levels and antibodies are too high or too low.
Other tests your provider may request include:
Ultrasound of the eyes
Computed tomography (CT)
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for thyroid eye disease?
The treatment you’ll need will depend on what stage the disease is in and how severe it is. Supportive treatments can help ease your symptoms while thyroid eye disease is active. These might include home remedies, over-the-counter or prescription medications. After the active phase has ended, you might need or want cosmetic surgery or vision correction surgery.
Supportive treatments for thyroid eye disease may include:
Eye drops. During the active phase of TED, eye drops can help relieve your symptoms. Different types of eye drops can help with different symptoms, like dryness, redness or pain.
Selenium supplements. Selenium deficiency increases TED symptoms.
Scleral lenses. Similar to contact lenses, these lenses cover more of the surface of your eye, offering protection from the elements. You can also use them to apply medication.
Vision aids. If you have double vision, your eye care provider may suggest wearing an eye patch or special eyeglasses with prisms to help correct it while thyroid eye disease is active.
Thionamides. If you have hyperthyroidism (Graves’ eye disease), you may need medications to reduce your thyroid hormone levels. Examples include methimazole and propylthiouracil.
Corticosteroids. When TED symptoms are more severe, healthcare providers prescribe a short course of corticosteroids to bring the inflammation down. You may take them by mouth or IV (intravenously, through a vein).
Teprotumumab (Tepezza®). This newer drug became the first medication specifically approved to treat thyroid eye disease in the U.S. in 2020. It’s an alternative anti-inflammatory drug within the biologics category. More drugs like it are in development.
Radiation therapy. Your eye doctor may recommend that you see a radiation oncologist to consider radiation, which reduces inflammation by killing the immune cells that are active behind your eyes.
Your healthcare team can offer alternative treatments if these don’t work for you. Rarely, some people may need surgery during the active phase of Graves’ eye disease. But in most cases, you and your team will consider surgery after your condition has stabilized. At this point, it’ll be easier to tell which appearance and vision changes are likely to be permanent.
Surgery for Graves’ eye disease
Surgery for thyroid eye disease may include:
Orbital decompression surgery. This eye surgery may be necessary in the rare event that inflammation compresses your optic nerve. A surgeon will remove bone to reduce the compression. This surgery may also be done to reduce eye bulging after your condition has stabilized.
Thyroidectomy. This treats severe hyperthyroidism. If your healthcare team can’t control your thyroid hormone levels with medications, they might need to remove your thyroid gland.
Eyelid surgery. If your eyelids have retracted, you might need eyelid surgery to reposition them. This can improve your comfort as well as appearance and protect your eyes from exposure.
Eye muscle surgery. You might need surgery on your eye muscles if they’re scarred and restricting your eye movement, or you have double vision because your eyes are misaligned.
Oculoplastic surgery. Oculoplastic surgery adjusts the soft tissues and/or bones around your eyes. It can address cosmetic concerns like bulging eyes and bags around your eyes.
Corneal transplant. If your cornea was badly damaged by exposure during the active phase of Graves’ eye disease, you might consider replacing it with a transplant to improve your vision.
Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook for thyroid eye disease?
The outlook is good for most people with thyroid eye disease. Most have mild symptoms, which often resolve on their own. People over the age of 50 tend to have more severe symptoms. If you have a serious case of TED, you might need a combination of treatments to manage it. Some people have lasting changes to their eyes, which may require surgery.
Prevention tips
Complications of Graves’ eye disease
Appearance and vision changes that occur with thyroid eye disease may improve after the active phase is over, but they don’t always. Scarring can prevent the tissues around your eyes from healing and returning to their normal shape. Sometimes, parts of your eyes that affect your vision are permanently damaged. Surgery can treat some of these effects.
Lasting appearance changes may include:
Eyelid retraction
Protruding eyes
Baggy eyes
Red eyes
Lasting vision changes may include:
Blurry vision
Double vision
Severe vision loss
When to see a doctor / red flag
When should I call my healthcare provider?
When you have thyroid eye disease, it’s important to let your healthcare team know if your symptoms worsen. You should also let them know if you notice any changes in your vision. Some changes might need urgent treatment. Call right away if you notice:
Your field of vision has narrowed or closed off
Colors appear differently than they used to
Sudden, severe eye pain

Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves’ Eye Disease): Symptoms & Causes

Trachoma
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Trachoma (truh-KOH-muh) is a bacterial infection that affects your eyes. It's caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Trachoma is contagious, spreading through contact with the eyes, eyelids, and nose or throat secretions of infected people. It can also be passed on by handling infected items, such as handkerchiefs.
At first, trachoma may cause mild itching and irritation of your eyes and eyelids. Then you may notice swollen eyelids and pus draining from the eyes. Untreated trachoma can lead to blindness.
Trachoma is the leading preventable cause of blindness worldwide. Most trachoma cases occur in poor areas of Africa, where 85% of people with active disease reside. In areas where trachoma is prevalent, infection rates among children under 5 can be 60% or more.
Early treatment may help prevent trachoma complications.
Causes
Trachoma is caused by certain subtypes of Chlamydia trachomatis, a bacterium that can also cause the sexually transmitted infection chlamydia.
Trachoma spreads through contact with discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person. Hands, clothing, towels and insects can all be routes for transmission. In developing countries, eye-seeking flies also are a means of transmission.
Risk factors
Factors that increase your risk of contracting trachoma include:
Crowded living conditions. People living in close contact are at greater risk of spreading infection.
Poor sanitation. Poor sanitary conditions, inadequate access to water, and lack of hygiene, such as unclean faces or hands, help spread the disease.
Age. In areas where the disease is active, it's most common in children ages 4 to 6.
Sex. In some areas, women's rate of contracting the disease is two to six times higher than that of men. This may be attributed to the fact that women have more contact with children, who are the primary reservoir of infection.
Flies. People living in areas with problems controlling the fly population may be more susceptible to infection
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms of trachoma usually affect both eyes and may include:
Mild itching and irritation of the eyes and eyelids
Eye discharge containing mucus or pus
Eyelid swelling
Light sensitivity (photophobia)
Eye pain
Eye redness
Vision loss
Young children are particularly susceptible to infection. But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five stages in the development of trachoma:
Inflammation — follicular. The early infection has five or more follicles — small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell — visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva).
Inflammation — intense. In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid.
Eyelid scarring. Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification. Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion).
In-turned eyelashes (trichiasis). The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea).
Corneal clouding (opacity). The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea.
All the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid. Without intervention, a disease process that begins in childhood can continue to advance into adulthood.
Diagnosis methods (tests, lab work, imaging, etc.)
Diagnosis
Your doctor can diagnose trachoma through a physical examination or by sending a sample of bacteria from your eyes to a laboratory for testing. But lab tests aren't always available in places where trachoma is common.
Treatment options (medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.)
Treatment
Trachoma treatment options depend on the stage of the disease.
Medications
In the early stages of trachoma, treatment with antibiotics alone may be enough to eliminate the infection. Your doctor may prescribe tetracycline eye ointment or oral azithromycin (Zithromax). Azithromycin appears to be more effective than tetracycline, but it's more expensive.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends giving antibiotics to an entire community when more than 10% of children have been affected by trachoma. The goal of this guideline is to treat anyone who has been exposed to trachoma and reduce the spread of trachoma.
Surgery
Treatment of later stages of trachoma — including painful eyelid deformities — may require surgery.
In eyelid rotation surgery (bilamellar tarsal rotation), your doctor makes an incision in your scarred lid and rotates your eyelashes away from your cornea. The procedure limits the progression of corneal scarring and may help prevent further loss of vision.
If your cornea has become clouded enough to seriously impair your vision, corneal transplantation may be an option that could improve vision.
You may have a procedure to remove eyelashes (epilation) in some cases. This procedure may need to be done repeatedly.
Prevention tips
Prevention
If you've been treated for trachoma with antibiotics or surgery, reinfection is always a concern. For your protection and for the safety of others, be sure that family members or others you live with are screened and, if necessary, treated for trachoma.
Trachoma can occur worldwide but is more common in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim. When in regions where trachoma is common, take extra care in practicing good hygiene, which can help prevent infection.
Proper hygiene practices include:
Face washing and hand-washing. Keeping faces and hands clean may help break the cycle of reinfection.
Fly control. Reducing fly populations can help eliminate a source of transmission.
Proper waste management. Properly disposing of animal and human waste can reduce breeding grounds for flies.
Improved access to water. Having a fresh water source nearby can help improve hygienic conditions.
No trachoma vaccine is available, but prevention is possible. The WHO has developed a strategy to prevent trachoma, with the goal of eliminating it by 2020. While the goal hasn't been entirely achieved, trachoma cases have declined sharply. The strategy, titled SAFE, involves:
Surgery to treat advanced forms of trachoma
Antibiotics to treat and prevent the infection
Facial cleanliness
Environmental improvements, particularly in water, sanitation and fly control
Prognosis
Possible complications
Complications
One episode of trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis is easily treated with early detection and use of antibiotics. Repeated or secondary infections can lead to complications, including:
Scarring of the inner eyelid
Eyelid deformities, such as an inward-folding eyelid (entropion) or ingrown eyelashes (trichiasis), which can scratch the cornea
Corneal scarring or cloudiness
Partial or complete vision loss

When to see a doctor / red flag
Call your doctor if you or your child has itchy or irritated eyes or discharge from the eyes, especially if you live in or recently traveled to an area where trachoma is common. Trachoma is a contagious condition. Treating it as soon as possible helps prevent serious infection.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Trachoma is hyperendemic in many of the poorest and most rural areas of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East.
It is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people. It causes about 1.4% of all blindness worldwide.
Overall, Africa remains the most affected continent and the one with the most intensive control efforts.
As of 21 October 2024, 21 countries – Benin, Cambodia, China, Gambia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Ghana, India, Iraq, Malawi, Mali, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Togo, Vanuatu and Viet Nam – had been validated by WHO as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem.

UVEITIS 
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Uveitis: This is caused by an inflammation of the uvea, the vascular layer (middle layer) inside the eye, which causes redness, pain, and vision problems.468
Uveitis is a form of eye inflammation. It affects the middle layer of tissue in the eye wall (uvea).
Uveitis (u-vee-I-tis) warning signs often come on suddenly and get worse quickly. They include eye redness, pain and blurred vision. The condition can affect one or both eyes, and it can affect people of all ages, even children.
Possible causes of uveitis are infection, injury, or an autoimmune or inflammatory disease. Many times a cause can't be identified.
Uveitis can be serious, leading to permanent vision loss. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications and preserve your vision.
Causes
In about half of all cases, the specific cause of uveitis isn't clear, and the disorder may be considered an autoimmune disease that only affects the eye or eyes. If a cause can be determined, it may be one of the following:
An autoimmune or inflammatory disorder that affects other parts of the body, such as sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus or Crohn's disease.
Ankylosing spondylitis, a type of inflammatory disease that can cause some of the bones in the spine to fuse, leading to back pain. Uveitis is one of the most common complications of ankylosing spondylitis.
An infection, such as cat-scratch disease, herpes zoster, syphilis, toxoplasmosis or tuberculosis.
Medication side effects.
Eye injury or surgery.
Very rarely, a cancer that affects the eye, such as lymphoma.

Risk factors
People with changes in certain genes may be more likely to develop uveitis. Cigarette smoking has been associated with more difficult to control uveitis
Symptoms
The signs, symptoms and characteristics of uveitis may include:
Eye redness.
Eye pain.
Light sensitivity.
Blurred vision.
Dark, floating spots in your field of vision (floaters).
Decreased vision.
Symptoms may occur suddenly and get worse quickly, though in some cases, they develop gradually. They may affect one or both eyes. Occasionally, there are no symptoms, and signs of uveitis are observed on a routine eye exam.
The uvea is the middle layer of tissue in the wall of the eye. It consists of the iris, the ciliary body and the choroid. When you look at your eye in the mirror, you will see the white part of the eye (sclera) and the colored part of the eye (iris).
The iris is located inside the front of the eye. The ciliary body is a structure behind the iris. The choroid is a layer of blood vessels between the retina and the sclera. The retina lines the inside of the back of the eye, like wallpaper. The inside of the back of the eye is filled with a gel-like liquid called vitreous.

Eye with uvea
The uvea consists of structures of the eye beneath the white of the eye (sclera). It has three parts: (1) the iris, which is the colored part of the eye; (2) the ciliary body, which is the structure in the eye that secretes the transparent liquid within the front of the eye; and (3) the choroid, which is the layer of blood vessels between the sclera and the retina.
The type of uveitis you have depends on which part or parts of the eye are inflamed:
Anterior uveitis affects the inside of the front of your eye (between the cornea and the iris) and the ciliary body. It is also called iritis and is the most common type of uveitis.
Intermediate uveitis affects the retina and blood vessels just behind the lens (pars plana) as well as the gel in the center of the eye (vitreous).
Posterior uveitis affects a layer on the inside of the back of your eye, either the retina or the choroid.
Panuveitis occurs when all layers of the uvea are inflamed, from the front to the back of your eye.
Diagnosis
When you visit an eye specialist (ophthalmologist), they will likely conduct a complete eye exam and gather a thorough health history. The eye examination usually involves the following:
Assessment of vision (with your glasses if you normally wear them) and the response of your pupils to light.
Tonometry. A tonometry exam measures the pressure inside your eye (intraocular pressure). Numbing eyedrops may be used for this test.
A slit-lamp examination. A slit lamp is a microscope that magnifies and illuminates the front of your eye with an intense line of light. This evaluation is necessary to identify microscopic inflammatory cells in the front of the eye.
Ophthalmoscopy. Also known as funduscopy, this exam involves widening (dilating) the pupil with eye drops and shining a bright light into the eye to examine the back of the eye.
Your doctor also may recommend:
Color photography of the inside of the eye (retina).
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. This test maps the retina and choroid to reveal swelling in these layers.
Fluorescein angiography or indocyanine green angiography. These tests require placement of an intravenous (IV) catheter in a vein in your arm in order to give a dye. This dye will reach the blood vessels in the eyes and allow photographs of swollen blood vessels inside the eyes.
Analysis of aqueous or vitreous fluid from the eye.
Blood tests.
Imaging tests, radiography, Computerized tomography (CT) or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.
If the ophthalmologist thinks an underlying condition may be the cause of your uveitis, you may be referred to another doctor for a general medical examination and laboratory tests.
Sometimes, it's difficult to find a specific cause for uveitis. Even if a specific cause is not identified, uveitis can still be treated successfully. In the majority of cases, identifying a cause for the uveitis does not lead to a cure. It is still necessary to use some form of treatment to control the swelling.

Treatment
If uveitis is caused by an underlying condition, treatment may focus on that specific condition. Usually the treatment for uveitis is the same regardless of the cause, as long as the cause is not infectious. The goal of treatment is to reduce the swelling in your eye, as well as in other parts of the body, if present. In some cases, treatment may be necessary for months to years. Several treatment options are available.
Medications
Drugs that reduce inflammation. Your doctor may first prescribe eye drops with an anti-inflammatory medication, such as a corticosteroid. Eye drops are usually not enough to treat inflammation beyond the front of the eye, so a corticosteroid injection in or around the eye or corticosteroid tablets (taken by mouth) may be necessary.
Drugs that control spasms. Eye drops that widen (dilate) the pupil may be prescribed to control spasms in the iris and ciliary body, which can help relieve eye pain.
Drugs that fight bacteria or viruses. If uveitis is caused by an infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, antiviral medications or other medicines, with or without corticosteroids, to bring the infection under control.
Drugs that affect the immune system or destroy cells. You may need immunosuppressive drugs if your uveitis affects both eyes, doesn't respond well to corticosteroids or becomes severe enough to threaten your vision.
Some of these medicines can have serious eye-related side effects, such as glaucoma and cataracts. Medicine by mouth or injection can have side effects in other parts of the body outside the eyes. You may need to visit your doctor frequently for follow-up examinations and blood tests.
Surgical or other procedures
Vitrectomy. Surgery to remove some of the vitreous in your eye is rarely used to diagnose or manage the condition.
A medication-releasing implant. For people with difficult-to-treat posterior uveitis, a device that's implanted in the eye may be an option. This device slowly releases corticosteroid into the eye for months or years depending on the implant used.
If people have not had cataract surgery, this treatment usually causes cataracts to develop. Also, up to 30% of patients will require treatment or monitoring for elevated eye pressure or glaucoma.
The speed of your recovery depends in part on the type of uveitis you have and how bad your symptoms are. Uveitis that affects the back of your eye (posterior uveitis or panuveitis, including retinitis or choroiditis) tends to heal more slowly than uveitis in the front of the eye (anterior uveitis or iritis). Severe inflammation takes longer to clear up than mild inflammation does.
Uveitis can come back. Make an appointment with your doctor if any of your symptoms reappear or worsen.
Prevention tips
PROGNOSIS
In most cases, the prognosis of uveitis is good assuming early detection and proper treatment.  While a majority of patients will develop an ocular complication, appropriate treatment and surgery, if needed, make permanent vision loss much less likely.. Identifying the underlying cause of uveitis is also important due to significant morbidity and mortality associated with some specific systemic diseases that can cause uveitis.  
Possible complications
Left untreated, uveitis can cause complications, including:
Retinal swelling (macular edema).
Retinal scarring.
Glaucoma.
Cataracts.
Optic nerve damage.
Retinal detachment.
Permanent vision loss.
When to see a doctor / red flag
When to seek medical advice
Contact your doctor if you think you have the warning signs of uveitis. He or she may refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). If you're having significant eye pain and unexpected vision problems, seek immediate medical attention.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
There are several other causes for a painful, red eye with vision changes/loss that are frequently encountered in the primary care and ER setting.  It is important to keep a broad differential when evaluating an eye complaint as there can be significant overlap with a patient's symptoms.  The following causes of a red, painful eye require special skills that must be used in each case to differentiate them.  These special skills include visual acuity testing, IOP measurements, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and fluorescein staining.
Conjunctivitis can present as a painful red eye with photophobia.  Bacterial conjunctivitis can present with purulent discharge which is not present in uveitis.  Patients with viral or allergic conjunctivitis will usually have serous discharge; however, they can also be without discharge. Follicles of the palpebral conjunctiva and the lack of anterior chamber inflammation help make the diagnosis of conjunctivitis.  Chemosis (swelling of the conjunctiva, is also a finding found in conjunctivitis but not in uveitis.
Keratitis is significant inflammation of the cornea. It frequently presents with pain, photophobia, and perilimbic injection  and is most commonly seen in patients with a history of contact lens use.  In keratitis, the cornea is often clouded if not frankly opaque (i.e. corneal ulcer, with ring infiltrate), which is not seen in uveitis.  Also, the pupil is usually normal in shape in keratitis but may be constricted in anterior uveitis due to posterior synechiea formation .  Fluoroscein dye will identify a brightly staining epithelial defect when viewed under a cobalt light, same patient as in 1f with epithelial defect identified by fluorescein dye).  The presence of stromal whitening (corneal infiltrate, that is seen with keratitis is not seen with corneal abrasions.
Acute angle closure glaucoma can present as a painful red eye with a change in vision.  The patient may complain of a unilateral headache and maybe nauseous even to the point of vomiting.  The affected pupil is often mid-dilated and poorly reactive to light.  The IOP will be significantly increased in acute angle closure glaucoma and is typically seen in most causes of uveitis. However, an elevated IOP in the setting of a unilateral anterior uveitis is seen with herpes infections, so a slit lamp examination specifically looking for anterior chamber cell and keratic precipitates (punctate spots on corneal endothelium) should be performed in each case to properly evaluate and treat the patient.  The cornea may also be cloudy due to the acute rise in IOP in angle closure glaucoma.
A corneal abrasion will often cause severe eye pain, photophobia, and tearing. Patients will usually endorse a history of trauma to the affected eye.  A drop of proparacaine at time of evaluation will nearly, if not completely, treat the pain.  This sensitivity to topical anesthesia is not a feature of uveitis of any type.  Examination with fluorescein will identify the abrasion as a brightly staining lesion of the cornea and unless infected, will not likely have a stromal infiltrate/whitening. 
A panuveitis such as seen in acute retinal necrosis from herpes infections and endophthalmitis causes severe inflammation resulting in a red, painful eye.  A hypopyn may be found in the anterior chamber.  As discussed elsewhere, this finding should raise alarm.  A dilated eye exam is required to identify retinal whitening seen in acute retinal necrosis and significant vitritis in endophthalmitis, and as such, likely require an ophthalmology consultation.   If these diagnoses are suspected, an emergent ophthalmology consult should be placed as both are ophthalmic emergencies with earlier treatment resulting in better outcomes.
Most common causes of a red, painful eye:
Anterior uveitis
Keratitis
Corneal abrasion
Acute angle closure glaucoma
Conjunctivitis
Scleritis
Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Uveitis can affect people of all ages and can vary significantly by geographic location and age of the patient .  In a study done from 2006 to 2007, the incidence of uveitis was 24.9 cases per 100,000 persons.  Prevalence rates for 2006 and 2007 came in at 57.5 and 58 respectively per 100,000 persons .  There was no difference in the incidence rate between men and women, but women had a higher prevalence . Anterior uveitis is the most prevalent form, accounting for approximately 50% of uveitis cases, while posterior uveitis is the least common.  Ongoing inflammation seen in untreated uveitis and complications related to this uncontrolled inflammation are estimated to be responsible for approximately 10% of the blindness in the United States.

VAGINITIS
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description
Overview
Vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina that can result in discharge, itching and pain. The cause is usually a change in the balance of vaginal bacteria or an infection. Reduced estrogen levels after menopause and some skin disorders also can cause vaginitis.
The most common types of vaginitis are:
Bacterial vaginosis. This results from an overgrowth of the bacteria naturally found in your vagina, which upsets the natural balance.
Yeast infections. These are usually caused by a naturally occurring fungus called Candida albicans.
Trichomoniasis. This is caused by a parasite and is often sexually transmitted.
Treatment depends on the type of vaginitis you have.
Causes
The cause depends on what type of vaginitis you have:
Bacterial vaginosis. This most common type of vaginitis results from a change of the bacteria found in your vagina, upsetting the balance. What causes the imbalance is unknown. It's possible to have bacterial vaginosis without symptoms.
This type of vaginitis seems to be linked to but not caused by sex — especially if you have multiple sex partners or a new sex partner — but it also occurs in women who aren't sexually active.
Yeast infections. These occur when there's an overgrowth of a fungal organism — usually Candida albicans — in your vagina. C. albicans also causes infections in other moist areas of your body, such as in your mouth (thrush), skin folds and nail beds. The fungus can also cause diaper rash.
Trichomoniasis. This common sexually transmitted infection is caused by a microscopic, one-celled parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. This organism spreads during sex with someone who has the infection.
In men, the organism usually infects the urinary tract, but often it causes no symptoms. In women, trichomoniasis typically infects the vagina, and might cause symptoms. It also increases women's risk of getting other sexually transmitted infections.
Noninfectious vaginitis. Vaginal sprays, douches, perfumed soaps, scented detergents and spermicidal products can cause an allergic reaction or irritate vulvar and vaginal tissues. Foreign objects, such as toilet paper or forgotten tampons, in the vagina also can irritate vaginal tissues.
Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vaginal atrophy). Reduced estrogen levels after menopause or surgical removal of your ovaries can cause the vaginal lining to thin, sometimes resulting in vaginal irritation, burning and dryness.

Risk factors
Factors that increase the risk of developing vaginitis include:
Hormonal changes, such as those associated with pregnancy, birth control pills or menopause
Sexual activity
Having a sexually transmitted infection
Medications, such as antibiotics and steroids
Use of spermicides for birth control
Uncontrolled diabetes
Use of hygiene products such as bubble bath, vaginal spray or vaginal deodorant
Douching
Wearing damp or tight-fitting clothing
Using an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control
Symptoms
Vaginitis signs and symptoms can include:
Change in color, odor or amount of discharge from your vagina
Vaginal itching or irritation
Pain during sex
Painful urination
Light vaginal bleeding or spotting
If you have vaginal discharge, the characteristics of the discharge might indicate the type of vaginitis you have. Examples include:
Bacterial vaginosis. You might develop a grayish-white, foul-smelling discharge. The odor, often described as a fishy odor, might be more obvious after sex.
Yeast infection. The main symptom is itching, but you might have a thick white discharge that resembles cottage cheese.
Trichomoniasis. An infection called trichomoniasis (trik-o-moe-NIE-uh-sis) can cause a greenish-yellow, sometimes frothy discharge.
Diagnosis
To diagnose vaginitis, your health care provider is likely to:
Review your medical history. This includes your history of vaginal or sexually transmitted infections.
Perform a pelvic exam. During the pelvic exam, your health care provider might use an instrument (speculum) to look inside your vagina for inflammation and discharge.
Collect a sample for lab testing. Your health care provider might collect a sample of cervical or vaginal discharge for lab testing to confirm what kind of vaginitis you have.
Perform pH testing. Your health care provider might test your vaginal pH by applying a pH test stick or pH paper to the wall of your vagina. An elevated pH can indicate either bacteria vaginosis or trichomoniasis. However, pH testing alone is not a reliable diagnostic test.

Treatment
A variety of organisms and conditions can cause vaginitis, so treatment targets the specific cause:
Bacterial vaginosis. For this type of vaginitis, your health care provider might prescribe metronidazole tablets (Flagyl) that you take by mouth or metronidazole gel (MetroGel) that you apply to the affected area. Other treatments include clindamycin (Cleocin) cream that you apply to your vagina, clindamycin tablets you take by mouth or capsules you put in your vagina. Tinidazole (Tindamax) or secnidazole (Solosec) are taken by mouth.
Bacterial vaginosis can recur after treatment.
Yeast infections. Yeast infections usually are treated with an over-the-counter antifungal cream or suppository, such as miconazole (Monistat 1), clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF, Mycelex, Trivagizole 3), butoconazole (Gynazole-1) or tioconazole (Vagistat-1). Yeast infections might also be treated with a prescription oral antifungal medication, such as fluconazole (Diflucan).
The advantages of over-the-counter treatment are convenience, cost and not waiting to see your health care provider. However, you might have something other than a yeast infection. Using the wrong medicine might delay an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment.
Trichomoniasis. Your health care provider may prescribe metronidazole (Flagyl) or tinidazole (Tindamax) tablets.
Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vaginal atrophy). Estrogen — in the form of vaginal creams, tablets or rings — can treat this condition. This treatment is available by prescription from your health care provider, after other risk factors and possible complications are reviewed.
Noninfectious vaginitis. To treat this type of vaginitis, you need to pinpoint the source of the irritation and avoid it. Possible sources include new soap, laundry detergent, sanitary napkins or tampons.
Self care
You'll need prescription medication to treat trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis and vaginal atrophy. If you know you have a yeast infection, you can take these steps:
Use a medication specifically for yeast infections that you can get without a prescription. Options include one-day, three-day or seven-day courses of cream or vaginal suppositories. The active ingredient varies, depending on the product: clotrimazole, miconazole (Monistat 1) or tioconazole (Vagistat).
Some products also come with an external cream to apply to the labia and opening of the vagina. Follow package directions and complete the entire course of treatment, even if you're feeling better right away.
Apply a cold compress, such as a washcloth, to the labial area to ease discomfort until the antifungal medication takes full effect
Prevention
Good hygiene might prevent some types of vaginitis from recurring and relieve some symptoms:
Avoid baths, hot tubs and whirlpool spas.
Avoid irritants. These include scented tampons, pads, douches and scented soaps. Rinse soap from your outer genital area after a shower and dry the area well to prevent irritation. Don't use harsh soaps, such as those with deodorant or antibacterial action, or bubble bath.
Wipe from front to back after using the toilet. Doing so avoids spreading fecal bacteria to your vagina.
Other things that might help prevent vaginitis include:
Avoid douching. Your vagina doesn't require cleansing other than regular showering. Repetitive douching disrupts the good organisms that live in the vagina and can increase your risk of vaginal infection. Douching won't clear up a vaginal infection.
Practice safer sex. Using a condom and limiting the number of sex partners can help.
Wear cotton underwear. Also wear pantyhose with a cotton crotch. Consider not wearing underwear to bed. Yeast thrives in moist environments.
Prognosis
In most women, vaginitis has an excellent outcome, and a cure is likely. Most cases of vaginitis, including bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, and trichomoniasis, respond well to medication, such as antibiotics or antifungals, depending on the underlying cause. However, recurrence is common and can lead to excoriations, chronic irritation, and scarring. In addition, these symptoms also lead to low libido and a decline in sexual function. Both emotional stress and psychosocial issues are not uncommon. Certain risk factors, such as immunocompromised conditions or repeated irritant exposure, may affect the prognosis and recurrence. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are crucial for achieving a favorable prognosis and preventing complications.
Atrophic vaginitis as part of genitourinary syndrome of menopause affects up to 77% of women, worsens over time, and persists lifelong. Local therapies, as discussed, improve symptom severity by up to 80%, and the prognosis is excellent with continued treatment.
Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, however, is a chronic process that is difficult to diagnose and does not respond well to currently known therapies. The cure rate is under 35% at 2 years. Relapse is common, and continued therapy may be needed in over 50% of affected women.
Complications
Women with trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis are at a greater risk of getting sexually transmitted infections because of the inflammation caused by these disorders.
When to see a doctor
See your health care provider if you develop vaginal discomfort, especially if:
You have a particularly unpleasant vaginal odor, discharge or itching.
You've never had a vaginal infection. Seeing your health care provider can establish the cause and help you learn to identify the signs and symptoms.
You've had vaginal infections before.
You've had multiple sex partners or a recent new partner. You could have a sexually transmitted infection, some of which have signs and symptoms similar to those of a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis.
You've completed a course of over-the-counter anti-yeast medication and your symptoms persist.
You have a fever, chills or pelvic pain.
Wait-and-see approach
You probably don't need to see your health care provider every time you have vaginal irritation and discharge, particularly if:
You've previously had a diagnosis of vaginal yeast infection and your signs and symptoms are the same as before
You know the signs and symptoms of a yeast infection, and you're confident that's what you have
Differential Diagnosis
When evaluating a patient with vaginitis symptoms, it is crucial to consider a wide range of differential diagnoses. The following list encompasses various conditions that can mimic vaginitis. These differential diagnoses help ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
Sexually Transmitted Infections 
Chlamydia and gonorrhea: These infections can cause vaginal discharge, irritation, and discomfort similar to vaginitis.
Herpes simplex virus: Genital herpes can cause pain, itching, and vesicles, which might be mistaken for vaginitis.
Human papillomavirus: Some strains cause genital warts and changes in vaginal discharge.
Urinary Tract Infections 
Urinary tract infections can cause burning, urgency, and frequency of urination, which may be confused with the symptoms of vaginitis.
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Pelvic inflammatory disease can cause lower abdominal pain, fever, and unusual vaginal discharge, overlapping with vaginitis symptoms.
Dermatologic Conditions
Lichen sclerosus and lichen planus: These chronic skin conditions can cause itching, discomfort, and changes in the vulvar skin that may be mistaken for vaginitis.
Eczema and psoriasis: These entities can cause irritation and itching in the genital area.
Vulvodynia: Chronic pain or discomfort around the vulva can be mistaken for the discomfort associated with vaginitis.
Allergic reactions to products such as soaps, detergents, or feminine hygiene products can cause irritation and discharge similar to vaginitis.
Foreign Bodies
Retained tampons or other foreign objects can cause vaginal discharge, odor, irritation, and infection.

Recent guidelines or updates (e.g., from WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
Recommended Regimens According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Bacterial vaginosis:
Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days
Metronidazole gel 0.75%, 1 full applicator (5 g) intravaginally, once daily for 5 days
Clindamycin cream 2%, 1 full applicator (5 g) intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days 
Alternative regimens for bacterial vaginosis:
Tinidazole 2 g orally once daily for 2 days
Tinidazole 1 g orally once daily for 5 days
Secnidazole 2 g orally as a single dose
Clindamycin 300 mg orally twice daily for 7 days
Clindamycin ovules 100 mg intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days
Patients are no longer advised to abstain from alcohol use during treatment with metronidazole, as the disulfiram-like reaction has not been supported by evidence. Approximately 80% to 90% cure rates are expected 1 week after treatment. No routine follow-up is necessary for the asymptomatic patient after treatment, although 30% recur at 3 months or later. With recurrent disease, defined as 3 episodes in 1 year or 2 episodes in 6 months, the first step is to confirm the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis again. For recurrence, women can be treated with the same regimen again or use an alternative regimen. Multiple recurrences after completion of a recommended regimen can be treated with 0.75% metronidazole gel twice weekly for 3 months. Although this has been shown to reduce recurrences, the benefit does not persist when suppressive therapy is discontinued. Another option for persistent or recurrent disease that is not FDA-approved is an oral nitroimidazole followed by intravaginal boric acid 600 mg daily for 14 to 21 days and then suppressive 0.75% metronidazole gel twice weekly for 4 to 6 months.
The CDC does not recommend oral or vaginal probiotics. Although vaginally delivered L crispatus may be a potential option, it is not FDA-approved. Condom use during treatment can be considered, though treating male partners is generally not advised. Topical clindamycin for male partners may hold promise, and treating symptomatic female partners is a reasonable approach.
Trichomoniasis:
Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice per day for 7 days
Alternatively,
Tinidazole 2 gm orally once
Metronidazole 2 gm orally once
Secnidazole 2 gm orally once
Nitroimidazoles are the only class of antimicrobial medications effective against T vaginalis infections. The United States FDA cleared metronidazole and tinidazole for the oral or parenteral treatment of trichomoniasis. Metronidazole gel does not reach therapeutic levels in the urethra, vagina, and paravaginal glands and is not recommended for the treatment of trichomoniasis. Tinidazole is avoided during pregnancy and contraindicated in the first trimester. The recommended metronidazole regimens have cure rates of approximately 84% to 98%, and the tinidazole regimen has rates of approximately 92% to 100%. Metronidazole resistance occurs in 4% to 10% of cases of vaginal trichomoniasis, and tinidazole resistance in 1%, but most cases of persistent infection are from reinfection. If routine treatment regimens fail, referral to an infectious disease specialist and susceptibility testing should be considered.
The CDC treatment guidelines changed in 2021, and now trichomoniasis is the first STI for which the recommended treatment varies by anatomical sex. This change was based on an efficacy of 81% compared with 89% with the longer course of metronidazole in women. Any sexual partner in the 90 days before diagnosis should also be treated. For male partners, a single dose of metronidazole is still first-line, and condom use is recommended until all partners have been treated. The CDC does recommend a test of cure in 3 months.
Yeast vulvovaginitis: Yeast vulvovaginitis is often secondary to C albicans, but less common pathogens include C glabrata, C parapsilosis, C tropicalis, and C krusei. Although Candida is a standard component of the vagina, risk factors for pathogenic overgrowth include antibiotic use, combination oral contraceptives, estrogen therapy, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid use, and all forms of immune compromise. The infection is most common during the childbearing years when estrogen is plentiful. Glycogen is key to facilitating Candida growth and adherence. Signs and symptoms of yeast vulvovaginitis include genital burning, pruritis, dyspareunia, dysuria, and a thick, white, curd-like discharge. The wet prep is 60% to 70% sensitive to yeast vaginitis. Budding yeasts, pseudohyphae, large numbers of WBCs, lactobacilli, and clumps of epithelial cells are observed on the wet mount. The pH is <4.5, and the amine whiff test is negative. A yeast culture is rarely needed but can be ordered if non-C albicans species are suspected. C glabrata does not form pseudohyphae and is difficult to recognize on microscopy. DNA testing is also available to identify species.
Uncomplicated candida vaginitis: For uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, a short course (1- or 3-day course) of over-the-counter topical antifungals, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, tioconazole, butoconazole, and itraconazole, results in cure rates of 80% to 90%. A single oral dose of fluconazole 150 mg is also effective; however, fluconazole should not be used at any time during pregnancy or in possibly pregnant patients, due to the increased risk of spontaneous abortion and potentially other complications. If the symptoms resolve, no follow-up is needed. There are no behavioral interventions, including changing contraceptive methods, that are supported by good data to reduce candidiasis infections.
Complicated candida vaginitis: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis is defined as 2 episodes in 6 months or 3 episodes over 1 year. Treatment for recurrent candidiasis includes a course of 7 to 14 days of topical therapy, or a 100, 150, or 200 mg oral dose of fluconazole every third day for 3 doses (days 1, 4, and 7) can be used. The first-line maintenance regimen is oral fluconazole at dosages 100, 150, or 200 mg weekly for 6 months. Approximately 30% to 50% of women have recurrent disease after maintenance therapy is discontinued.
Severe candidiasis: A 7- to 14-day topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in 2 sequential oral doses 72 hours apart is often effective.
Non-C albicans candidiasis: A 7- to 14-day regimen of a non-fluconazole azole (oral or topical) as first-line therapy can be prescribed. If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric acid in a gelatin capsule is recommended, administered vaginally once daily for 2 weeks.
Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis: Treatment involves topical steroids to reduce inflammation, although randomized trials have not been completed. If bacterial overgrowth is suspected, clindamycin or other antibiotics may be prescribed. Initial therapy with 2% clindamycin cream vaginally every other night for 2 weeks can be tried. Alternatively, 100 mg hydrocortisone suppositories nightly for 3 weeks are suggested. Prolonged therapy with once- or twice-weekly medications for up to 2 months may be needed. Topical estrogen therapy can be beneficial, particularly in postmenopausal women. Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis can be a chronic condition that requires long-term management. Patients may experience periods of relapse and remission. Regular follow-up with a healthcare professional is essential for managing symptoms and adjusting treatment.
Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (atrophic vaginitis): Many women do not seek evaluation or therapy for atrophic vaginitis, although it can significantly affect sexual health and quality of life. This condition is initially treated with lubricant use during intercourse and personal vaginal moisturizers. If these remedies do not give satisfactory results, then local vaginal estrogen therapy using a cream, suppository, or vaginal ring (7.5 μg dose) can be used. Intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone is also an available treatment.  Vaginal treatment with radiofrequency and lasers is not recommended due to lack of efficacy studies.  More recently, a selective estrogen receptor agonist called ospemifene has been approved for use in patients with vulvovaginal atrophy of menopause; this medication is taken once daily by mouth at a dose of 60 mg. This medicine is an estrogen agonist in the vulvovaginal tissue and specifically promotes epithelial lining proliferation in this tissue.
Mixed vaginitis: Mixed vaginitis is challenging to treat, and standard treatment regimens have not been established. Recurrence is common. Each pathogen requires treatment for complete eradication of vaginitis that is caused by two or more vaginal pathogens. Several small clinical studies have shown the efficacy and safety of topical fenticonazole as a treatment for mixed bacterial and fungal vaginitis as an alternative to multiagent treatment regimens.
Negative tests: If initial testing is negative, retesting during heightened symptoms may be appropriate. Patients should avoid self-treatment for at least 2 weeks before undergoing testing. Further evaluation may include allergy testing or biopsy if indicated. Reassurance can be provided, with the option to retest if symptoms worsen or recur.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Vaginitis is a highly prevalent global condition that affects millions of women annually. Bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause, accounting for 40% to 50% of cases, followed by yeast infections, which affect about 20% to 25% of women at least once in their lifetime. Trichomoniasis, an STI, impacts approximately 8 million women annually in the United States.
The prevalence of vaginitis varies with age, sexual activity, and hormonal status, with an increased incidence noted in reproductive-aged women and during periods of hormonal change, such as pregnancy and menopause. The normal vaginal flora is constantly changing and is influenced by many physiological and environmental factors. Socioeconomic factors, hygiene practices, and access to health care also influence the incidence and management of vaginitis. Approximately 8% to 18% of women report symptoms such as vaginal discharge, odor, pruritus, and discomfort yearly. Furthermore, 55% to 83% of women consult a healthcare professional when the symptoms occur, but most patients use over-the-counter antifungals as home therapy.
Bacterial Vaginosis
In reproductive-aged women, bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of vaginitis. This condition is caused by a shift in normal vaginal flora, with lactobacilli being replaced by anaerobic bacteria. Because bacterial vaginosis is not an inflammatory condition, erythema, fissuring, and bleeding may not be present on physical examination. Bacterial overgrowth of G vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Mobiluncus spp., Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. may be present. Symptoms include foul-smelling discharge, irritation around and outside the vaginal introitus, and, sometimes, burning with urination. Please see StatPearls' companion reference, "Bacterial Vaginosis," for more information.
Vaginal Candidiasis
Candida vaginitis is caused by the overgrowth of Candida fungi, affecting 75% of women in their lifetimes. Candida infection is the next most common type of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis, with 55% of women experiencing an infection by age 25. Approximately 9% of women report four or more episodes annually. Please see StatPearls' companion reference, "Vaginal Candidiasis," for more information.
Trichomoniasis
Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan parasite responsible for causing trichomoniasis, the most common non viral STI worldwide. Over 1 million people in the United States are affected by this parasite annually. The global incidence of trichomoniasis infections is reported at 153 million cases. Age, race, income, socioeconomic factors, and education level contribute to the epidemiology of trichomoniasis globally.
Desquamative Inflammatory Vaginitis 
The exact cause of desquamative inflammatory vaginitis is not well understood, but it involves significant inflammation of the vaginal epithelium. This infrequent, noninfectious, chronic inflammatory condition is more common in White women. There may be an imbalance in the normal vaginal flora, with a significant decrease in Lactobacillus species and an overgrowth of other facultative anaerobic bacteria, resulting in an elevated vaginal pH. Signs and symptoms of desquamative inflammatory vaginitis include profuse, copious, purulent vaginal discharge, often yellow or greenish and sometimes mixed with blood. Additional findings may include intense itching and burning sensation or even pain in the vulvovaginal area, redness and swelling of the vulvovaginal tissues, and dyspareunia. 
Atrophic Vaginitis
Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is the new term for vulvovaginal atrophy, a condition that affects a significant percentage of menopausal women. Signs and symptoms of atrophic vaginitis include vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, vaginal inflammation, burning, thin vaginal mucosa, loss of rugae, and, occasionally, purulent discharge. Wet mount microscopy of the vaginal discharge shows many white blood cells (WBCs), occasional parabasal and basal cells, decreased lactobacilli, and increased gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. Vaginal pH is frequently >4.5.
Cytolytic Vaginitis
There is insufficient evidence to validate cytolytic vaginitis as a clinical entity, although this entity has been described since 1991. This type of vaginitis is associated with vaginal acidity that causes irritation and discharge due to high concentrations of Lactobacillus species.
Mixed Vaginitis
Mixed vaginitis is the presence of two or more types of vaginal pathogens simultaneously. Symptoms may be atypical, and treatment is more complicated than vaginitis from a single source. Mixed vaginitis has not been well-studied. A literature review revealed that the prevalence of mixed vaginitis varies widely, ranging from slightly over 4% to approximately 35%. Most commonly, bacterial vaginosis and candida are considered. However, study results have shown that the 3 most common types of mixed vaginitis include desquamative inflammatory vaginitis/atrophic vaginitis/bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis plus desquamative inflammatory vaginitis/atrophic vaginitis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis plus bacterial vaginosis.
Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma 
Neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nor the European STI guidelines advise conducting testing for Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma, as they have not been definitively linked to vaginitis and are typically associated only with their frequent co-occurrence with bacterial vaginosis. M genitalium may be an exception, as it can be associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and cervicitis, but testing for this should be reserved for recurrent or refractory cases.
Effective treatment of vaginitis requires a targeted approach based on the specific underlying cause. The various therapeutic options tailored to manage and resolve different types of vaginitis are outlined.

VITREOMACULAR TRACTION SYNDROME
Name of the illness (both medical and common names, if applicable)
Definition and description 

The vitreous humor is a transparent, gel-like material that fills the space within the eye between the lens and the retina. The vitreous is encapsulated in a thin shell called the vitreous cortex, and the cortex in young, healthy eyes is usually sealed to the retina.
As the eye ages, or in certain pathologic conditions, the vitreous cortex can pull away from the retina, leading to a condition known as posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). This detachment usually occurs as part of the normal aging process.
There are instances where a PVD is incomplete, leaving the vitreous partially attached to the retina, and causing tractional (pulling) forces that can cause anatomical damage. The resulting condition is called vitreomacular traction (VMT) syndrome.
VMT syndrome can lead to different maculopathies or disorders in the macular area (at the center of the retina), such as full- or partial-thickness macular holes, epiretinal membranes, and cystoid macular edema. These disorders are often associated with reduced sharpness of vision (visual acuity) or other visual complications.
Symptoms in detail
The most common symptoms experienced by patients with VMT syndrome are: 
Decreased sharpness of vision
Photopsia, when a person sees flashes of light in the eye
Micropsia, when objects appear smaller than their actual size
Metamorphopsia, when vision is distorted to make a grid of straight lines appear wavy or blank
Some of these symptoms can be mild and develop slowly; however, chronic tractional effects can lead to continued visual loss if left untreated. In some cases, a distortion of a visual picture could be experienced without necessarily having a reduction in sharpness of vision.

Causes
Age-related degeneration of the gel-like vitreous humor leads to the formation of pockets of fluid within the vitreous, causing contraction and loss of volume. The separation of the vitreous gel from the retina occurs as a result of the gel becoming liquid (liquefaction) and the continuous anterior-posterior (front-back) and tractional forces stretching on the macula over time.
Weakening of the attachments of the vitreous cortex and the internal limiting membrane (ILM) of the retina could also lead to partial detachment of the posterior hyaloid membrane, leading to PVD and potentially VMT.
Risk factors
VMT syndrome is most common in older adults and women due to age-related vitreous changes and vitreous liquefaction associated with declining post-menopausal estrogen levels, respectively. 
Other risk factors include:
High myopia (extreme nearsightedness)
Exudative (wet) age-related macular degeneration
Diabetic macular edema
Retinal vein occlusion
Diabetic retinopathy

Diagnostic testing
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a commonly used and recommended method to noninvasively identify and monitor VMT syndrome. This technology captures cross-sectional images of the retinal layers, including the surface, and allows physicians to evaluate the degree to which vitreomacular tractional forces are distorting the retinal structure.
A dynamic B-scan ultrasound examination could also be performed to provide a detailed evaluation of the vitreoretinal interface.
Treatment and prognosis
There are currently 4 main options for treating VMT syndrome.
Watchful waiting and regular monitoring with OCT is often used for patients whose symptoms do not warrant active intervention. Some cases of VMT may spontaneously resolve.
For patients whose symptoms are severe enough to require intervention, pars plana vitrectomy surgery is one treatment option. The procedure involves the manual release of vitreous attachment and alleviation of traction, but it is invasive and inconvenient to most patients. Therefore vitrectomy is reserved for patients who are at risk for severe visual disturbances and/or central blindness. Some studies have shown that shorter duration of symptoms results in better prognosis when the surgical treatment is employed.
Ocriplasmin (Jetrea®), a recombinant truncated form of human plasmin, is a pharmacologic option for treating VMT syndrome. Clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a single intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin for the treatment of patients with symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion, and/or vitreomacular traction. Ocriplasmin is therefore a treatment option for some patients who have vitreomacular traction but who are not candidates for surgery.
Pneumatic vitreolysis - a small gas bubble is injected into the eye in the office. Afterward, the patient will look down several times per hour for a day or two to try to get the gas bubble to sever the adhesion between the vitreous and the macula. 
Most patients with VMT maintain good visual acuity in the affected eye, even if treatment is required.Prevention tips

KEYWORDS: Ophthalmology, Ophthalmology definition, diseases under ophthalmology, disease that affect the eye and visuals in alphabetical order, 
Ophthalmologists are medical doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of eye and vision problems. What is the difference between an ophthalmologist and an optometrist, then? What about opticians? These three types of eye care specialists have rather similar-sounding names and overlapping job descriptions. It can be confusing at first glance. Here’s the difference:
Opticians can help you choose frames for your glasses and provide information about types of lenses and lens coatings. They cannot give eye exams, write prescriptions, or diagnose or treat eye problems.
Optometrists can examine your eyes, test your vision, prescribe glasses or contacts, and diagnose and treat many eye disorders and diseases. They are not medical doctors or surgeons but can prescribe certain eye-related medications. 
Ophthalmologists also provide eye exams, vision testing, and prescriptions for glasses or contact lenses. As medical doctors, they can diagnose and treat any and all eye problems. They can perform eye surgery and provide follow-up care.
