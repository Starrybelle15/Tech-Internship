DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Aerodigestive Disorders Aerodigestive disorders are conditions or diseases of the aerodigestive tract—including the airway (pharynx and larynx), pulmonary tract (trachea, bronchi, and lungs), and upper digestive tract (esophagus)—that may affect respiratory and swallowing functions. Aerodigestive disorders, or the management of them (e.g. surgery, intubation), may result in voice, feeding, and/or swallowing problems as well as laryngeal airway problems—the term used in this Practice Portal page to refer to paradoxical vocal fold movement (PVFM) and chronic cough. Aerodigestive disorders may be congenital, developmental, or acquired. They are not mutually exclusive individuals may have more than one disorder. In children, some aerodigestive disorders may resolve with maturity or with behavioral management, but others may require medical and/or surgical intervention. Q: EXAMPLES OF AERODIGESTIVE DISORDERS Examples of common aerodigestive disorders (grouped by anatomical location) include, but are not limited to, the following: Airway (Pharynx and Larynx) Chronic cough Dystussia Epiglottitis Fungal infections of the pharynx or the larynx (e.g., blastomycosis [rare], histoplasmosis, candidiasis) Irritable larynx Laryngeal clefts Laryngeal or pharyngeal paralysis/paresis (unilateral or bilateral) Laryngeal stenosis (supraglottic, glottic, or subglottic) Laryngeal webs Laryngomalacia (moderate to severe) Laryngopharyngeal reflux Laryngospasm Muscle tension dysphagia Muscle tension dysphonia PVFM (Paradoxical Vocal Fold Motion) Breathing–swallowing incoordination (secondary to medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neurological insult, or head and neck cancer) Structural or physiologic changes secondary to injury, neoplasms, radiation therapy, or surgery (e.g., pharyngeal or laryngeal resections, radiation for head and neck cancer treatment, prolonged intubation) Velopharyngeal dysfunction Pulmonary Tract (Trachea, Bronchi, and Lungs) Bronchomalacia Chronic lung disease (e.g., asthma, emphysema, COPD) Infectious diseases affecting pulmonary function (e.g., upper respiratory infection, pertussis [whooping cough], pneumonia, tuberculosis) Neoplasms Structural or physiologic changes affecting pulmonary function secondary to injury or surgery (e.g., pneumothorax [collapsed lung], pneumonectomy, lung transplantation) Tracheal stenosis Tracheoesophageal fistula Tracheomalacia Upper Digestive Tract (Esophagus) Esophageal motility disorder, including spasm and achalasia Esophageal structural disorder, including stricture, web, diverticulum, and ring Gastroesophageal reflux Inflammatory forms of esophagitis (e.g., eosinophilic, viral, reflux-related) Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) Involvement in Aerodigestive Disorders Aerodigestive disorders can cause secondary problems in feeding, swallowing, voice, and/or laryngeal airway function. SLPs play a role in the screening, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of these secondary problems and often work collaboratively with other professionals in providing services to individuals with aerodigestive disorders. Q: Paradoxical Vocal Fold Movement (PVFM) Paradoxical vocal fold movement, or PVFM, is the intermittent, episodic adduction of the vocal folds during inspiration. During episodes, the vocal folds adduct partially or fully and restrict the passage of air to the lungs. PVFM can occur in isolation, or it can co-occur with other conditions, including pulmonary disorders (e.g., asthma), laryngeal abnormalities, and cardiac pathology Paradoxical vocal fold movement (PVFM) has been associated with chronic cough and asthma. True prevalence of PVFM is unknown due to inconsistent diagnostic criteria and a lack of awareness of the disorder. However, studies have reported PVFM as a subset of the investigated clinical population. For example, PVFM was estimated to occur in 2.5%–22% of emergency room patients presenting with shortness of breath or asthma. Across the life span, reports estimated that PVFM is more common in females than in males, with a ratio ranging from 2:1 to 3:1. Increased rates of PVFM were reported in elite athletes), in individuals with elevated stress, and in individuals exposed to irritants (e.g., reflux, allergens; Q: Chronic Cough Chronic cough is most commonly defined as a cough lasting more than 8 weeks in adults and more than 4 weeks in children. Chronic cough may be termed “somatic cough syndrome” in the absence of a known cause or “tic cough” when it is accompanied by core clinical features of tics (e.g., suppressibility, distractibility, suggestibility, variability, and presence of a warning sensation; . SLP intervention is an effective treatment for chronic cough and addresses the management of cough regardless of the initiating cause. Q: Incidence and Prevalence The incidence of a disorder or condition refers to the number of new cases identified in a specified time period. Prevalence refers to the number of individuals who are living with the disorder or condition in a given time period. The following aerodigestive disorders provide a sample of conditions that can cause feeding, swallowing, voice, and/or laryngeal airway problems that may involve treatment by a speech-language pathologist (SLP). Some problems may be symptomatic or indicative of an aerodigestive disorder but do not involve treatment by an SLP. For example, dysphagia symptoms in individuals with esophageal dysmotility may resolve following medical and/or surgical intervention. Q: Airway Disorders Laryngeal cleft occurs in 1 out of 10,000–20,000 infants, with slightly higher rates noted in males with a ratio ranging from 1.2:1.0 to 1.8:1.0 . Approximately 41% of patients with laryngeal cleft were found to silently aspirate Laryngomalacia was estimated to affect approximately 1 in 2,600–3,100 newborns, and stridor was a reported symptom in the majority of children in the study. Estimates reported dysphagia to be present in 41%–50% of patients with laryngomalacia. Q: Pulmonary Tract Disorders Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was self-reported by 15.5 million adults in the United States (40.3 cases per 100,000 individuals). Higher prevalence was reported in rural areas An increase in compromised swallowing function was reported for adults with COPD over 60 years of age. Q: Upper Digestive Tract Disorders Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is associated with many aerodigestive disorders, including, but not limited to, laryngeal cleft, esophageal atresia, and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Estimates of GERD in individuals with esophageal disorders ranged from 40.2% to 65.3% of patients. Voice disorders and dysphagia may also be associated with GERD. Voice disorders are reported to be 1.8 times higher in patients with GERD Esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula was estimated to affect 2.3 out of 100,000 live births in 2017. Prevalence rates of long-term dysphagia in individuals with esophageal atresia ranged from 18.2% to 84.2%. Prevalence of dysphagia decreases as children get older, but dysphagia has been commonly indicated in adults who had esophageal atresia repair as children. Q: Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) was estimated to affect 71.1 out of 100,000 children and 25.9–55.5 out of 100,000 adults, with a prevalence rate significantly higher in adult men than in adult women (35.8 vs. 17.8 out of 100,000 persons, respectively). Relative to other races and ethnicities, EoE was highest in Caucasians. EoE was estimated to affect 18.6 out of 100,000 elderly persons . Patients with EoE reported dysphagia as a common symptom. Dysphagia was reported in 46.2%–94.5% of adults. Estimates reported that 4.8%–60.9% of children with EoE experience dysphagia and globus sensation, but estimates may be as high as 88% . Voice and swallowing problems commonly occur as a result of structural or physiologic changes to the aerodigestive tract secondary to surgery or radiation therapy. For example, the majority of individuals (70.5%) who received a lung transplant and subsequent swallowing evaluation showed laryngeal penetration or aspiration . Q: SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF AEROF=DIGESTIVE DISORDERS Signs are observations made by a third party (e.g., clinician or family member). For example, observations of coughing when someone swallows may be a sign of aspiration, and observations of changes in someone\\'s vocal pitch may be a sign that the vocal folds are swollen or inflamed. Symptoms are a person\\'s own perception of changes in their swallowing, voice, breathing, or desire to eat or drink. Symptoms are usually described in terms of severity, location, frequency, and duration. For example, a person may notice that, recently, they have been coughing a great deal following exercise. Signs and symptoms of aerodigestive disorders can vary depending on the specific disorder and the severity of the condition causing the disorder. The following signs and symptoms are grouped by the function that can be affected: FEEDING AND SWALLOWING aversion, disinterest, or refusal behaviors surrounding eating or drinking avoidance of certain foods and/or food characteristics avoidance of eating and drinking in public coughing or choking during or after eating globus sensation (feeling of something stuck in the pharynx) increased duration of feeding and/or mealtimes increased swallowing effort odynophagia (painful swallowing) pharyngonasal backflow (often referred to as “nasopharyngeal reflux”) poor weight gain in infants and children recurrent pulmonary infections, such as pneumonia regurgitation of swallowed food back into the pharynx or into the oral or nasal cavity slow or uncoordinated feeding in infants and children throat clearing during or after eating unexplained weight loss in adults or children wet breath sounds or wet vocal quality during or after eating 2. Voice aphonia (no voicing) breathiness increased vocal effort pain while voicing (odynophonia) rough vocal quality strained vocal quality vocal fatigue vocal pitch changes (e.g., in response to inflammation and edema) weak or inadequate vocal volume Respiration 3. Chronic cough disco ordinated or weak voluntary cough excessive mucous secretion excessive sputum production inability to manage oral and/or pharyngeal secretions independently increased effort of breathing overwhelming need to want to “take a breath” pneumonia rapid respiratory rate recurrent respiratory infections stridor (secondary to vocal fold paralysis or other airway obstruction; inspiratory or biphasic) weak reflexive cough wheezing productive (wet) or nonproductive (dry) cough cough lasting more than 8 weeks in adults and more than 4 weeks in children 4. Paradoxical Vocal Fold Movement (PVFM) cough and rough vocal quality before or during an episode of vocal fold adduction difficulty inhaling, exhaling, or both (sole report of difficulty exhaling suggests asthma) lightheadedness that resolves quickly when trigger is removed stridor on inhalation (stridor for both inhalation and exhalation suggests laryngeal obstruction) sudden adduction of the vocal folds induced by triggering stimuli, such as activity, stress, or environmental irritants sudden and total loss of voice tightness in the throat Q: CAUSES OF AERODIGESTIVE DISORDERS There are many ways to categorize the causes of aerodigestive disorders, given the overlap of structures and functions involved. This Practice Portal page uses the following categories: Congenital: embryologic origins, including incomplete or atypical development, innervation, structure, and function of the aerodigestive tract structures 2. Structural/Anatomical: injury or surgery affecting airway, pulmonary, or digestive structure and function weakness or dysfunction of the upper esophageal sphincter, allowing for regurgitation of acidic content into the pharynx, larynx, or nasal airway weakness or dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter, allowing acidic stomach contents to reenter the esophagus 3. Functional: emotional stressors, fear, and/or anxiety that contribute to increased muscle tension environmental irritants or exercise laryngeal hyperreactivity laryngotracheal hypo reactivity 4. Other Medical Conditions autonomic dysfunction (e.g., diabetic neuropathy, vasovagal syncope) cardiovascular, pulmonary, or neurological diseases, or cancer, leading to breathing–swallowing incoordination (e.g., congenital heart defects, meconium aspiration syndrome, chronic lung disease, cystic fibrosis, head and neck cancer, motor neuron disease) irregular, unsynchronized, inappropriate, or absent esophageal contractions causing motility problems neurological diseases affecting aerodigestive sensorimotor function (e.g., stroke, Parkinson\\'s disease, prematurity, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, myopathies) neurological problems that trigger coughing, laryngospasm, bronchial constriction, or long-term bronchial changes affecting lung function recovery from respiratory failure or aerodigestive disuse during periods of critical care due to the use of artificial airways Paradoxical Vocal Fold Movement (PVFM) The exact cause of PVFM is not known, although PVFM may be related to laryngeal hyperresponsiveness. Q: TRIGGERS OF PVFM PVFM may be triggered by organic factors, such as gastroesophageal reflux or environmental irritants, or nonorganic factors, such as exercise or psychological stress. Q: TRIGGERS OF CHRONIC COUGH Chronic Cough may be triggered by asthma syndrome esophageal diseases, such as gastroesophageal reflux idiopathic heightened cough response, particularly in females rhinitis and sinusitis postnasal drip use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (medications for the treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure) Assessment and treatment of aerodigestive disorders may require use of appropriate personal protective equipment. Most aerodigestive disorders are identified by a physician on the basis of physical examination and one or more of the following: gastrointestinal evaluation (e.g., esophageal motility study; gastric emptying test; esophagogastroduodenoscopy; esophagram; esophageal manometry; 24-hour pH or impedance test; Raman spectroscopy) instrumental examinations (e.g., endoscopy; videofluoroscopy; airway fluoroscopy; flexible bronchoscopy; bronchoalveolar lavage; direct microlaryngoscopy; high-resolution pharyngeal manometry) PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS X-ray and other imaging studies (e.g., chest X-ray; chest computed tomography scan; magnetic resonance imaging; electromyography; ultrasound) Assessment of impairments caused by aerodigestive disorders often requires a multidisciplinary approach involving the speech-language pathologist (SLP) and other medical, surgical, and rehabilitation specialists. In collaboration with other health care specialists, the SLP provides expertise on feeding, swallowing, voice, and laryngeal airway problems related to aerodigestive disorders. A multidisciplinary approach may include a team of medical and other professionals, team meetings, combined assessment procedures, care coordination, and follow-up clinic visits. A core multidisciplinary team may include one or more of the following professionals: allergist anesthesiologist gastroenterologist nurse nurse practitioner oncologist otolaryngologist physician assistant primary care physician (pediatrician in the case of a child, geriatrician in the case of elderly patients) pulmonologist registered dietitian SLP Depending on the age of the individual and the specific concerns, other team members may include the following: cardiologist coach/athletic trainer medical geneticist neurologist occupational therapist physical therapist psychologist radiologist respiratory therapist sleep specialist social worker or case manager sports medicine physician surgeon Screening by an SLP An SLP may be the first to see an individual who is experiencing voice or swallowing problems. These individuals may or may not have an underlying aerodigestive disorder. The purpose of screening is to identify individuals who require further assessment by an SLP or referral for other professional services. Screening may uncover findings that suggest underlying medical problems. It is important for SLPs to be familiar with anatomical structures affected by various aerodigestive disorders; be familiar with changes in feeding, swallowing, voice, and respiration problems that can be caused by aerodigestive disorders; recognize deviations in structure and function that warrant an aerodigestive evaluation by a physician; and make appropriate referrals, as needed. SLPs screen for the following observed and reported changes: Voice and respiration vocal quality (e.g., rough voice, strained voice) vocal effort (e.g., vocal fatigue, report of pain while voicing) presence of stridor or labored breathing that affects breath support for voicing rapid respiratory rate chronic cough Swallowing and dietary changes clinical signs of feeding and swallowing problems (e.g., coughing, throat clearing, discomfort or globus sensation when swallowing other indicators such as poor weight gain in infants and unintentional weight loss in adults, or purposeful avoidance of previously enjoyed liquids or foods SLPs also look for signs of neurologic conditions (e.g., abnormal sensorimotor function) that can affect voice, swallowing, or respiration, or that signal an underlying medical condition. If screening results indicate feeding, swallowing, or respiratory difficulties that suggest an underlying disease process, referral is made to an appropriate medical professional. Q: TREATMENT OF AERODIGESTIVE DISORDERS Decisions about goals and treatment options are made in partnership with the person, their family/caregiver, and other caregiving professionals. As part of a multidisciplinary team (see the Assessment section above), the speech-language pathologist (SLP) may be involved in assessing the individual\\'s response to medical treatment and in implementing both indirect and direct strategies during or following medical treatment. Comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment of aerodigestive disorders may include medical management (including pharmacotherapy and/or surgery) of underlying causes; indirect or compensatory treatment via environmental, dietary, and lifestyle modification; and direct or restorative intervention via voice, swallowing, and/or laryngeal airway treatment by an SLP. Q: MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF AERODIGESTIVE DISORDERS Medical management decisions in aerodigestive disorders balance airway needs for breathing with optimal preservation of vocal quality and swallowing integrity (Dinwiddie, 2004). Approaches vary from “wait and watch” to complex surgical interventions. Examples of medical approaches by appropriate medical professionals include, but are not limited to, the following: endoscopic treatment of structural abnormalities (e.g., dilation) medical or surgical management of the underlying disease/condition leading to the aerodigestive disorder surgical repair of structural abnormalities affecting aerodigestive function (e.g., arytenoidopexy, fundoplication, laryngeal cleft repair, supraglottoplasty, arytenoidectomy) Q: Dietary and Environmental Management Dietary, compensatory, and environmental management may include the following: Dietary changes, such as implementing elimination diets, conducting food challenges (systematic introduction of new foods or textures), reducing acid-producing foods, and increasing water intake to hydrate the vocal folds and to support healthy phonation. Compensatory changes, such as using positional strategies while eating or drinking (e.g., elevating the head of the bed, turning the head) and implementing maneuver-based strategies when eating and drinking (e.g., supraglottic swallow). Q: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF AERODIGESTIVE DISORDERS Environmental management, such as avoiding triggers (e.g., environmental pollutants, strenuous exercise). Q: Direct or Restorative Intervention SLPs provide direct or restorative treatment to address functional voice problems (including respiratory support for voicing) and feeding and swallowing problems. SLPs also provide direct treatment for laryngeal airway problems, including paradoxical vocal fold movement (PVFM), and chronic cough. The nature, scope, and duration of SLP management depend on: the underlying aerodigestive disorder, structures and functions affected, severity, and relevant history; the type and course of medications to treat underlying and co-occurring diseases; and the type and extent of surgical management required (e.g., surgical intervention and healing time, need for a temporary feeding tube). Q: TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS FOR PEDIATRICS Treatment selection depends on the child\\'s age, cognitive and physical abilities, and specific swallowing and feeding problems. Infants and young children with aerodigestive disorders may benefit from alterations of liquid viscosity to improve airway protection during swallowing and/or to reduce the impact of reflux when tube feeding. This may include the use of natural foods or commercial dietary thickening agents to increase liquid viscosity. When making such recommendations, SLPs should consult with the medical team and be aware of the possible impact of thickening agents on nutritional status and overall health. For example, the addition of a thickener may alter the nutritional composition of the formula or breast milk. This may require the child to ingest more volume in order to obtain the necessary nutrients, or it may provide more than the recommended calories or the amount of certain nutrients (e.g., more than the recommended iron, if rice cereal is the thickening agent). In addition, children with a history of necrotizing enterocolitis are advised to avoid gel-based thickeners containing the agent xanthan gum. Food allergies must also be considered when thickening agents are being considered. Q: PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES FOR PEDIATRICS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cautioned consumers about using commercial, gum-based thickeners for infants from birth to 1 year of age, especially when using the product to thicken breast milk. SLPs should be aware of these cautions and consult, as appropriate, with their facility to develop guidelines for using thickened liquids with infants. See FDA consumer cautions Q: Intervention measures for PVFM The goal of treatment is to establish consistent vocal fold abduction during the breathing cycle to maintain a patent airway. This reduces anxiety and affirms that breathing is consistently achievable, even in the presence of environmental or activity-related triggers. Behavioral management by an SLP is the preferred treatment approach to PVFM Other disciplines may also be involved in treatment (e.g., medical intervention to treat reflux or allergy triggers, when present). SLPs may implement the following procedures with most individuals with PVFM. Procedures are individualized based on triggers or other factors and include the following: Relaxed throat breathing—trains the vocal folds to abduct and remain abducted throughout the breathing cycle. Techniques include sniffing in through the nose with the tongue relaxed on the floor of the mouth and the lips gently touching, followed by exhalation through pursed lips or the production of a strident sound such as /s/, an sipping air in through pursed lips, followed by an exhalation through pursed lips or the production of a strident sound such as /s/. Diaphragmatic/abdominal breathing—trains attention to expansion of the lower rib cage and abdomen during inhalation to avoid clavicular breathing patterns and shoulder/neck tension. Once the individual has identified their most effective breathing technique, the SLP may introduce challenges (triggers) while using the technique. These include the following: Sports or exercise-specific training—implementing breathing techniques during a routine exercise activity or competitive sports training Training in the presence of environmental triggers (if applicable)—implementing breathing techniques during exposure to odors or other environmental triggers, beginning with non-noxious stimuli and progressing through noxious stimuli Q: Intervention measures for Chronic Cough The goal of treatment is to help the individual manage their cough by identifying triggers, using strategies to suppress the cough, reducing laryngeal irritation, and using healthy vocal hygiene behaviors. Speech-language services should be coordinated with medical management of the underlying cause; services should be implemented after ruling out or addressing other contributing factors. Treatment activities include the following: Educating the individual about chronic cough and its treatment, including discussing the difference between acute cough and chronic cough, emphasizing that chronic cough does not have physiological benefits; establishing cough suppression as a safe and achievable goal; defining the cough trigger threshold and desensitization of the cough response; and emphasizing the importance of adhering to medications prescribed by physicians to manage cough. Implementing healthy vocal hygiene practices to maximize hydration and reduce irritation of the vocal folds, including helping the individual identify behaviors that are contributing to the cough (e.g., poor hydration, mouth breathing) and practice healthy vocal hygiene behaviors (e.g., drinking plenty of water and talking at moderate volume). Teaching cough suppression strategies (as appropriate), including monitoring the cough precursor or trigger; using relaxed throat breathing or prolonged, slow exhalation (see PVFM above); using pursed-lip breathing; and substituting coughing with other behaviors or distractions such as sucking on ice or non-medicated candy and swallowing dry or with sips of water. The SLP typically introduces strategies without the presence of triggers to establish functional behaviors and to determine the person\\'s most consistent response. The SLP may then introduce stimulants such as strong odors, increased activity levels, or other identified triggers to help the individual use the strategies before the “need” to cough. Treatment ends when the person can manage cough across a variety of contexts and in the presence of triggers. Aerodigestive Disorder Differential Diagnosis List Q EPIDEMIOLOGY OF AERODIGESTIVE DISORDERS Aerodigestive foreign bodies are a notable subset of aerodigestive disorders. In a six-year study at Rwanda Military Hospital, aerodigestive foreign bodies accounted for 0.74% of ENT consultations (290 cases out of 39,240 patients), predominantly affecting toddlers aged 1–3 years (50.34%). Males were more commonly affected (57.24%) than females (42.76%). Another study from Nigeria reported a hospital prevalence of 0.61% for aerodigestive foreign bodies, with the mean patient age around 17 years and a male-to-female ratio of approximately 2.24:1. The youngest patient was 3 months old, and the oldest was 80 years. Neonatal aerodigestive disorders are significant due to their impact on feeding and respiration, with a high potential for lifelong morbidity and healthcare costs. These disorders involve complex coordination of swallowing and breathing, critical for infant development. Aerodigestive cancers, particularly of the upper aerodigestive tract (larynx, pharynx, oral cavity), represent a significant epidemiological burden worldwide. Approximately 500,000 new cases of upper aerodigestive tract cancers occur annually worldwide, with a strong male predominance (up to 85%) and peak incidence between 40 and 60 years of age. Pediatric aerodigestive foreign bodies are most common in children aged 1 to 5 years, consistent with the toddler and preschool age groups being at highest risk for foreign body aspiration or ingestion. Aerodigestive disorders may present across all age groups but show distinct epidemiological patterns: Children (especially toddlers and preschoolers) are most affected by foreign bodies and congenital/developmental aerodigestive anomalies. Adults and older adults are more commonly affected by aerodigestive cancers and chronic inflammatory conditions. Males tend to have a higher prevalence across many aerodigestive conditions, including foreign bodies and cancer Q: Doctor-Patient Conversation: Aerodigestive Disorder Doctor: Good morning! I understand you\\'ve been having some trouble with coughing and difficulty swallowing. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, doctor. For the past few months, I\\'ve had a persistent cough, especially after eating or drinking. Sometimes, I feel like food gets stuck in my throat, and I even choke a little. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your voice or any wheezing or noisy breathing? Patient: Actually, yes. My voice sounds a bit hoarse sometimes, and I occasionally hear a wheezing sound when I breathe. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. These symptoms suggest that there might be an issue involving both your airway and your swallowing function. Have you had any episodes of pneumonia or chest infections recently? Patient: I had pneumonia about six months ago, and before that, I had a few chest infections over the last year. Doctor: That information is important. Sometimes, problems with swallowing can cause food or liquids to accidentally enter the airway, leading to infections. We call this aspiration. To better understand what\\'s going on, I recommend we perform some tests, including a swallowing study and possibly a flexible endoscopy to look at your throat and airway. Patient: Will these tests be uncomfortable? Doctor: The swallowing study is non-invasive and involves eating or drinking substances with a contrast material while we take X-rays. The flexible endoscopy involves passing a thin, flexible camera through your nose to look at your throat and voice box; it might cause some mild discomfort but is generally well tolerated. Patient: Okay, that sounds reasonable. What treatments are available if something is found? Doctor: Depending on the cause, treatments can range from swallowing therapy with a speech-language pathologist to medications for reflux or inflammation. In some cases, surgery might be necessary if there are structural problems. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I’m glad we’re looking into this. Doctor: You\\'re welcome. We’ll work together to find the cause and the best way to help you feel better.

In one form of pulmonary hypertension, called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), blood vessels in the lungs are narrowed, blocked or destroyed. The damage makes it hard for blood to move through the lungs. Blood pressure in the lung arteries goes up. The heart must work harder to pump blood through the lungs. The extra effort eventually causes the heart muscle to become weak and fail. In some people, pulmonary hypertension slowly gets worse. It can be life-threatening. There\\'s no cure for pulmonary hypertension. But treatments are available to help you feel better, live longer and improve your quality of life. Pulmonary arterial hypertension strains the right side of your heart, which pumps oxygen-poor blood to your lungs. This strain can lead to right-sided heart failure. Plus, PAH slows down blood flow between your heart and lungs. This means less blood can enter your lungs to gain fresh oxygen. As a result, blood flow to the rest of your body also slows down. So, your organs and tissues can’t get enough oxygen. Without treatment, PAH can be fatal. Q: CAUSES OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Pulmonary hypertension is caused by changes in the cells that line the lung arteries. The changes can make the artery walls narrow, stiff, swollen and thick. It gets harder for blood to flow through the lungs. Pulmonary hypertension is sorted into five groups, depending on the cause. Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) Causes include: Unknown cause, called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Changes in a gene passed down through families, called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension. Use of some medicines or illicit drugs, including methamphetamine. Heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. Other health conditions, including scleroderma, lupus and cirrhosis. Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease This is the most common form of pulmonary hypertension. Causes include: Left heart failure. Left-sided heart valve disease, including mitral valve or aortic valve disease. Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease Causes include: Scarring of the lungs, called pulmonary fibrosis. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also called COPD. A sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts, called sleep apnea. Being at high altitudes for extended periods of time, if you are at high risk of pulmonary hypertension. Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by blockages in the pulmonary artery Causes include: Blood clots in the lungs that don\\'t go away. Tumors that block the pulmonary artery. Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension triggered by other health conditions Causes include: Blood disorders, including polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Inflammatory disorders such as sarcoidosis. Conditions that affect the body\\'s ability to break down certain sugars, including glycogen storage disease. Kidney disease. Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome can lead to pulmonary hypertension. Eisenmenger syndrome is a long-term complication of an unrepaired heart condition present at birth. An example is a large hole in the heart between the two lower heart chambers called a ventricular septal defect. The unrepaired hole in the heart causes oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood. The blood then goes to the lungs instead of going to the rest of the body. This increases pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Q: RISK FACTORS OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Pulmonary hypertension is usually seen in people ages 30 to 60. Growing older can increase the risk of developing Group 1 pulmonary hypertension, called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH from an unknown cause is more common in younger adults. Other things that can raise the risk of pulmonary hypertension are: A family history of the condition. Being overweight. Smoking. Blood-clotting disorders or a family history of blood clots in the lungs. A history of being around asbestos. A heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. Living at an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) or higher. Use of some medicines, including those used for weight loss. Illicit drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine. Q: SIGNS / SYMPTOMS OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension develop slowly. You may not notice them for months or even years. Symptoms get worse as the disease continues. Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: Shortness of breath. It may first start during exercise and eventually happen at rest. Blue or gray skin. Depending on skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see. Chest pressure or pain. Dizziness or fainting. Fast pulse or pounding heartbeat. Fatigue. Swelling in the ankles, legs and belly area. These symptoms may be caused by many other health conditions. See a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. Q: DIAGNOSIS OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Pulmonary hypertension is hard to diagnose early. It\\'s not often found during a routine physical exam. Even when pulmonary hypertension is more advanced, its symptoms are similar to those of other heart and lung conditions. To diagnose pulmonary hypertension, a healthcare professional examines you and asks about your symptoms. You are usually asked questions about your medical and family history. Q: TESTS FOR PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Tests to diagnose pulmonary hypertension may include: Blood tests. Blood tests can help find the cause of pulmonary hypertension. The test also may help find complications of the disease. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray is a picture of the heart, lungs and chest. It may be used to check for other lung conditions that can cause pulmonary hypertension. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This simple test records the electrical activity of the heart. It shows how the heart is beating. Echocardiogram. Sound waves create pictures of the beating heart. An echocardiogram shows how blood flows through the heart and heart valves. This test may be done to help diagnose pulmonary hypertension or to learn how treatments are working. Sometimes, an echocardiogram is done while exercising on a stationary bike or treadmill to learn how activity affects the heart. If you have this test, you may be asked to wear a mask that checks how well the heart and lungs use oxygen and carbon dioxide. Right heart catheterization. If an echocardiogram shows pulmonary hypertension, this test may be done to confirm the diagnosis. During this procedure, a doctor places a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the neck. The tube is gently guided into the lower right heart chamber and the pulmonary artery. The doctor can then measure blood pressure in the main pulmonary arteries and the right ventricle. Other tests may be done to check the condition of the lungs and pulmonary arteries. The following tests may give more information about the cause of pulmonary hypertension: Exercise stress tests. These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heartbeat is watched. They can show how the heart reacts to exercise. Computerized tomography (CT) scan. This test uses X-rays to make pictures of specific parts of the body. Dye called contrast may be given into a vein to help the blood vessels show up more clearly on the images. A heart CT scan, called a cardiac CT scan, can show the size of the heart and any blockages in the pulmonary arteries. It can help diagnose lung diseases that might lead to pulmonary hypertension. Examples are COPD or pulmonary fibrosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to make detailed pictures of the heart. It can show blood flow in the pulmonary arteries. The test may be done to learn how well the right lower heart chamber is working. Lung function test. For this test, you blow into a special device. The device measures how much air the lungs can hold. It shows how air flows in and out of the lungs. Sleep study. A sleep study measures brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and other things as you sleep. The test can help diagnose sleep apnea, which can cause pulmonary hypertension. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan. In this test, a radioactive tracer is given through a vein (IV). The tracer shows how blood flows. You also may breathe in a tracer that shows airflow to the lungs. A V/Q scan can tell whether blood clots are causing symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. Lung biopsy. Rarely, a sample of tissue may be taken from the lung to check for a possible cause of pulmonary hypertension. Genetic testing: Screening for gene changes that cause pulmonary hypertension may be recommended. If you have these gene changes, other family members may need to be screened too. Pulmonary hypertension functional classification Once a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is confirmed, the condition is classified according to how the symptoms affect you and your ability to do everyday tasks. Pulmonary hypertension may fall into one of the following groups: Class I. Pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed, but there are no symptoms during rest or exercise. Class II. There are no symptoms at rest. Everyday chores or activities such as going to work or the grocery store may cause some shortness of breath or mild chest pain. There\\'s a slight limitation of physical activity. Class III. It\\'s comfortable at rest, but doing simple tasks such as bathing, dressing or preparing meals causes fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain. The ability to do physical activity becomes very limited. Class IV. Symptoms occur at rest and during physical activity. Any type of activity causes increasing discomfort. Your healthcare team may use a risk calculator that looks at symptoms and test results to understand what type of treatment is needed. This is called pulmonary hypertension risk stratification. Q: TREATMENT OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION There\\'s no cure for pulmonary hypertension. But treatments can improve symptoms and help you live longer. Treatment also can help keep the disease from getting worse. It often takes some time to find the best pulmonary hypertension treatment. The treatments are often complex. You usually need a lot of health checkups. Medications FOR PULMONARY HYPERTENSION If you have pulmonary hypertension, you may get medicines to treat your symptoms and help you feel better. Medicines also may be used to treat or prevent complications. Treatment may include: Medicines to relax blood vessels, called vasodilators. These medicines open narrowed blood vessels and improve blood flow. The medicine may be breathed in, taken by mouth or given through a vein. Sometimes, it\\'s given continuously through a small pump attached to the body. Examples of vasodilators to treat pulmonary hypertension include epoprostenol (Flolan, Veletri), treprostinil (Remodulin, Tyvaso, others), iloprost and selexipag (Uptravi). Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. This type of medicine relaxes the pulmonary arteries and lowers pressure in the lungs. An example is riociguat (Adempas). Do not take these medicines if you\\'re pregnant. Medicines to widen blood vessels. Medicines called endothelin receptor antagonists reverse the effect of a substance in the walls of blood vessels that causes them to narrow. Such medicines include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit) and ambrisentan (Letairis). They may improve energy level and symptoms. Do not take these medicines if you\\'re pregnant. Medicines to increase blood flow. Medicines called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors may be used to increase blood flow through the lungs. These medicines also are used to treat erectile dysfunction. They include sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Adcirca, Alyq, Cialis). High-dose calcium channel blockers. These medicines help relax the muscles in the walls of blood vessels. They include amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and nifedipine (Procardia). Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with pulmonary hypertension improve while taking them. Blood thinners. Also called anticoagulants, these medicines help prevent blood clots. One example is warfarin (Jantoven). The medicines can increase the risk of bleeding. This is especially true if you\\'re having surgery or a treatment that enters the body or creates an opening in the skin. Talk to your healthcare team about your risk. Digoxin (Lanoxin). This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. It can help control irregular heartbeats. Water pills, also called diuretics. These medicines help the kidneys remove excess fluid from the body. This reduces the amount of work the heart has to do. Diuretics also may be used to reduce fluid buildup in the lungs, legs and belly area. Oxygen therapy. Breathing pure oxygen may be suggested if you live at a high altitude or have sleep apnea. Some people with pulmonary hypertension need oxygen therapy all the time. Surgery or other procedures If medicines do not help control the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension, surgery may be recommended. Surgeries and procedures to treat pulmonary hypertension may include: Atrial septostomy. This treatment may be done if medicines don\\'t control pulmonary hypertension symptoms. In an atrial septostomy, a doctor creates an opening between the upper left and right chambers of the heart. The opening reduces the pressure on the right side of the heart. Potential complications include irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias. Lung or heart-lung transplant. Sometimes, a lung or heart-lung transplant may be needed, especially for younger people who have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. After a transplant, medicine must be taken for life to prevent the body from rejecting the new organ. pulmonary hypertension (PH) treatment drugs and their common side effects 1.

Try these tips: Eat healthy. Eat a healthy diet rich in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products. Try to stay away from saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol. Use less salt. Stay as active as possible and manage weight. Even mild forms of activity might be too exhausting for some people who have pulmonary hypertension. For others, moderate exercise, such as walking, might be helpful — especially when done during oxygen therapy. Your healthcare team can help you plan an appropriate exercise program. Don\\'t smoke. If you smoke, quit. If you need help, ask your healthcare team for treatment that can help. Avoid secondhand smoke too, if possible. Get plenty of rest. Resting can reduce tiredness related to pulmonary hypertension. Avoid high altitudes. High altitudes can make pulmonary hypertension worse. If you live at an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) or higher, you might be told to consider moving to a lower altitude. Avoid activities that can lower blood pressure a lot. These include sitting in a hot tub or sauna or taking long hot baths or showers. Such activities lower blood pressure and can cause fainting. Also, do not do activities that cause a lot of straining, such as lifting heavy objects or weights. Tell your healthcare team about the medicines you take. Some medicines can make pulmonary hypertension worse or affect its treatment. Get regular health checkups. Tell your healthcare team about any new or worsening symptoms or medicine side effects. If pulmonary hypertension affects your quality of life, ask about treatments that could help. Get recommended vaccines. Respiratory infections can cause serious health concerns for people with pulmonary hypertension. Ask your healthcare team which vaccines you need to prevent common viral infections. Talk to a healthcare professional before becoming pregnant. Pulmonary hypertension can cause serious complications for the pregnant person and unborn baby, also called a fetus. Birth control pills can increase the risk of blood clots. Talk to your healthcare team about other birth control options. Complications OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Potential complications of pulmonary hypertension are: Right-sided heart enlargement and heart failure. Also called cor pulmonale, this condition causes the heart\\'s right lower chamber to get larger. The chamber has to pump harder than usual to move blood through narrowed or blocked lung arteries. As a result, the heart walls get thick. The right lower heart chamber stretches to increase the amount of blood it can hold. These changes create more strain on the heart. Eventually the right lower heart chamber fails. Blood clots. Pulmonary hypertension increases the risk of blood clots in the small arteries in the lungs. Irregular heartbeats, also called arrhythmias. Pulmonary hypertension can cause changes in the heartbeat, which can be life-threatening. Bleeding in the lungs. Pulmonary hypertension can lead to life-threatening bleeding in the lungs and coughing up blood. Pregnancy complications. Pulmonary hypertension can be life-threatening for the mother and the developing baby. Outlook / Prognosis OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION The outlook for people with pulmonary hypertension depends on: The cause of PH. How early it’s diagnosed. The severity of symptoms. Associated medical conditions. The outlook for each person is different. Talk with your provider to learn more about your prognosis and how to manage your condition. Can pulmonary hypertension be cured? Most cases of pulmonary hypertension can’t be cured. Your provider may prescribe medications to: Ease your symptoms. Improve your quality of life. Slow down the progression of the disease. Your provider may also recommend lifestyle changes. However, surgery can cure some people with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The life expectancy varies from person to person. It depends how quickly you’re diagnosed and what other medical conditions you have. Talk with your provider about what you can expect in your individual situation. Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive disease. That means it gets worse over time. It progresses more quickly in some people than in others. Treatment can improve your chances of surviving pulmonary hypertension for many years. Is pulmonary hypertension fatal? Without treatment, pulmonary hypertension leads to right-sided heart failure and, ultimately, death. Treatment can help you live longer and give you a better quality of life. Prevention Risk factors for developing pulmonary hypertension include: Exposure to asbestos. Family history of blood clots. Family history of pulmonary hypertension. Living at high altitudes. Smoking and using tobacco products. Use of diet medications such as “fen-phen” (dexfenfluramine and phentermine). Use of some prescription medications that treat cancer and depression. Use of recreational drugs. Certain medical conditions also raise your risk. These include: Blood clots in your pulmonary arteries. Connective tissue disease. Down syndrome. Gaucher disease. Heart disease. HIV. Liver disease. Lung disease. Talk with your provider about your risk factors and what you can do to lower your risk. How can I prevent pulmonary hypertension? It’s not always possible to prevent pulmonary hypertension. Some risk factors are out of your control. If you have risk factors, your provider may recommend preventive screenings to check your heart and lung function. Doing whatever you can to prevent or manage other medical conditions can help lower your risk of pulmonary hypertension. Steps you can take include: Create an exercise plan. Ask your provider what exercises are safe for you. Follow a heart-healthy diet. Avoid processed foods, fast food and other foods high in salt and saturated fat. Quit smoking and stop using tobacco. Smoking and tobacco use are top risk factors for heart and lung problems. Quitting isn’t easy, especially if you’ve been smoking or using tobacco for a long time. But your provider can help provide resources. Support groups may also help. Take medications for blood pressure and other conditions as prescribed. Living With PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Talk with your provider about how to manage and monitor your condition. Your provider will tell you when you need to come in for checkups and tests. Be sure to tell your provider about any new or changing symptoms. Also, talk with your provider about: Birth control options and whether it’s safe to become pregnant. Pregnancy is risky for people with pulmonary hypertension. Creating an emergency kit. People with pulmonary hypertension need certain supplies and information with them at all times. Ask your provider what you should include in your emergency kit. Exercise. Ask what’s safe for you and how best to add exercise into your daily life. Ask what exercises to avoid. Seasonal vaccines, including for flu and pneumonia. Your provider will let you know which vaccines you should receive. Support groups or counseling as you adjust to the “new normal” of life with pulmonary hypertension. A medical diagnosis brings many emotions. You don’t have to carry them alone. Travel plans. You may need to take certain precautions if flying on an airplane. You may also need to be careful when traveling to high altitudes. Talk with your provider about how to prepare for travel and what to bring with you. What dietary changes should I make? Your provider will give you specific recommendations. One key step involves reducing your sodium intake. This means: Avoid adding salt at the table or using “seasoning salt.” Avoid smoked, cured, salted and canned meat products. Buy foods that are “low sodium” or “low salt.” Limit fast foods and prepared foods. Other dietary changes include: Eat foods high in fiber (like whole grains, bran, fruits and vegetables). Eat foods high in potassium (like dried fruits, bananas and oranges). Eat foods high in magnesium (like peanuts, tofu and broccoli). Limit foods that contain refined sugar, saturated fat and cholesterol. When should I call my healthcare provider? Call your provider if you’re having problems with: A fast heart rate (120 beats per minute). A respiratory infection or cough that’s getting worse. Constantly feeling dizzy or lightheaded. Episodes of chest pain or discomfort with physical activity. Extreme fatigue or decreased ability to do your normal activities. Nausea or lack of appetite. Restlessness or confusion. Shortness of breath that’s gotten worse, especially if you wake up feeling short of breath. Swelling in your ankles, legs or tummy that’s gotten worse. Trouble breathing with regular activities or at rest. Weight gain (2 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in one week). Go to the emergency department or call your local emergency number if you have: A fast heart rate (120-150 beats per minute) that won’t go down. Fainting spells with loss of consciousness. Hickman catheter complications with intravenous prostacyclins. These include infection, catheter displacement, solution leak, bleeding and IV pump malfunction. Shortness of breath that doesn’t go away when you rest. Sudden and severe chest pain. Sudden and severe headache. Sudden weakness or paralysis in your arms or legs. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Q1. What is the likely cause of my symptoms or condition? A. Pulmonary hypertension is caused by increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. The causes vary and include: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): idiopathic, inherited, or associated with connective tissue diseases, HIV, or drugs. Left heart disease: such as left ventricular dysfunction or valvular disease. Lung diseases: COPD, interstitial lung disease, or sleep apnea. Chronic blood clots: chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Other rare causes: metabolic or systemic disorders. Your symptoms like breathlessness, fatigue, and swelling may be due to increased strain on the right side of your heart from elevated pulmonary artery pressures. Q2. What are other possible causes? A. Other conditions with similar symptoms include: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Heart failure Interstitial lung disease Asthma Pulmonary embolism Anemia or other systemic illnesses Because symptoms overlap, thorough testing is needed to differentiate. Q3. What tests do I need? A. Common tests to diagnose and evaluate PH include: Echocardiogram: estimates pulmonary artery pressure and heart function. Right heart catheterization: gold standard to measure pulmonary artery pressures directly and confirm diagnosis. Electrocardiogram (ECG): assesses heart rhythm and right heart strain. Chest X-ray and CT scan: evaluate lung structure and possible causes. Pulmonary function tests: assess lung capacity and function. Blood tests: rule out other diseases like thyroid, liver disease. Exercise tests: 6-minute walk test or cardiopulmonary exercise testing to assess functional capacity. Ventilation-perfusion scan: to detect chronic blood clots (CTEPH). Q4. What treatment do you recommend? A. Treatment depends on the type and cause of PH: For pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): targeted therapies such as endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, prostacyclin analogues, or soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators. For CTEPH: surgical removal of clots (pulmonary thromboendarterectomy) or targeted medications if surgery is not possible. For PH caused by left heart or lung disease: managing the underlying condition (e.g., heart failure treatment, oxygen therapy). Supportive care: diuretics for fluid retention, anticoagulation if indicated, and oxygen supplementation. Q5. What are the other treatment options? A. Combination therapy: using two or more PH-specific drugs. Lung transplantation: considered in severe, refractory cases. Lifestyle modifications: including supervised exercise programs. Clinical trials: for novel therapies. Treatment of contributing factors like sleep apnea or anemia. Q6. Is there a generic form of the medicine you\\'re prescribing? A. Some PH medications like sildenafil (a PDE-5 inhibitor) are available in generic forms. Many newer drugs, such as endothelin receptor antagonists and prostacyclin analogues, may still be brand-name only, depending on your country and insurance coverage. Your doctor or pharmacist can provide specific information on generics available to you. Q7. What\\'s an appropriate level of physical activity? A. Physical activity should be tailored to your functional class: Mild to moderate exercise is encouraged in stable patients. Avoid strenuous or high-intensity activities if you experience symptoms. Pulmonary rehabilitation or supervised exercise programs are beneficial. Your doctor will advise based on your symptoms and test results. Q8. Are there any restrictions that I need to follow? A. Avoid high altitudes or situations causing low oxygen levels. Limit strenuous physical activity if symptomatic. Avoid pregnancy due to high risks. Avoid medications that can worsen PH (e.g., certain appetite suppressants, stimulants). Follow dietary recommendations, including sodium restriction if fluid retention occurs. Q9. How often do I need health checkups? A. Regular follow-up every 3 to 6 months is typical. Monitoring includes symptom assessment, echocardiograms, blood tests, and exercise capacity. Frequency may increase if your condition worsens or treatment changes. Q10. I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together? A. Coordinated care with your cardiologist, pulmonologist, and primary care provider is essential. Manage comorbidities such as heart disease, lung disease, or sleep apnea aggressively. Inform all your doctors about your PH diagnosis and medications to avoid drug interactions. Lifestyle modifications like smoking cessation, weight management, and controlling blood pressure are important. Q11. Should I see a specialist? A. Yes, PH requires evaluation and management by specialists in pulmonary hypertension or cardiology. Referral to a pulmonary hypertension center is recommended for diagnosis confirmation and treatment planning Genomic Data on Pulmonary Hypertension: BMPR2 gene mutations are the most common genetic cause of PAH. BMPR2 encodes a receptor in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily that regulates cell growth in pulmonary arteries. Mutations in BMPR2 lead to excessive cell proliferation and narrowing of small pulmonary arteries, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and pressure. Inheritance pattern: BMPR2 mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner but with incomplete penetrance (~10–30%). This means not all carriers develop PAH. Women have a higher penetrance than men. Each child of a carrier has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation, but only about 20% of those with the mutation develop the disease during their lifetime. Other genes implicated include: ALK1 (ACVRL1) and ENG (endoglin), associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and PAH. EIF2AK4, linked to pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH), inherited recessively. CAV1 and KCNK3, among others, identified in some familial and idiopathic cases. Genetic mutations explain over 70% of familial PAH cases and about 10–40% of idiopathic PAH cases. The presence of a mutation often requires additional environmental or biological \"second hits\" such as hypoxia, inflammation, or drug exposure to trigger disease manifestation. Genetic testing panels mainly focus on BMPR2 and related genes but may not cover all rare mutations Diagnostic Considerations OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Other WHO groups of pulmonary hypertensions should be considered as coincident or alternative diagnoses. These include pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO group 1), pulmonary hypertension (WHO groups 2, 3, and 5), and other pulmonary arterial obstruction (e.g., tumors of the pulmonary artery, pulmonary artery stenoses, arteritis, and mediastinal fibrosis). Differential Diagnoses OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Pulmonary Embolism CT Imaging and Diagnosis Atrial Septal Defect Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) CREST Syndrome Drug-Induced Pulmonary Toxicity Emphysema High Altitude Pulmonary Hypertension HIV Infection and AIDS Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Connective Tissue Disease-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease (CTD-ILD) Mitral Regurgitation Mitral Stenosis Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Pediatric Obesity-Hypoventilation Syndrome Portopulmonary syndrome Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Restrictive Lung Disease Schistosomiasis (Bilharzia) Scleroderma Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Vascular Surgery for Arteriovenous Malformations Ventricular Septal Defects Epidemiology OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION According to registry data, there are no sex differences in the prevalence of CTEPH. The average age onset is usually in the 60s. Nonresolution of PE is the most common cause of CTEPH. In a European registry, 75% of patients with CTEPH reported previous PE. The incidence of CTEPH after acute PE is not clear. A review estimates that the full incidence of CTEPH in the United States is 4,886 cases per year, based on an incidence of CTEPH after PE of 0.57% reported by Klok et al. Possibly the most quoted study related to PE incidence was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2004. In this study, 223 patients with acute PE and without a previous venous thromboembolic event were followed for 10 years. Seven (3.8%) of 223 patients developed symptomatic CTEPH 2 years after the initial thromboembolic event. Other studies corroborated the fact that the majority of CTEPH cases developed 2 years after the initial event of acute PE. Historically, between 0.1% and 0.5% of patients with PE were thought to develop CTEPH. [3] In 2006, another study showed that CTEPH developed in 1% of patients with acute PE, but this study excluded patients with known venous thromboembolic risk development. Since then, other studies have revealed a prevalence of 0.4-4.8%. These rate differences are likely due to the different populations studied, different methods of screening, and follow-up duration. In summary, irrespective of the rate of CTEPH from PE used in estimates, it is clear that a large proportion of CTEPH cases are underdiagnosed each year. Factors contributing to this underdiagnosis and treatment include poor specificity of initial signs and symptoms and unknown PE history at presentation. The epidemiological analysis suggests that the full incidence of CTEPH in the United States and Europe ranges from 3-5 cases per 100,000 population per year. The average diagnosis rate was 14.2% for the United States and Europe in 2013, which equates to a diagnosed incidence of 4-7 cases per million. Although the incidence of PE in Japan is substantially lower than the incidence observed in United States and Europe, the rate of CTEPH is much higher. This disparity might be related to genetics, population demographics, or lifestyle, among other factors. An alternative explanation is that only severe cases of PE might be diagnosed, while mild cases might not be recognized or reported. Not only diagnosis, but also proper referral to an expert center, seem to be delayed in CTEPH. In one study, the mean delay from symptom onset to diagnosis of CTEPH was 18 ±26 months. This also transpires in the severity of disease, since most of the patients present with WHO functional class III and IV. Late diagnosis can negatively impact treatment options and overall quality of life. Epidemiological projections in seven countries indicate that the incidence of CTEPH, especially late-stage disease, will increase over time from 32,636 cases (16%) diagnosed in 2015 to 37,009 cases (28%) in 2025. Pulmonary hypertension can affect people of any age. Present estimates suggest a prevalence of approximately 1% in the global population. Left heart disease (LHD) is the leading cause, followed by lung disease, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In developing countries, CHD, infectious diseases like schistosomiasis and HIV, and high altitude are significant pulmonary hypertension causes. PAH incidence is approximately 6 cases per million adults, and the prevalence is about 49 to 55 cases per million adults. PAH was initially thought to affect predominantly young women. However, recent data show that the condition is also prevalent in patients aged 65 years and older with cardiovascular comorbidities, leveling the sex distribution. At least 50% of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction either have IpcPH or CpcPH.The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension increases with disease severity in these patients, with 60 to 70% of patients with severe and symptomatic mitral valve disease and 50% with symptomatic aortic stenosis affected by pulmonary hypertension. Mild pulmonary hypertension is common in patients with advanced COPD and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Only 1% to 5% of patients with advanced COPD were found to have severe pulmonary hypertension. The prevalence increases with increasing severity in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and is as high as 60% in patients with end-stage disease. Registry data indicate that CTEPH’s incidence and prevalence are 2 to 6 and 26 to 39 cases per million adults, respectively. Pulmonary hypertension in individuals with sarcoidosis is frequent and often associated with increased mortality and morbidity Guidelines Summary OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION The guidelines have been endorsed by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) and the European Reference Network on rare respiratory diseases (ERN-LUNG) Among the key changes were a lowered cutoff from mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) >25 mm Hg. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is now defined by a mPAP >20 mm Hg at rest. The definition of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) also implies a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) >2 Wood Units and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ≤15 mm Hg. Diagnosis The diagnostic algorithm was also restructured so that the diagnosis is made earlier. The following three steps are now included in the algorithm: Step 1: Suspicion by a general practitioner or other primary care provider. Step 2: Detection by echocardiography. Step 3: Confirmation with right heart catheterization in a pulmonary hypertension center. If the patient probably has intermediate or high-risk pulmonary hypertension, then he or she should be referred to a pulmonary hypertension center for a comprehensive diagnostic workup and invasive assessment, as needed. In patients with acute PE, and the following clinical conditions, ventilation-perfusion lung scanning, echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing should be performed to assess for CTEPH: Radiological signs suggest CTEPH on the computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) performed to diagnose PE and/or estimated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) is >60 mmHg on echocardiogram Persistent or new-onset dyspnea or exercise limitation post-PE Asymptomatic patients with risk factors for CTEPH or a high CTEPH prediction score High risk factors for CTEPH include : Permanent intravascular devices (pacemaker, long-term central lines, ventriculoatrial shunts) Inflammatory bowel disease Essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera Splenectomy Antiphospholipid syndrome High-dose thyroid hormone replacement Treatment Key recommendations specific to management of group CTEPH and CTEPD without PH are summarized below. All patients with CTEPH should receive lifelong anticoagulation therapy and be tested for antiphospholipid syndrome; patients positive for antiphospholipid syndrome should receive a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for anticoagulation therapy. The treatment of choice is pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) for patients with fibrotic obstructions within pulmonary arteries accessible by surgery. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is recommended for the following patients with distal obstructions amenable to BPA : PTE cannot be performed due to technical inoperability Persistent/residual PH after PTE Consider medical therapy prior to BPA. Long-term follow-up is required for patients following PEA and BPA, as well as for patients with CTEPH on medical therapy. Riociguat is recommended for symptomatic patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent PH after PTE. The following medications may be considered for management of inoperable CTEPH in select patients: Subcutaneous treprostinil Off-label use of PAH medications Combination of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator/phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5i), endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), or parenteral prostacyclin analogues DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Doctor: Hello, how have you been feeling since our last visit? Patient: I’ve been more short of breath lately, especially when I walk or climb stairs. Sometimes I feel tired and dizzy. Doctor: I’m sorry to hear that. These symptoms can be related to your pulmonary hypertension. Let’s talk about what might be causing this change and how we can help you feel better. Patient: What exactly is causing my symptoms? Doctor: Pulmonary hypertension means the blood pressure in your lungs’ arteries is higher than normal. This puts extra strain on your heart. The causes vary, but in your case, it’s related to the narrowing of the small blood vessels in your lungs, which makes it harder for blood to flow through. Patient: Are there other things that could cause these symptoms? Doctor: Yes, symptoms like breathlessness and fatigue can also be caused by heart failure, lung diseases like COPD, or anemia. That’s why we do tests to be sure. Patient: What tests do I need now? Doctor: We’ll start with an echocardiogram to check your heart function and estimate the pressure in your lungs. We may also do a right heart catheterization, which is the best way to measure lung pressures directly. Other tests like lung function tests and blood work will help us understand your overall health. Patient: What treatments do you recommend? Doctor: Based on your diagnosis, we’ll use medications that help open the blood vessels in your lungs and reduce the pressure. These include drugs like endothelin receptor antagonists or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. We’ll also manage symptoms with diuretics if you have fluid retention. Patient: Are there other treatment options? Doctor: Yes, sometimes combination therapy with more than one medication is needed. In severe cases, procedures like lung transplantation or surgery for chronic clots might be considered. Lifestyle changes and supervised exercise can also improve your quality of life. Patient: Is there a generic version of the medicine you’re prescribing? Doctor: Some medications, like sildenafil, are available as generics. Others may only be available as brand-name drugs. We’ll consider cost and availability when choosing your treatment. Patient: What about physical activity? How much can I do? Doctor: Moderate, supervised exercise is encouraged to maintain your strength, but avoid strenuous activities that worsen your symptoms. We can refer you to a pulmonary rehab program for guidance. Patient: Are there any restrictions I should follow? Doctor: Avoid high altitudes and situations that lower your oxygen levels. Also, avoid pregnancy as it poses high risks. It’s important to avoid medications that can worsen PH, and we’ll review all your medicines carefully. Patient: How often do I need checkups? Doctor: Usually every 3 to 6 months, but if your symptoms change, we might see you sooner to adjust treatment. Patient: I have other health problems. How do I manage them with PH? Doctor: Coordinating care is key. We’ll work with your other doctors to manage all your conditions safely and effectively. Patient: Should I see a specialist? Doctor: Yes, managing PH is complex, and care at a specialized center improves outcomes. I’ll refer you to a pulmonary hypertension specialist. Patient: Is there information I can take home? Any websites you recommend? Doctor: Absolutely. I’ll give you some printed materials, and you can visit trusted sites like the Pulmonary Hypertension Association (phassociation.org) and the American Lung Association (lung.org). They offer excellent patient resources and support groups. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you explaining all this. Doctor: You’re welcome. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have questions or concerns.

As a result, blood can’t flow through your lungs as well as it should. This leads to high blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries. These are the arteries that carry oxygen-poor blood from your heart to your lungs. Eventually, your heart gets weaker because it has to work harder to pump blood to your lungs. Without treatment, PAH can cause a cascade of problems in your heart, lungs and the rest of your body. PAH is one form of pulmonary hypertension. This is a general diagnosis for high blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries from any cause. How does pulmonary arterial hypertension affect my body? Pulmonary arterial hypertension strains the right side of your heart, which pumps oxygen-poor blood to your lungs. This strain can lead to right-sided heart failure. Plus, PAH slows down blood flow between your heart and lungs. This means less blood can enter your lungs to gain fresh oxygen. As a result, blood flow to the rest of your body also slows down. So, your organs and tissues can’t get enough oxygen. Without treatment, PAH can be fatal. How serious is pulmonary arterial hypertension? Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a serious condition that can be life-threatening. An early diagnosis and swift treatment can help you live longer and have a better quality of life. Who does pulmonary arterial hypertension affect? Pulmonary arterial hypertension can affect adults at any age. It’s more common among females, who are usually diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 60. Males over age 65 who develop PAH are more likely to have severe cases. PAH can also affect infants. This condition is known as persistent pulmonary hypertension in the neonate (PPHN). PAH isn’t as common as other forms of pulmonary hypertension, including those caused by underlying heart or lung disease. Each year, about 500 to 1,000 people are diagnosed with PAH in the U.S. In Western countries, about 25 per 1 million people are living with PAH. Symptoms OF Pulmonary arterial hypertension You may not feel any symptoms early on. Most people with PAH begin to notice symptoms as the condition progresses. These symptoms can include: Blue fingers or lips. Chest pain or pressure. Dizziness or fainting. Fatigue. Racing or pounding heartbeat. Shortness of breath that gets worse over time. Swelling (edema) in your feet and legs, later progressing to your belly and neck. Without treatment, PAH symptoms continue to get worse over time. You may find it harder to do your usual activities without needing to catch your breath or rest. CAUSES OF Pulmonary arterial hypertension Damage to the lining of the blood vessels in your lungs leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension. It’s not always clear what causes this damage. When there’s no clear cause, you have what’s called “idiopathic” pulmonary arterial hypertension. Other times, there is a clear cause. Known causes of PAH include associated medical conditions, genetic mutations and certain drugs. Medical conditions that may lead to the development of PAH include: Congenital heart disease. Glycogen storage diseases. HIV. Liver disease. Lupus. Portal hypertension. Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Schistosomiasis. Scleroderma. Genetic mutations can also cause pulmonary arterial hypertension. Here’s what we know about genetics and PAH: Mutations in your BMPR2 gene are usually responsible. This gene manages how many cells you have in specific tissues. When there’s a mutation in this gene, you can end up with too many cells in the small arteries of your lungs. This overcrowding of cells narrows the opening of your arteries. PAH can run in families. This is called heritable PAH. About 80% of people with heritable PAH have mutations to their BMPR2 gene. Some people carry an altered gene without ever developing PAH. Some people develop PAH caused by genetic mutations even though they have no family history of the condition. This is called sporadic PAH. Certain drugs can cause PAH, including: Diet pills like “fen-phen.” This drug isn’t available anymore, since research has shown it’s dangerous. But it may cause PAH many years after you’ve stopped taking it. Recreational drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine. Diagnosis and Tests OF Pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH can be hard to diagnose because its symptoms could be caused by many other conditions. Your provider will perform a physical exam and talk with you about your symptoms and medical history. You’ll likely need many tests (including imaging tests and blood tests) to find out if you have pulmonary hypertension and if so, which form. Your provider may also refer you to a pulmonologist or cardiologist. These specialists will run specific tests to check your heart and lung function. They’ll determine what form of pulmonary hypertension you have (PAH or another form). They’ll also evaluate how far your condition has progressed. PAH requires specific types of treatment that can’t be used for other forms of pulmonary hypertension. So, your care team must learn as much as possible about what’s happening in your lungs and your heart. This information helps them tailor treatment to your specific diagnosis and needs. Your care team will use a combination of different tests to rule out other conditions and diagnose PAH. If your provider suspects you have PAH based on your physical exam, the first test they’ll order for you is a transthoracic echocardiogram. This test evaluates the overall structure and function of your heart. Other tests may include: Blood tests: To check organ function and hormone levels and identify underlying disorders. Specific blood tests include a complete metabolic panel and complete blood count. Chest CT scan: To check for (and rule out) kidney disease. Chest X-ray: To see if your heart or pulmonary arteries are bigger than they should be. Heart MRI: To evaluate your right ventricle (the chamber of your heart that pumps blood to your pulmonary arteries). Polysomnogram (PSG): To check if you have sleep apnea, which can make PAH worse. A PSG is one type of overnight sleep test. Pulmonary function tests: To check your lung function. Pulmonary ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan: To check for blood clots in your lungs. This test can rule out chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Right heart catheterization: To measure your pulmonary artery pressures. This test is essential for diagnosing PAH. Six-minute walk test: To see how much exercise you can handle and how much oxygen circulates in your blood while you move. Talk with your provider about the tests you need and how to prepare for them. What are the criteria for diagnosing pulmonary arterial hypertension? Providers diagnose pulmonary hypertension based on the blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries. The criterion for diagnosis is pulmonary arterial pressure higher than 20 mmHg while you’re at rest. A right heart catheterization measures this number. Management and Treatment OF Pulmonary arterial hypertension Treatment for PAH focuses on slowing down its progression and giving you a better quality of life. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to PAH treatment. Your provider will work with you to decide the best treatment for your specific needs. Your individualized treatment plan for PAH may include: Balloon atrial septostomy (BAS). This procedure typically treats babies with congenital heart defects, but it’s also sometimes used for adults with PAH. A septostomy helps take pressure off the right side of your heart and also allows more oxygen to circulate in your blood. It may serve as a bridge to a lung transplant. Calcium channel blockers. These medications help lower the blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries and throughout your body. Diuretics. These “water pills” get rid of extra fluid in your body and reduce swelling. Oxygen therapy. You may need this treatment if you don’t have enough oxygen in your blood. Supplemental oxygen can help people during rest, sleep or exercise. Pulmonary vasodilators. These medications help your pulmonary arteries relax and open up better. This relieves the strain on your heart and helps ease your symptoms. A last resort option for some people with severe PAH is a lung transplant. This surgery may give you one or two new lungs. A heart-lung transplant gives you a new heart as well. What medications treat pulmonary arterial hypertension? Medications that treat PAH come in several different forms: Oral. To help the blood vessels in your lungs relax, and to prevent them from becoming narrow. These medications may help you be more physically active. Inhaled: To treat shortness of breath. Portable infusion pump: To open up your blood vessels so more blood can flow through. This can help improve your symptoms. Intravenous (IV): To open up your blood vessels and relieve symptoms like chest pain and trouble breathing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following drugs for people with PAH: Ambrisentan (oral). Bosentan (oral). Epoprostenol (IV). Iloprost (inhaled). Macitentan (oral). Riociguat (oral). Selexipag (oral). Sildenafil (oral). Tadalafil (oral). Treprostinil (oral, inhaled, infusion pump, IV). Side effects of PAH medication Common side effects of drugs that treat PAH include: Feeling lightheaded or like you might faint. Flushing (feeling warm in your head, neck or arms). Gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Headache. Hypotension (low blood pressure). Pedal edema (swelling in your feet and ankles). Rash. Upper respiratory congestion. Specific drugs may have additional side effects. Talk with your provider about how to manage any side effects. In some cases, your provider may need to adjust your dosage. Can pulmonary arterial hypertension be reversed? Currently, medications can slow down PAH progression but not reverse the damage already done. However, researchers are working on promising new medications that could help reverse PAH. Such medications would repair damage to the endothelial cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Talk with your provider to learn more about the latest research and clinical trials for PAH therapies. Outlook / Prognosis OF Pulmonary arterial hypertension Thanks to advances in treatment, people with PAH can live longer than ever before. Your life expectancy depends on many factors, including the severity of your condition and how early you’re diagnosed. Talk with your provider to learn your specific prognosis. It’s important to keep up with your treatment and also closely follow your provider’s guidance. Steps you can take to improve your outlook include: Create an emergency kit. You need to have certain supplies and information with you all the time. Ask your provider what you should include in your kit, and never leave home without it. Get your seasonal vaccines as your provider recommends. It’s important to protect yourself against the flu and pneumonia. Keep all your follow-up appointments. Regular testing is crucial to check your lung and heart function and measure treatment progress. Take your medications as your provider prescribes, and at the same time every day. Don’t make any changes to your medication routine unless your provider tells you to do so. Prevention OF Pulmonary arterial hypertension Risk factors for developing PAH include: Connective tissue disease. Down syndrome. Family history of pulmonary hypertension. HIV. Use of diet medications such as “fen-phen” (dexfenfluramine and phentermine). Use of street drugs. If someone in your biological family has PAH, ask your provider about genetic testing. If you’re diagnosed with PAH, you may want to tell your family members so they can consider genetic testing. Some risk factors for PAH (like genetic mutations) are beyond your control. However, avoiding street drugs can help lower your risk of PAH and many other health problems. Also, talk with your provider before taking any diet pills. Depending on your risk factors, your provider may recommend preventive screenings for PAH. Living With Pulmonary arterial hypertension Follow your provider’s guidance for any lifestyle changes you should make. In general, some tips include: Avoid hot tubs, saunas and traveling to areas at a high altitude. Consider birth control options. Pregnancy can be dangerous for people with PAH. Talk with your provider if you’re planning a pregnancy or could become pregnant. Exercise and stay active as much as you can. Talk with your provider about which exercises are safe for you and how much activity you should aim to get each day. Check with your provider before starting any new exercise routine. Follow a heart-healthy diet. This includes eating foods low in saturated fat, trans fat and sodium. Quit smoking and using tobacco products. Also, avoid secondhand smoke. Seek support, and don’t try to handle your PAH journey alone. Ask your provider to recommend support groups and resources. WHEN TO CALL A DOCTOR Call your provider if you’re having problems with: A fast heart rate (120 beats per minute). A respiratory infection or cough that’s getting worse. Constantly feeling dizzy or lightheaded. Episodes of chest pain or discomfort with physical activity. Extreme fatigue or decreased ability to do your normal activities. Nausea or lack of appetite. Restlessness or confusion. Shortness of breath that’s gotten worse, especially if you wake up feeling short of breath. Swelling in your ankles, legs or stomach that’s gotten worse. Trouble breathing with regular activities or at rest. Weight gain (2 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in one week). Go to the emergency department or call your local emergency number if you have: A fast heart rate (120-150 beats per minute) that won’t go down. Fainting spells with loss of consciousness. Complications with your IV or infusion pump. These include infection, catheter displacement, solution leak, bleeding and IV pump malfunction. Shortness of breath that doesn’t go away when you rest. Sudden and severe chest pain. Sudden and severe headache. Sudden weakness or paralysis in your arms or legs. Differential Diagnoses OF Pulmonary arterial hypertension Aortic Stenosis Atrial Myxoma Atrial Septal Defect Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic Pulmonary Embolism Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) Emphysema Hepatopulmonary Syndrome Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Interstitial Lung Disease Mitral Regurgitation Mitral Stenosis Obesity-Hypoventilation Syndrome Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Restrictive Lung Disease Ventricular Septal Defects Epidemiology OF Pulmonary arterial hypertension The overall prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is difficult to determine given the disease’s heterogeneity and likely underdiagnosis. Worldwide, schistosomiasis is likely the most prevalent cause of PAH, with studies suggesting that over 7% of patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis have pulmonary hypertension. However, data registries in countries most burdened by schistosomiasis-related PAH are limited. Data registries in areas without endemic schistosomiasis such as the United States and Europe report a PAH prevalence ranging from 6.6-26 cases per million adults. The majority of these cases are idiopathic. While approximately 10% are classified as heritable, it is likely that this number will increase with time as genetic testing becomes more widespread. Studies have also estimated the prevalence of specific subgroups of PAH. An observational study of 277 patients with HIV infection found that 0.46% of patients had pulmonary hypertension. In comparison with prior studies, no change in prevalence rate was seen with modern highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). In scleroderma patients, the incidence has been estimated to be 6-60% of all patients, with the variance based on the extent of disease. Women are more likely to have PAH, with registries reporting a 65-80% female predominance of the disease. Interestingly, while prior studies suggested a mean age of diagnosis in the thirties, current registries suggest a mean age of diagnosis in the fifties. Although PAH can affect all races, data from the US REVEAL registry suggest a white predominance (73% white vs 12% African American, 9% Latino, and 3% Asian) Staging OF Pulmonary arterial hypertension pulmonary hypertension may be divided into the following functional classes: Class I: These are patients with pulmonary hypertension but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near-syncope in patients. Class II: These are patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. The patients are comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near-syncope. Class III: These are patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. Patients are comfortable at rest, but even less-than-ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near-syncope. Class IV: These are patients with pulmonary hypertension who are unable to perform any physical activity without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right-sided heart failure, dyspnea or fatigue may even be present at rest, and discomfort is increased by any physical activity. Guidelines Summary OF Pulmonary arterial hypertension Among the key changes were a lowered cutoff from mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) >25 mm Hg. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is now defined by a mPAP >20 mm Hg at rest. The definition of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) also implies a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) >2 Wood Units and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ≤15 mm Hg. Diagnosis The diagnostic algorithm was also restructured so that the diagnosis is made earlier. The following three steps are now included in the algorithm : Step 1: Suspicion by a general practitioner or other primary care provider. Step 2: Detection by echocardiography. Step 3: Confirmation with right heart catheterization in a pulmonary hypertension center. If the patient probably has intermediate or high-risk pulmonary hypertension, then he or she should be referred to a pulmonary hypertension center for a comprehensive diagnostic workup and invasive assessment, as needed. Risk Assessment Risk assessment based on a multiparametric approach using a three-strata model to classify patients at low, intermediate, or high risk of death has been updated with 1 year mortality rates in the intermediate- and high-risk groups increased to reflect new data. The estimated 1-year mortality rates are as follows: Low Risk: < 5% Intermediate-risk: 5%-20% High risk: >20%. Key recommendations for evaluating PAH disease severity and risk of death include : PAH severity should be evaluated using data derived from clinical assessment, exercise tests, biochemical markers, echocardiography and hemodynamic evaluation At diagnosis, the three-strata model taking into account all available data including hemodynamics should be used to classify patients at low, intermediate, or high risk of death; during follow-up, a four-strata model (low, intermediate-low, intermediate-high, high) should be used based on World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC), 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) and brain natriuretic peptide/N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP/NT-proBNP) along with any needed additional variables as needed. Obtaining and maintaining a low-risk profile is a treatment goal Treatment Although PAH may be diagnosed in patients with mPAP >20 mmHg and PVR >2 WU, there is no data are available for the efficacy of drugs approved for PAH in patients whose mPAP is < 25 mmHg and whose PVR is < 3 WU. Thus, the guidelines recommend treatment be initiated in patients with PAH and mPAP >25 mm Hg. General PAH treatment recommendations include the following [22] : Patients receiving medical therapy should receive supervised exercise training Psychosocial support should be provided Patients should receive vaccinations against influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and SARS-CoV-2 Patients with signs of RV failure and fluid retention should receive diuretic therapy Patients with arterial blood oxygen pressure < 8 kPa (60 mmHg) should receive long-term oxygen therapy Iron-deficiency anemia should be treated Anticoagulation is not routinely recommended but may be considered in select patients The use of ACEis, ARBs, ARNIs, SGLT-2is, beta-blockers, or ivabradine is not recommended in the absence of comorbidities (i.e. high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, left HF, or arrhythmias) Patients with arterial blood oxygen pressure < 8 kPa (60 mmHg) at sea level or those using oxygen should receive oxygen administration while in-flight Criteria lung transplantation evaluation referral in patients with PAH: PAH intermediate–high or high risk of 1 year mortality or REVEAL risk score >7 while on appropriate PAH medication Progressive disease or recent hospitalization for worsening PAH Need for IV or subcutaneous prostacyclin Known or suspected high-risk variant, systemic sclerosis or large and progressive pulmonary artery aneurysms Signs of secondary liver or kidney disfunction or other life-threatening complications Guidelines criteria lung transplantation listing in patients with PAH are as follows: Patient has received full evaluation and is prepared for transplantation PAH high risk of 1 year mortality or REVEAL risk score >10 while on appropriate PAH medication, including IV or subcutaneous prostacyclin Progressive hypoxemia, especially in patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (POVD) or pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) Progressive but not yet end-stage liver or kidney dysfunction or life-threatening hemoptysis PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANWERS ON Pulmonary arterial hypertension Q1. What is pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)? Answer: PAH is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in your lungs and the right side of your heart. It occurs when the small arteries in the lungs become narrowed, blocked, or destroyed, making it harder for blood to flow through. This increases pressure in the pulmonary arteries and forces the heart to work harder. Q2. What causes PAH? Answer: PAH can be idiopathic (no known cause), hereditary (genetic mutations such as BMPR2), or associated with other conditions like connective tissue diseases (e.g., scleroderma), HIV infection, congenital heart disease, or certain drugs and toxins. Q3. What are the common symptoms of PAH? Answer: Symptoms often include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, and swelling in the legs or abdomen. Symptoms usually worsen gradually and may initially occur only during physical activity. Q4. How is PAH diagnosed? Answer: Diagnosis involves multiple tests: Echocardiogram: to estimate pulmonary artery pressure and evaluate heart function. Right heart catheterization: the gold standard to measure pulmonary artery pressures directly. Pulmonary function tests, blood tests, chest imaging, and exercise tests help identify causes and assess severity. Q5. What treatments are available for PAH? Answer: Treatment depends on severity and cause but may include: Medications: endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, prostacyclin analogues, and soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators. Supportive care: oxygen therapy, diuretics for fluid retention, and anticoagulants if indicated. Advanced options: lung transplantation or surgical procedures for specific cases like chronic thromboembolic disease. Q6. Are there side effects of PAH medications? Answer: Yes, common side effects include headache, flushing, nausea, jaw pain, swelling, and low blood pressure. Your healthcare team will monitor and manage side effects carefully. Q7. Can I exercise with PAH? Answer: Moderate, supervised exercise is generally encouraged to maintain strength and quality of life. However, strenuous activity or overexertion should be avoided. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs can help tailor safe exercise plans. Q8. How often will I need follow-up and testing? Answer: Regular follow-up every 3 to 6 months is typical, including repeat echocardiograms and clinical assessments. Right heart catheterization may be repeated if symptoms worsen or treatment changes. Q9. Is PAH hereditary? Should my family be tested? Answer: Some forms of PAH are hereditary, especially those involving BMPR2 gene mutations. Genetic counseling and testing may be recommended for family members if a hereditary form is suspected DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Pulmonary arterial hypertension Doctor: Hello! How have you been feeling since your last visit? Patient: I’ve been feeling more tired and short of breath lately, especially when I walk or do simple chores. Doctor: I’m sorry to hear that. These symptoms are common in PAH, and it’s important we address them. Can you tell me more about how your daily activities have been affected? Patient: It’s been harder to keep up with my usual routine. Sometimes I feel dizzy, and I worry about fainting. Doctor: That’s understandable. PAH causes increased pressure in the blood vessels of your lungs, making your heart work harder. This can cause symptoms like breathlessness, fatigue, and dizziness. Patient: Are there treatments that can help me feel better? Doctor: Yes. We have several medications that can reduce the pressure in your lungs and improve your heart function. For example, drugs like endothelin receptor antagonists or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Some patients also use pumps that deliver medication continuously. Patient: Will I need to take these medicines for life? Doctor: PAH is a chronic condition, so treatment is ongoing. Our goal is to control your symptoms, slow disease progression, and improve your quality of life. We will monitor you closely and adjust treatment as needed. Patient: Are there side effects I should watch for? Doctor: Each medication has potential side effects, such as headache, flushing, or swelling. We will discuss these in detail and monitor you regularly to manage any issues. Patient: What about exercise? Can I still be active? Doctor: Moderate, supervised exercise is beneficial and encouraged. We’ll tailor an activity plan that suits your abilities and helps maintain your strength without overexertion. Patient: Should I see a specialist for this? Doctor: Yes, managing PAH is complex and is best done with a team experienced in this condition. I’ll refer you to a pulmonary hypertension center where you can get comprehensive care. Patient: Is there anything I can read or websites you recommend? Doctor: Absolutely. The Pulmonary Hypertension Association website (phassociation.org) and the American Lung Association (lung.org) have excellent resources. I’ll also give you printed materials to take home. Patient: Thank you. It helps to know there are options and support. Doctor: You’re welcome. Remember, we’re here to support you. Please reach out anytime you have questions or concerns.

It causes atypical links between arteries and veins called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The most common sites AVMs affect are the skin, nose, digestive system, lungs, brain and liver. AVMs may get larger over time. They can bleed or burst. This can result in serious complications, including death. Nosebleeds that happen for no known reason are the most common symptom. Nosebleeds can happen every day. Ongoing bleeding from the nose and the intestinal tract can result in serious iron deficiency anemia and poor quality of life. Also called Osler-Weber-Rendu disease and HHT, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia passes from parents to children. How bad it is can vary greatly from person to person, even within the same family. If you have HHT and have children, you may want to have them checked for the condition. HHT can affect them even if they don\\'t have symptoms. Causes hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) HHT is genetic, meaning it’s passed down from parents to children. It’s a dominant disorder, caused by one copy of one abnormal gene from one parent. Hundreds of possible mutations in six different genes have been linked to HHT, but the vast majority of cases are due to mutations in two genes, ENG and ACVRL1. Scientists are still studying the mutations and genes involved. Symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) The symptoms of HHT vary from person to person, depending on where abnormal blood vessels develop in the body. Some people may have no significant signs, but others may develop very serious symptoms. The most common symptom is frequent nosebleeds (epistaxis). Some people with HHT also might have delicate red spots on certain parts of the body. They may get lighter when you press on them and are common on the: Face. Fingers or fingertips. Hands. Lining of the mouth. Lips. Nose. Some people with HHT may also have: Anemia (not enough red blood cells). Bleeding in the stomach or intestines. People with HHT may develop abnormalities in larger blood vessels, called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). AVMs can form in the lungs, brain, spinal cord and liver, and they can cause: Blue discoloration of the skin. Coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Fatigue. Headaches. Trouble breathing (dyspnea). Rare but serious complications can occur when an AVM hemorrhages, such as: Dizziness, double vision, seizures and strokes, if the condition affects blood vessels in the brain. Heart failure, as the heart works harder to provide blood throughout the body, if HHT affects the liver. Back pain or numbness in the arms or legs, if HHT affects the spine. If you have HHT, there is a 50% chance for each child to inherit it. Risk factors OF HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA The major risk factor for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is having a parent with the condition. Diagnosis OF HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA Your healthcare professional may diagnose HHT based on a physical exam, results of imaging tests and a family history. But some symptoms may not show up in children or young adults. Having genetic testing for HHT may confirm the diagnosis. Imaging tests In HHT, atypical links called arteriovenous malformations, also called AVMs, happen between arteries and veins. HHT AVMs can be present in internal organs such as the lungs, brain and liver. One or more of the following imaging tests can help find AVMs: Ultrasound. This test can show whether the AVMs affect the liver. MRI. This scan can check for AVMs in the brain as well as the liver and other organs in the belly. Echocardiogram bubble study. During this echocardiogram test, a healthcare professional puts a line in a vein, called an IV. A small amount of air bubbles put into the IV lets the healthcare professional find and assess any lung AVMs. CT scan. These can confirm AVMs in the lungs, the liver and other organs in the belly. Treatment OF HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA If you or your child has HHT, if you can, seek treatment at an HHT Center of Excellence. HHT is a rare condition that is best managed at centers that treat all aspects of this condition at every age. So it can be hard to find a specialist to treat it. In the United States, Cure HHT names HHT Centers of Excellence for being able to diagnose and treat all aspects of the condition. Mayo Clinic is an HHT Center of Excellence and cares for many people and their family members diagnosed with HHT. Medications Medicines that help stop the bleeding linked with HHT can be divided into three broad groups: Hormone-related drugs. Medicines that have estrogen can be helpful. But side effects are common with the high doses needed. Anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen (Soltamox) and raloxifene (Evista) also can control HHT. Medicines that block blood vessel growth. One treatment for HHT is bevacizumab (Avastin). Avastin goes through a tube in a vein, called intravenous. Other medicines healthcare professionals use to block blood vessel growth include pazopanib (Votrient), pomalidomide (Pomalyst) and tacrolimus (Prograf, Protopic, others). Medicines that slow clot dissolving. Tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron, Lysteda) can help stop serious bleeding in emergencies. If taken regularly, it may help prevent bleeding. If you get iron deficiency anemia, you might get an iron replacement through a vein. This most often works better than taking iron pills. Surgical and other procedures for the nose Serious nosebleeds are one of the most common signs of HHT. These sometimes happen daily. They can cause so much blood loss that you become anemic. You might need to receive blood, called a transfusion, and iron through an arm vein. Procedures to lower the number of nosebleeds and lessen how bad they are may include: Ablation. This procedure uses energy from lasers or other devices to seal the vessels that cause the nosebleeds. But this most often is short-lived. The nosebleeds come back over time. Skin graft. Skin from another part of the body can be put inside the nose. The skin most often comes from the thigh. Healthcare professionals rarely do this procedure anymore because of how well newer medicines work. Surgically closing the nostrils. If nothing else works, joining flaps of skin within the nose to close the nostrils often is a success. This is done only when other treatments have failed. Healthcare professionals rarely do this procedure anymore because of how well newer medicines work. Surgical and other procedures for the lungs, brain and liver HHT most often affects the lungs, brain and liver. Procedures to treat AVMs in these organs may include: Embolization. In this procedure, a healthcare professional threads a long, slender tube through the blood vessels to the AVM. Then the health professional puts in a plug or a metal coil to block blood from entering the AVM. This shrinks and heals the AVM over time. Embolization treats lung and brain AVMs, but not liver AVMs. Surgical removal. Rarely, the best way to treat certain AVMs in the brain or the lungs is to remove them with surgery. Stereotactic radiotherapy. This procedure treats AVMs in the brain. It uses beams of radiation that come from different directions. They meet at the AVM to treat it. Liver transplant. Rarely, treatment for AVMs in the liver is a liver transplant. Drug treatments for Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and their common side effects 1. Antifibrinolytic Drugs Examples: Tranexamic acid, Aminocaproic acid Use: Help reduce bleeding by preventing clot breakdown, often used for nosebleeds and gastrointestinal bleeding. Side Effects: Risk of thrombosis (blood clots) Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea) Rare allergic reactions 2. Antiangiogenic Drugs Examples: Bevacizumab (Avastin), Pomalidomide, Pazopanib Use: Inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth and reduce bleeding severity. Bevacizumab is given intravenously; pomalidomide is oral. Side Effects: Bevacizumab: Hypertension, proteinuria, impaired wound healing, increased risk of bleeding or thrombosis Pomalidomide: Fatigue, constipation, risk of blood clots, neutropenia (low white blood cells) Pazopanib: Hypertension, liver toxicity, diarrhea, fatigue 3. Hormone-Related Drugs Examples: Estrogen-based therapies, Tamoxifen, Raloxifene Use: Used to reduce epistaxis frequency and severity by stabilizing blood vessels. Side Effects: Estrogens: Risk of thromboembolism, breast tenderness, nausea Tamoxifen/Raloxifene: Hot flashes, risk of blood clots, uterine changes (rare) 4. Immunosuppressants / Immunomodulators Examples: Sirolimus, Tacrolimus Use: Emerging therapies that may reduce bleeding by modulating vascular inflammation and repair. Side Effects: Sirolimus: Mouth ulcers, increased infection risk, hyperlipidemia Tacrolimus: Kidney toxicity, hypertension, tremors 5. Antibiotics Example: Doxycycline Use: Sometimes used for anti-inflammatory effects or infection prevention in HHT patients. Side Effects: Photosensitivity Gastrointestinal upset Rare allergic reactions Lifestyle and home remedies OF HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA To help prevent HHT nosebleeds, you may want to: Not use certain medicines. Your risk of bleeding can be higher from using certain medicines and drugs you get without a prescription. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), fish oil supplements, ginkgo and St. John\\'s wort. Not eat certain foods. In some people, having blueberries, red wine, dark chocolate or spicy foods can cause HHT nosebleeds. Try keeping a food diary to see if there\\'s any link between what you eat and how bad your nosebleeds are. Keep your nose moist. Use saline sprays, lotions or gels that add moisture to help lower the risk of bleeding. Using a bedside humidifier overnight also is helpful. Not do heavy lifting. Bending over and lifting heavy objects can cause nosebleeds. Outlook / Prognosis OF HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA People with HHT have an almost average life expectancy. But AVMs in the lungs and brain and chronic bleeding are serious and should be treated. Prevention OF HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA There is no way to prevent HHT or reduce your risk of getting it. But tell your healthcare provider if your parent, sibling or child has it. That may help you catch it early and prevent complications. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA Q1. Should anyone in my family get tested? A. Yes. Because HHT is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, all first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) of a person diagnosed with HHT should be offered genetic testing or clinical screening, even if they have no symptoms. Genetic testing helps identify family members who carry the mutation early, allowing timely monitoring and treatment to prevent complications. Q2. Can I play sports? A. Generally, you can participate in most sports and physical activities, but it is important to avoid activities with a high risk of trauma or injury that could cause bleeding, especially if you have fragile blood vessels or a history of nosebleeds or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Discuss your specific situation with your healthcare provider to tailor recommendations. Q3. Should I avoid any particular activities? A. Avoid activities that increase the risk of head trauma or severe nosebleeds, such as contact sports or heavy weightlifting. Avoid high-altitude exposure without medical advice, as low oxygen levels can worsen AVMs. Avoid activities that increase bleeding risk if you have known AVMs or bleeding tendencies. Q4. Should I avoid alcohol, certain foods or any medications? A. Alcohol can dilate blood vessels and may worsen nosebleeds, so moderation or avoidance is advised if you have frequent epistaxis. Avoid medications that increase bleeding risk such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and anticoagulants unless prescribed and closely monitored by your doctor. No specific food restrictions are generally required, but maintaining good nutrition and hydration supports vascular health. Q5. What can I do to prevent or stop nosebleeds? A. Keep nasal mucosa moist using saline sprays, gels, or humidifiers. Avoid nasal trauma (e.g., nose picking). Use gentle nasal hygiene. In recurrent or severe cases, treatments such as laser therapy, cauterization, or topical medications may be recommended by an ENT specialist. Some patients benefit from systemic therapies like antifibrinolytics or antiangiogenic drugs under specialist care. Q6. Is it safe for me to get pregnant? A. Pregnancy in women with HHT carries increased risks due to potential complications from AVMs (especially in the lungs and brain) and bleeding. It requires specialized multidisciplinary care with close monitoring by obstetricians experienced in high-risk pregnancies and HHT specialists. Pre-pregnancy screening for AVMs is strongly recommended. Q7. When should I seek medical attention for bleeding? A. Seek urgent medical care if you experience: Severe or uncontrollable nosebleeds lasting more than 20 minutes despite first aid. Signs of significant blood loss such as weakness, dizziness, fainting, or rapid heartbeat. Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract (vomiting blood or black stools). Symptoms suggestive of AVM complications like sudden severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or neurological symptoms Diagnostic Considerations OF HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA The diagnosis of Osler-Weber-Rendu disease (OWRD; i.e., hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [HHT]) for the purposes of improving patient care and standardizing research. These criteria are as follows: Epistaxis - Spontaneous and recurrent Telangiectases - Multiple characteristic sites (e.g., lips, oral cavity, fingers, or nose) Visceral lesions - Gastrointestinal (GI) telangiectasia (with or without bleeding), pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM), hepatic AVM, cerebral AVM, and spinal AVM Family history - A first-degree relative who has HHT (according to these same criteria) The HHT diagnosis is classified as definite if three criteria are present, possible or suspected if two criteria are present, and unlikely if fewer than two criteria are present. There is no firm consensus on the number of episodes or degree of epistaxis necessary for diagnosis; according to the Curaçao criteria, nosebleeds should occur spontaneously on more than one occasion, and night-time bleeding should be considered especially suspicious. Early diagnosis of family members or confirmation with genetic testing of patients who meet the Curaçao criteria may assist in the identification of those patients who are most at risk for specific sequelae. In addition to the conditions listed in the differential diagnosis, other problems to be considered include the following: Cockayne syndrome Louis-Bar syndrome Essential telangiectasia Actinically damaged skin (actinic keratosis) Scleroderma Differential Diagnoses OF HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA Ataxia-Telangiectasia CREST Syndrome Pediatric Syphilis Rosacea Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome Epidemiology OF HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA United States statistics OWRD (ie, HHT) is rare in North America. The reported incidence is 1-2 cases per 100,000 population annually. The overall prevalence is estimated to be approximately 1-2 cases per 10,000 population. However, the prevalence may be underestimated because many cases may be asymptomatic. In Vermont, the frequency has been estimated at 1 case per 16,500 population. The disease has a clinical penetrance of 97%. International statistics The worldwide prevalence is 1 case per 5000-10,000 population In Europe and Japan; the frequency is estimated to be between 1 in 5000 to 8000 people. The prevalence of HHT in a Danish population increased from 13.8 cases per 100,000 population in 1974 to 15.6 cases per 100,000 population in 1995. The frequency may vary considerably between populations. The highest rates are seen in parts of the Dutch Antilles among the Afro-Caribbean population, with a prevalence of between 1 case per 200 persons and 1 per 1331 persons in the Curaçao and Bonaire regions. In the French department of Ain, the prevalence is 1 case per 2351 persons; in France overall, it is 1 per 8345. Other examples include the Danish island of Funen (1 per 3500) and northern England (1 per 39,216). Age-, sex-, and race-related demographics HHT may occur in children, in whom a tendency to bleed may be the first symptom. However, it is far more common during puberty or adulthood. The syndrome most often manifests by the second or third decade of life, though it may also be clinically silent. Pulmonary AVMs may be congenital and therefore may present within the first year of life. The risk of GI tract bleeding increases in patients older than 50 years. HHT occurs with equal frequency and severity in males and females. Although it most commonly occurs in whites, it has a wide geographic distribution and has been described in people of Asian, African, and Arabic descent. Genetic Testing FOR HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA The sensitivity of molecular diagnosis is highest in probands with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of HHT. However, a substantial fraction of probands do not carry an identifiable mutation in the coding exons of either of the two responsible genes, ENG and ALK1. Targeted family-specific mutation analysis for ENG exon deletions could lead to misdiagnosis of some affected family members with HHT, as was illustrated by the findings of a study in which two distinct ENG deletions were found in a single family Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Guidelines Guidelines for the management and prevention of HHT-related symptoms and complications, were published. The guidelines included the following recommendations. Management of epistaxis To reduce HHT-related epistaxis, use moisturizing topical therapies that humidify the nasal mucosa. Consider oral tranexamic acid (TXA) for epistaxis that does not respond to moisturizing topical therapies. Consider ablative therapies (eg, laser treatment, radiofrequency ablation [RFA], electrosurgery, and sclerotherapy) for nasal telangiectasias that have not responded to moisturizing topical therapies. Consider systemic antiangiogenic agents for epistaxis that has not responded to moisturizing topical therapies, ablative therapies, or TXA. Consider septodermoplasty for epistaxis that has not responded sufficiently to moisturizing topical therapies, ablative therapies, or TXA. Consider nasal closure for epistaxis that has not responded sufficiently to moisturizing topical therapies, ablative therapies, or TXA. Management of gastrointestinal bleeding Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is recommended as the first-line diagnostic test for suspected HHT-related bleeding. Patients who meet colorectal cancer screening criteria and patients with SMAD4-HHT (genetically proven or suspected) should also undergo colonoscopy. Consider capsule endoscopy for suspected HHT-related bleeding when EGD does not reveal significant HHT-related telangiectasia. Grade the severity of HHT-related gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding according to the following proposed framework: mild (hemoglobin [Hb] goals [reflective of age, gender, symptoms, and comorbidities] met with oral iron replacement); moderate (Hb goals met with intravenous [IV] iron treatment); or severe (Hb goals not met despite adequate iron replacement, or blood transfusions needed). Use endoscopic argon plasma coagulation only sparingly during endoscopy. Consider treating mild HHT-related GI bleeding with oral antifibrinolytics. Consider treating moderate-to-severe HHT-related GI bleeding with IV bevacizumab or other systemic antiangiogenic therapy. Anemia and anticoagulation Test for iron deficiency and anemia in all adult HHT patients, regardless of symptoms, and in all pediatric HHT patients with recurrent bleeding and/or symptoms of anemia. Provide iron replacement for treatment of iron deficiency and anemia as follows: initial therapy with oral iron; IV iron replacement for patients in whom oral iron is not effective, not absorbed, or not tolerated or who are presenting with severe anemia. Provide red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the following settings: hemodynamic instability/shock; comorbidities requiring a higher Hb target; need to increase Hb acutely (eg, before surgery or during pregnancy); and inability to maintain adequate Hb despite frequent iron infusions. Consider evaluation for additional causes of anemia in the setting of an inadequate response to iron replacement. Provide HHT patients with anticoagulation (prophylactic or therapeutic) or antiplatelet therapy when there is an indication, with individualized bleeding risks taken into consideration; bleeding in HHT is not an absolute contraindication for these therapies. Where possible, avoid the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and/or a combination of antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation. Liver vascular malformations Offer screening for liver vascular malformations (VMs) to adults with definite or suspected HHT. Perform diagnostic testing for liver VMs in HHT patients with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of complicated liver VMs, using Doppler ultrasonography (US), multiphase contrast computed tomography (CT), or contrast abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Provide intensive first-line management only for patients with complicated and/or symptomatic liver VMs, and tailored such management to the type of liver VM complication(s). It is recommended that HHT patients with high-output cardiac failure and pulmonary hypertension be comanaged by the HHT Center of Excellence and an HHT cardiologist or a pulmonary hypertension specialty clinic. Estimate the prognosis of liver VMs using available predictors so as to identify patients in need of closer monitoring. Consider IV bevacizumab for patients with symptomatic high-output cardiac failure due to liver VMs who have not responded sufficiently to first-line management. Refer patients with symptomatic complications of liver VMs (eg, refractory high-output cardiac failure, biliary ischemia, or complicated portal hypertension) for consideration of liver transplantation. Pediatric care Offer diagnostic genetic testing for asymptomatic children of a parent with HHT. Screen for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in asymptomatic children with HHT or at risk for HHT at the time of presentation/diagnosis. Treat large pulmonary AVMs and pulmonary AVMs associated with reduced oxygen saturation in children. Repeat pulmonary AVM screening in asymptomatic children with or at risk for HHT, typically at 5-year intervals. Screen for brain VMs in asymptomatic children with HHT or at risk for HHT at presentation/diagnosis. Treat brain VMs with high-risk features. Pregnancy and delivery Discuss preconception and prenatal diagnostic options, including preimplantation genetic diagnosis, with HHT-affected individuals. Perform testing with unenhanced MRI in pregnant women with symptoms suggestive of brain VMs. For pregnant women with HHT without recent screening and/or treatment for pulmonary AVM: Asymptomatic – Perform initial pulmonary AVM screening with either agitated saline transthoracic contrast echocardiography (TTCE) or low-dose non contrast chest CT, depending on local expertise; chest CT, if performed, should be done early in the second trimester Symptoms suggestive of pulmonary AVM – Perform diagnostic testing with low-dose non contrast chest CT; this may be done at any gestational age, as clinically indicated Treatment of pulmonary AVMs should start in the second trimester unless otherwise indicated. It is recommended that pregnant women with HHT be managed at a tertiary care center by a multidisciplinary team if they have untreated pulmonary AVMs and/or brain VMs or have not been recently screened for pulmonary AVMs. Do not withhold an epidural because of a diagnosis of HHT; screening for spinal VMs is not required. Allow women with known non-high-risk brain VMs to labor and proceed with vaginal delivery; an assisted second stage may be required on a case-by-case basis. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA Doctor: Hello! I see from your records and symptoms that you may have Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, or HHT. Have you experienced frequent nosebleeds or unusual bleeding? Patient: Yes, I’ve had nosebleeds since I was a teenager, and sometimes they seem to come out of nowhere. I also noticed some small red spots on my skin. Doctor: Those red spots are called telangiectasias, which are small abnormal blood vessels common in HHT. The nosebleeds are also a classic symptom. HHT is a genetic condition that affects blood vessel formation in various parts of the body. Patient: Is this something I was born with? Can it run in families? Doctor: Yes, HHT is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning if a parent has it, there is a 50% chance of passing it on. We recommend that your close family members get screened, even if they don’t have symptoms yet. Patient: What kind of problems can HHT cause besides nosebleeds? Doctor: HHT can cause abnormal connections between arteries and veins called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in organs like the lungs, liver, and brain. These can lead to serious complications such as bleeding, anemia, or even stroke if untreated. Patient: How do you find out if I have these AVMs? Doctor: We perform screening tests such as contrast echocardiography for lung AVMs, MRI for brain AVMs, and imaging for liver involvement. Early detection helps us manage and prevent complications. Patient: What treatments are available? Doctor: Treatment depends on your symptoms and which organs are affected. For nosebleeds, we use local therapies like humidification, nasal gels, or laser treatment. For more severe bleeding, medications such as antifibrinolytics or antiangiogenic drugs like bevacizumab may help reduce bleeding. AVMs may require embolization or surgery. Patient: Are there risks with these treatments? Doctor: Like all treatments, there are potential side effects. For example, antiangiogenic drugs can cause high blood pressure or impaired wound healing. We monitor you closely and tailor treatment to your needs. Patient: Can I still live a normal life? Are there things I should avoid? Doctor: Many people with HHT live normal lives with proper management. Avoiding nasal trauma, keeping nasal passages moist, and regular follow-up are important. Also, inform your healthcare providers about your condition before surgeries or dental work. Patient: What about pregnancy? Is it safe? Doctor: Pregnancy can increase risks, especially if you have untreated AVMs. If you plan to become pregnant, we recommend thorough evaluation and close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team. Patient: Should my family get tested? Doctor: Yes, we advise genetic counseling and testing for first-degree relatives. Early diagnosis allows preventive care to reduce complications. Patient: Where can I learn more or get support? Doctor: The Pulmonary Hypertension Association and Cure HHT websites offer excellent patient resources and support groups. I’ll also provide printed materials for you. Patient: Thank you, doctor. It’s a relief to have a plan. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’ll work together to manage your condition and maintain your quality of life. Please reach out anytime with questions or concerns.

It’s due to issues with cilia, microscopic hair-like organs. Healthy cilia use wave-like motions to move cells and other substances within your body. With primary ciliary dyskinesia, cilia may: Be the wrong size. Have an abnormal shape. Be missing. Move in an uncoordinated manner. Not move. What do cilia do? Cilia line tissue in the respiratory system and other areas. Here, they help eliminate germs, waste and substances, like dust. They also play a role in the placement of developing organs in a fetis. How can nonfunctioning cilia make me sick? They can cause health issues beginning at birth or later in life, such as: Abnormal organ placement: The heart, lungs or spleen may be facing the wrong direction. They may also be on the wrong side of your body. Chronic, severe respiratory disease: Nonfunctioning cilia make it challenging to clear mucus. Instead, it builds up in your lungs and other passageways, causing infections. Fertility issues: Men with PCD are infertile. Women may experience serious pregnancy complications, such as an ectopic pregnancy. causes OF Primary ciliary dyskinesia Primary ciliary dyskinesia is passed down in families through gene abnormalities (mutations). There are dozens of mutations that can cause the disease. Symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia Symptoms are often present at birth and worsen over time. PCD symptoms at birth Congenital heart disease. Cyst-like growths on organs, including the kidneys and pancreas. Difficulty breathing (respiratory distress). Heterotaxia, organs that are out of place, missing or not fully developed. Humoral (antibody) deficiency, which can contribute to lung and sinus infections. Lungs that cannot inflate properly (atelectasis). Nasal congestion. Situs inversus, organs that are a mirror image of where they should be. Wet cough that does not go away. Ongoing primary ciliary dyskinesia symptoms Chronic cough. Chronic sinusitis. Ear infections. Excess mucus and phlegm. Infertility. Fluid buildup in the brain (hydrocephalus). Nasal polyps. Severe pneumonia. Upper respiratory infections. Diagnosis and Tests OF Primary ciliary dyskinesia There is no single test that can confirm a PCD diagnosis. Evaluations include: Physical exam to determine whether medical history and symptoms are consistent with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Biopsy of tissue that contains cilia. Healthcare providers take a tissue sample from the nose or lungs and examine it under a microscope. Genetic testing to check for mutations associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia. The majority but not all people with PCD have one of these mutations. Other tests that may indicate a primary ciliary dyskinesia diagnosis include: Exhaled nasal nitric oxide: A special device measures nitric oxide levels, a gas that’s present when you exhale. People with PCD have abnormally low levels. Pulmonary function tests: These tests evaluate how well your lungs work. Video microscopy: A healthcare provider views a sample of cilia through a microscope equipped with a high-powered video camera. Viewing video output in slow-motion enables healthcare providers to test cilia movement. Management and Treatment OF Primary ciliary dyskinesia There is no cure for PCD. But treatment can slow disease progression. Therapies that help you eliminate mucus and fluids include: Airway clearance: A special machine loosens mucus. There are also special coughing techniques. Chest physical therapy: Some people wear a vest-like device that taps on their chest. Ear tubes: Surgeons implant small tubes in the eardrums. They make it easier to clear fluid from the middle ear, lowering the likelihood of buildups. Care may also include medications for infections and inflammation: Antibiotics: These medications help your body fight infections. In severe cases, you may receive antibiotics through a vein in your arm (intravenously). Azithromycin: This medication helps treat the inflammation in your lung. You take it on a daily basis. Bronchodilators: Medications like albuterol make it easier to breathe. Corticosteroids: These medications lessen inflammation by quieting chemical reactions in your body. Mucus thinners: Medications you inhale to thin mucus in the airways. Surgery may be necessary to treat abnormal organ placement. Care may include repairing abnormal structures shortly after birth. Additional procedures may be needed to prevent or treat complications later in life. Outlook / Prognosis OF Primary ciliary dyskinesia Many people live a long life, even into older adulthood. What is the prognosis for people with primary ciliary dyskinesia? The prognosis varies. Some people are sick at birth and remain so throughout their lives. Other people feel healthy between periods of illness that may sometimes be severe. What are the potential complications of PCD? Ongoing infections from primary ciliary dyskinesia can scar organ tissue, leading to complications. These include: Hearing loss. Bronchiectasis. Respiratory failure. Prevention OF Primary ciliary dyskinesia The condition is inherited, so there is nothing you can do to prevent it. If you are thinking of starting a family and a close relative has PCD, you may wish to consider genetic testing and counseling. These services help you learn the likelihood of having a child with the disease. Living With Primary ciliary dyskinesia Steps you can take to feel your best include: Exercise: Moderate physical activity makes you breathe harder, loosening mucus and improving physical strength. Emotional support: Living with a chronic condition such as PCD can bring challenges that are difficult to cope with. A mental health professional can provide you with the support that makes life a little less stressful. Monitoring: Healthcare providers assess whether treatments are working or if symptoms are worsening. Visits may include pulmonary function testing or a chest X-ray. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF Primary ciliary dyskinesia Chronic sinopulmonary disease and bronchiectasis. Like primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), the following disorders are associated with chronic sinopulmonary disease and bronchiectasis. Unlike PCD, these disorders are not associated with situs abnormalities: Cystic fibrosis Inborn errors of immunity. Overlap is likely if associated with respiratory manifestations. Immunodeficiencies such as immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass deficiency, activated PI3K delta syndrome, and GATA2 deficiency may have low nasal nitric oxide levels in addition to overlapping clinical features with PCD. See the following Phenotypic Series for genes associated with primary immunodeficiency in OMIM: Immunodeficiency (select examples) Immunodeficiency with hyper-IgM Immunodeficiency, common variable Severe combined immunodeficiency (select examples) Bronchiectasis and nasal polyposis (OMIM 620984) may be seen in those with an autosomal recessive airway disease with respiratory symptoms and low nasal nitric oxide levels in individuals with biallelic WFDC2 pathogenic variants . Mucin deficiency due to biallelic loss of MUC5B Asthma and/or allergic rhinitis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Wegener granulomatosis (upper- and lower-airway disease) Sinopulmonary disease. Cri-du-chat syndrome (OMIM 123450) is caused by a segmental chromosome 5p deletion that usually includes DNAH5 (a gene known to be associated with PCD). PCD co-occurs in cri-du-chat syndrome when a PCD-causing pathogenic variant is detected in the remaining allele of DNAH5. Cri-du-chat syndrome is associated with chronic sinopulmonary disease but not situs abnormalities. Situs abnormalities. Multiple genes are associated with visceral heterotaxy for genes associated with this phenotype in OMIM). PCD is not likely if the affected individual has visceral heterotaxy but no associated respiratory manifestations. GENOMIC DATA OF Primary ciliary dyskinesia a heterozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant in FOXJ1 or TUBB4B, or a hemizygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant in a male in DNAAF6 (PIH1D3), RPGR, or OFD1. Note: (1) Per ACMG/AMP variant interpretation guidelines, the terms \"pathogenic variants\" and \"likely pathogenic variants\" are synonymous in a clinical setting, meaning that both are considered diagnostic and can be used for clinical decision making to \"pathogenic variants\" in this Gene Review is understood to include likely pathogenic variants. (2) Identification of variant(s) of uncertain significance cannot be used to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. Molecular Genetic Testing Molecular genetic testing approaches can include a combination of gene-targeted testing (multigene panel, targeted analysis) and comprehensive genomic testing (exome sequencing, genome sequencing). Gene-targeted testing requires that the clinician determine which gene(s) are likely involved, whereas comprehensive genomic testing does not require this. Epidemiology OF Primary ciliary dyskinesia United States statistics The prevalence of PCD is approximately 1:16,000 live births. Geographic area and consanguinity may affect the prevalence. Specific types of defects are consistent within individual families and appear to be genetically determined. Based on the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, the probability of having subsequent children with PCD is 1:4. International statistics The reported frequency is 1 per 26,000-40,000 live births. However, this is likely to be an underestimate because misdiagnosis is common. A genetic database analysis by Hannah et al estimated that the overall minimum global prevalence of PCD is at least 1 in 7554 persons. The expected frequency of PCD is higher in persons of African ancestry than in most other populations. Race-, sex-, and age-related demographics No racial predilection is reported. No sex predilection is reported. No particular age predilection is recognized; infants are born with this genetic disorder. Cases associated with dextrocardia and with respiratory symptoms are more likely to be diagnosed in early infancy. Procedures OF Primary ciliary dyskinesia Bronchoscopy reveals mucosal inflammation and mucopurulent secretions. It can also be used to confirm the reversal of bronchial anatomy in those patients with situs inversus. Examination of the ciliary ultrastructure by electron microscopy in a nasal or bronchial ciliary biopsy sample can be used as a diagnostic test. Nasal biopsy (brush or curettage) samples are obtained from inferior surface of turbinates. Electron microscopy reveals the abnormalities in the cilia. Bronchial brush biopsy demonstrates ciliary ultrastructure abnormalities using an electron microscope. Due to the varying orientation of the cilia in a biopsy specimen and resultant technical difficulties in the full analysis of cilia, a quantitative method includes assessing axonemal defects in less than perfectly oriented cilia, with dynein arms being assessed only in those cilia in which these small structures can be discerned. A review of quantitative transmission electron microscopy in 1182 patients referred for ciliary structure analysis reported confirmation of diagnosis of PCD in 242 (20%) cases. In addition to describing an algorithm including screening tests such as exhaled nasal nitric oxide, saccharine test, light microscopy, and electron microscopy, the authors describe the use of transmission electron microscopy using a rapid quantitative method. However, electron microscopy does not always exclude the diagnosis of PCD. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Primary ciliary dyskinesia Q1. What is Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD)? Answer: PCD is a rare inherited disorder caused by defects in the structure or function of cilia—tiny hair-like structures that move mucus and debris out of the lungs, sinuses, and ears. When cilia don’t work properly, mucus builds up, leading to recurrent infections and inflammation in the respiratory tract. Q2. What are the common symptoms of PCD? Answer: Symptoms often start early in life and include: Chronic wet cough Persistent nasal congestion or runny nose Recurrent ear infections and hearing problems Recurrent sinus infections Respiratory distress in newborns Chronic bronchitis or pneumonia About half of patients have situs inversus (organs reversed in the chest/abdomen). Q3. How is PCD diagnosed? Answer: Diagnosis involves a combination of: Measuring nasal nitric oxide (usually very low in PCD) High-speed video microscopy to assess ciliary motion Electron microscopy to examine ciliary ultrastructure Genetic testing for known mutations Clinical history and symptoms are also important. Q4. Is there a cure for PCD? Answer: Currently, there is no cure for PCD. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms, preventing infections, and maintaining lung function. Q5. How is PCD treated? Answer: Treatment includes: Airway clearance techniques (chest physiotherapy, breathing exercises) Antibiotics to treat lung and sinus infections Nasal saline washes and anti-inflammatory nasal sprays Monitoring lung health with sputum cultures, imaging, and pulmonary function tests In severe cases, oxygen therapy or lung transplantation may be considered. Q6. Can children with PCD live normal lives? Answer: With proper care and management, many children with PCD can lead active lives. Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary care improve outcomes. Support from specialists including pulmonologists, ENT doctors, and physiotherapists is important. Q7. Is PCD inherited? Should family members be tested? Answer: Yes, PCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Genetic counseling and testing may be recommended for family members if a diagnosis is confirmed. Q8. What should I do if my child with PCD gets worse? Answer: Contact your healthcare provider if your child has increased coughing, fever, difficulty breathing, or other signs of infection. Prompt treatment can prevent complications. Q9. Are there support resources for families affected by PCD? Answer: Yes. Organizations like the PCD Foundation and national lung health charities provide education, support groups, and resources for patients and families DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Primary ciliary dyskinesia Doctor: Hello! I’d like to talk with you about your symptoms and the possibility of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, or PCD. Have you noticed chronic cough, frequent sinus infections, or ear problems? Patient: Yes, I’ve had a persistent wet cough since I was a child, and I often get sinus infections. My ears also seem to get infected a lot. Doctor: Those are common symptoms of PCD, which is a rare inherited disorder where tiny hair-like structures called cilia don’t work properly. Normally, cilia help clear mucus and bacteria from your lungs and sinuses, but when they don’t function well, infections can become frequent. Patient: So, this is something I was born with? Doctor: Yes, PCD is genetic and usually starts early in life. Some people also have a condition called situs inversus, where their internal organs are mirrored, but not everyone has this. Patient: How do you confirm if I have PCD? Doctor: We use several tests. One is measuring nasal nitric oxide, which is typically low in PCD. We also look at the movement and structure of your cilia under a microscope, and genetic testing can identify mutations linked to PCD. Patient: Is there a cure? Doctor: There’s no cure yet, but we focus on managing symptoms and preventing lung damage. This includes airway clearance techniques, treating infections promptly with antibiotics, and regular monitoring of your lung health. Patient: Can I still live a normal life? Doctor: Many people with PCD lead active lives, especially with early diagnosis and proper care. We’ll work with a multidisciplinary team including ENT specialists, pulmonologists, and physiotherapists to support you. Patient: What should I watch out for? Doctor: Be alert for worsening cough, fever, or difficulty breathing, which may signal infections needing treatment. Also, regular follow-up is important to monitor lung function. Patient: Is this something my family should be concerned about? Doctor: Since PCD is inherited, family members might consider genetic counseling and testing, especially if they have symptoms. Patient: Thank you, doctor. It helps to understand what’s going on and what to expect. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’ll provide you with resources and support to manage your condition effectively. Please feel free to ask any questions as we go along.

Surgeons place a tracheostomy tube into the hole to keep it open for breathing. The term for the surgical procedure to create this opening is tracheotomy. A tracheostomy allows air to pass into the windpipe to help with breathing. Tracheotomy is done when the usual way of breathing is blocked or reduced. A tracheostomy is often needed when health problems require long-term use of a machine called a ventilator to help with breathing. A tracheostomy also may be needed when surgery would require breathing to be rerouted for a short time because of swelling or airway blockage in the neck or face. Rarely, an emergency tracheotomy is done when the airway is suddenly blocked, such as after a major injury to the face or neck. When a tracheostomy is no longer needed, it\\'s allowed to heal shut, or a surgeon can close it. For some people, tracheostomies stay in place for the rest of their lives. Why it\\'s done A tracheostomy may be needed when: Medical conditions make the use of a breathing machine, also known as a ventilator, necessary for an extended period, usually more than one or two weeks. Medical conditions, such as vocal cord paralysis, throat cancer or mouth cancer, block or narrow the airway. Paralysis, conditions that affect the brain and nerves, or other conditions make it hard to cough up mucus from your throat and make direct suctioning of the windpipe, also known as your trachea, necessary to clear your airway. Major head or neck surgery is planned. A tracheostomy helps with breathing during recovery. Severe injury to the head or neck blocks the usual way of breathing. Other emergency situations occur that block your ability to breathe and emergency personnel can\\'t put a breathing tube through your mouth and into your windpipe. Emergency care Most tracheotomies are done in a hospital setting. But in an emergency, emergency personnel may need to create a hole in a person\\'s throat when outside of a hospital, such as at an accident scene. Emergency tracheotomies are hard to do and have a greater risk of complications than those that are planned. A related and somewhat less risky — and more straightforward — procedure used in emergency care is a cricothyrotomy (kry-koe-thie-ROT-uh-me). This procedure creates a hole slightly higher up in the neck right below the voice box, also known as the larynx. The hole is placed right below the Adam\\'s apple, which usually looks like a bump on the throat and is made up of thyroid cartilage that covers the front of the voice box. Once a person transfers to a hospital and is stable, a tracheotomy replaces a cricothyrotomy if that person needs help breathing long term. Risks Tracheostomies are generally safe, but they have risks. Some complications are more likely during or shortly after surgery. The risk of complications is greater when a tracheotomy is done as an emergency procedure. Complications that can occur right away include: Bleeding. Damage to the windpipe, thyroid gland or nerves in the neck. Movement of the tracheostomy tube or placement of the tube that isn\\'t correct. The trapping of air in tissue under the skin of the neck. This is known as a subcutaneous emphysema. This issue can cause breathing problems and damage to the windpipe or the food pipe, also known as the esophagus. Buildup of air between the chest wall and lungs that causes pain, breathing problems or lung collapse. This is known as pneumothorax. A collection of blood, also known as a hematoma, that may form in the neck and squeeze the windpipe, causing breathing problems. Long-term complications are more likely the longer a tracheostomy is in place. These problems include: Blockage of the tracheostomy tube. Movement of the tracheostomy tube from the windpipe. Damage, scarring or narrowing of the windpipe. Development of an unusual passage between the windpipe and the esophagus. This makes it more likely that fluids or food could enter the lungs. Development of a passage between the windpipe and the large artery that supplies blood to the right arm and right side of the head and neck. This can result in life-threatening bleeding. Infection around the tracheostomy or infection in the windpipe and bronchial tubes or lungs. An infection in the windpipe and bronchial tubes is known as tracheobronchitis. An infection in the lungs is known as pneumonia. If you still need a tracheostomy after you\\'ve left the hospital, you\\'ll likely need to keep regularly scheduled appointments to watch for possible complications. You\\'ll also likely get instructions about when you should call your healthcare professional about problems, such as: Bleeding at the tracheostomy site or from the windpipe. Having a hard time breathing through the tube. Pain or a change in comfort level. A change in skin color or swelling around the tracheostomy. A change in the position of the tracheostomy tube. How you prepare How you prepare for a tracheostomy depends on the type of procedure you\\'ll have. If you\\'ll be having general anesthesia, your healthcare professional may ask that you not eat or drink for several hours before your procedure. You also may be asked to stop taking certain medicines. Plan for your hospital stay After the tracheostomy procedure, you\\'ll likely stay in the hospital for several days as your body heals. If your tracheostomy is a planned procedure, you can prepare for your hospital stay by bringing: Comfortable clothing, such as pajamas, a robe and slippers. Personal care items, such as your toothbrush and shaving supplies. Entertainment to help you pass the time, such as books, magazines or games. A communication method, such as a pencil and a pad of paper, a smartphone, or a computer, as you won\\'t be able to talk at first. Your healthcare team may give you a writing whiteboard with a marker after your tracheostomy to help you communicate during the early part of your recovery. What you can expect During the procedure A tracheotomy is most commonly done in an operating room with general anesthetic, which is medicine that puts you to sleep. Occasionally, the procedure needs to be done when you\\'re awake or lightly sedated rather than fully asleep. To do this, a surgeon uses a local anesthetic to numb the neck and throat to complete the procedure comfortably. Once the tracheostomy is completed and a tube is in place, you can then be safely put under general anesthesia to complete other parts of surgery if needed. The type of procedure you have depends on why you need a tracheostomy and whether the procedure was planned. There are basically two options: Surgical tracheotomy. A surgeon can do this procedure in an operating room or in a hospital room. The surgeon usually makes a horizontal cut through the skin at the lower part of the front of your neck. The surgeon pulls back the surrounding muscles, and a small portion of the thyroid gland is cut. This exposes the windpipe, also known as the trachea. At a specific spot on your windpipe near the base of your neck, the surgeon creates a tracheostomy hole. Minimally invasive tracheotomy. Also called a percutaneous tracheotomy, a surgeon usually does this procedure in a hospital room. The surgeon makes a small cut near the base of the front of the neck. A special lens is fed through the mouth so that the surgeon can view the inside of the throat. Using this view of the throat, the surgeon guides a needle into the windpipe to create the tracheostomy hole. Then the surgeon expands the hole to the right size for the tube. For both procedures, the surgeon inserts a tracheostomy tube into the hole. A neck strap attached to the faceplate of the tube keeps it from slipping out of the hole. Temporary sutures also can secure the faceplate to your neck. After the procedure You\\'ll likely spend several days in the hospital as your body heals. During that time, you learn the skills you need to maintain and cope with your tracheostomy, including how to: Care for your tracheostomy tube. A nurse teaches you how to clean and change your tracheostomy tube to help prevent infection and lower the risk of complications. You continue to do this as long as you have a tracheostomy. Speak. Generally, a tracheostomy prevents speaking because air goes out the tracheostomy rather than up through your voice box. But there are devices and techniques to redirect airflow enough to allow you to speak. Depending on the type of tube, width of your windpipe and condition of your voice box, you may be able to speak with the tube in place. If needed, a speech therapist or a nurse trained in tracheostomy care can help you learn to use your voice again. Eat. While you\\'re healing, swallowing will likely be hard. You\\'ll get nutrients through an IV, a feeding tube that passes through your mouth or nose, or a tube inserted directly into your stomach. When you\\'re ready to eat again, you may need to work with a speech therapist. The speech therapist can help you regain the muscle strength and coordination you need to swallow. Cope with dry air. The air you breathe will be much drier because it no longer passes through your moist nose, mouth and throat before reaching your lungs. This can cause irritation, coughing and too much mucus coming out of the tracheostomy. Putting small amounts of saline directly into the tracheostomy tube, as directed, may help loosen mucus. Or a saline nebulizer treatment may help. A device called a heat and moisture exchanger captures moisture from the air you exhale and humidifies the air you inhale. A humidifier or vaporizer adds moisture to the air in a room. Manage other effects. Your healthcare team shows you ways to care for other common effects of a tracheostomy. For example, you may learn to use a suction machine to help you clear mucus from your throat or airway. Results In most cases, a tracheostomy is needed for a short time as a breathing route until other medical issues resolve. If you don\\'t know how long you may need to be connected to a ventilator, the tracheostomy is often the best permanent solution. Your healthcare team talks with you to help decide when it\\'s the right time to take out the tracheostomy tube. The hole may close and heal on its own, or a surgeon can close it. REFERENCES Tracheostomy - Mayo Clinic Subglottic stenosis Alternative names and related terms for Subglottic Stenosis include: Subglottic narrowing Subglottic airway stenosis Subglottic obstruction Subglottic stricture Laryngotracheal stenosis (when involving both the larynx and subglottic area) Subglottic laryngeal stenosis Subglottic constriction Congenital subglottic stenosis (if present from birth) Acquired subglottic stenosis (due to trauma, intubation, infection, etc.) DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Subglottic stenosis Subglottic stenosis is when the upper section of your trachea (windpipe) is narrower than usual so that there’s a whistling noise when you breathe, or you feel short of breath. “Subglottic” means the part of your trachea just below your vocal cords and “stenosis” means there’s a narrowing. Anyone can have subglottic stenosis. Your newborn baby may be born with an unusually narrow airway (congenital subglottic stenosis). Or you could develop it after you’re born (acquired subglottic stenosis). Several things may cause subglottic stenosis in adults, but it can happen for no known reason (idiopathic subglottic stenosis). Without treatment, severe subglottic stenosis can be life-threatening. But treatment to widen the narrow area in your windpipe can effectively treat the condition. Subglottic stenosis is a rare condition, affecting 1 in every 400,000 people. Symptoms OF Subglottic stenosis Subglottic stenosis symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe, depending on the narrowness of your airway. Think of sipping water through a flexible straw. You only get a sip of water when the straw is wide open. Squeeze it a little, and there’s less to drink. The more you squeeze, the less water flows through the straw. In mild or moderate subglottic stenosis, part of your airway is narrower than usual. In severe subglottic stenosis, that part of your airway is nearly closed shut so that very little air that comes in through your nose makes it through your windpipe and into your lungs. If your baby has this condition, they may have: Stridor, which is a high-pitched whistling noise when your baby breathes in or out. Dyspnea (difficulty breathing). Recurring croup. If you or your older child has subglottic stenosis, symptoms may include: A cough that doesn’t go away or you bring up more mucus than usual when you cough. Shortness of breath (dyspnea) that doesn’t improve with inhalers or other treatments Stridor. What causes subglottic stenosis? The condition can happen if your baby’s airway is narrower than usual (congenital subglottic stenosis). A child or an adult may develop it if they: Need intubation on a ventilator. People who need intubation for more than two weeks can sometimes develop subglottic stenosis. Have an injury that damages their airway. Have a rare autoimmune disorder or vasculitis that causes scar tissue to build up in their airway. Some of the time, however, there’s no known reason why people develop subglottic stenosis. These cases tend to affect females between the ages of 30 and 60. Diagnosis and Tests OF Subglottic stenosis Your healthcare provider will perform a physical examination. They’ll ask about your medical history and your symptoms. If they suspect subglottic stenosis, they may refer you to an ear, nose and throat specialist (ENT or otolaryngologist). The specialist may perform tests, including: Flexible laryngoscopy: Your provider inserts a flexible tube down your throat. There’s a tiny camera on the tube that allows your provider to look at your larynx (voice box) and windpipe. Pulmonary function test: This test measures the amount of air that you can breathe in or out. Reduced airflow is a sign of subglottic stenosis. Computed tomography (CT) scan: Your provider may order a CT scan so they can look at the structure of your airway. Management and Treatment OF Subglottic stenosis Subglottic stenosis is rare, so there’s no standard or common treatment for it. Treatments may include checking on your condition, steroid injections and surgery. Monitoring If tests show subglottic stenosis is causing mild narrowing of your airway, your provider may schedule regular appointments so they can check your airway. They may do more tests to see if your airway is narrowing. Steroid injections Your provider may do steroid injections as initial or first-line treatment. The treatment involves injecting a steroid through your neck into your airway. (Your provider will use local anesthesia to numb your neck, airway and nose so you won’t have pain during treatment.) Typically, people who have this treatment have a series of injections every four to six weeks. Surgery for subglottic stenosis There are a few different surgical procedures to treat subglottic stenosis: Endoscopic dilation: In this treatment, your provider uses an endoscope to place a tiny balloon in the narrow area of your windpipe. The balloon dilates (stretches) the section. An endoscopic dilation isn’t a permanent solution: at some point, you’ll need to have the procedure again to keep your airway open. Cricotracheal resection: This surgery involves removing the narrowed part of your airway just below your voice box and then reconnecting your airway and voice box. Endoscopic laryngotracheoplasty: In this surgery, providers widen your airway by placing pieces of cartilage in your airway. Surgeons may call this surgery laryngotracheal reconstruction. Outlook / Prognosis OF Subglottic stenosis Often, prompt treatment can effectively treat the condition. But subglottic stenosis can come back, which means you or your child will need more treatment. When to see a doctor If you or your child has treatment for subglottic stenosis, contact your provider as soon as you notice changes or symptoms, like stridor or breathing issues, that may mean the condition is coming back. You or your child may need more treatment to prevent symptoms from getting worse. Epidemiology OF Subglottic stenosis Frequency The frequency of congenital subglottic stenosis (SGS) is unknown. The incidence of acquired subglottic stenosis (SGS) has greatly decreased since the late 20th century. In the late 1960s, when endotracheal intubation and long-term ventilation for premature infants began, the incidence of acquired subglottic stenosis (SGS) was as high as 24% in patients requiring such care. In the 1970s and 1980s, estimates of the incidence of subglottic stenosis (SGS) were 1-8%. In 1998, Choi and Zalzal reported that the incidence of subglottic stenosis (SGS) had remained constant at the Children\\'s National Medical Center in Washington, DC; it was approximately 1-2% in children who had been treated in the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU). Walner reported that, among 504 neonates who were admitted to the level III ICU at the University of Chicago in 1997, 281 were intubated for an average of 11 days, with no patients developing subglottic stenosis (SGS) over a 3-year period. Moreover, in a systematic review published in 2001, Walner et al reported a decreasing incidence of neonatal subglottic stenosis in the literature, with studies published after 1983 finding an incidence of less than 4% and studies after 1990 having an incidence of under 0.63%. In 1996, a report from France described no incidence of subglottic stenosis (SGS) in the neonatal population who underwent intubation with very small endotracheal tubes (ie, 2.5-mm internal diameter) in attempts to prevent trauma to the airway. Morbidity Using the Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID), Arianpour et al found that in addition to gastroesophageal reflux (GER), comorbidities more likely to be diagnosed in inpatients aged 20 years or younger with acquired subglottic stenosis (SGS) include trisomy 21, asthma, and additional upper airway anomalies. However, the chance of prematurity and dehydration was indicated to be lower in pediatric acquired SGS. Diagnostic Procedures OF Subglottic stenosis In a child with mild or moderate airway obstruction, perform flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy in the clinic or the emergency department (ED). If extreme airway obstruction exists or if an active supraglottic infectious process is suspected in a young child, flexible endoscopy may be deferred in favor of formal rigid bronchoscopy in the operating room (OR). However, flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy may be performed in a controlled setting in the OR, because determination of the nature of the supraglottis and glottis in awake, unsedated patients is crucial. The procedures are described as follows. Flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy During flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy, topical anesthesia and decongestion can be accomplished in older infants and children with topical Afrin and lidocaine. A 3-mm endoscope can be used, even in an infant. Pass the endoscope into both nasal cavities to access pyriform aperture stenosis, midnasal stenosis, choanal atresia or stenosis, lesions of the nose and nasopharynx, and the adenoid pad. Pass the endoscope into the superior oropharynx and hypopharynx. The hypopharynx and larynx can be assessed. Identify the structure and position of the supraglottis. Evaluate the epiglottis and arytenoids for malacia or stenosis. Evaluate the position and movement of the true vocal cords. Evaluate edema or erythema of the true vocal cords, epiglottis, and arytenoids. Flexible endoscopy This can be performed with the patient in the supine or sitting position. The supine position often results in the obstruction of certain supraglottic processes. If the goal is to obtain the best visualization of the true vocal cords and supraglottis, place a child (even an infant) in the sitting position with his or her neck extended. If the child is older, the voice can be evaluated, and videostroboscopy can be performed to assess the vocal cord waveform and vocal cord mobility. Occasionally, the subglottis can be visualized with flexible endoscopy; however, rigid laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy are the safest procedures and offer the best visualization for the subglottis and tracheobronchial tree. Rigid laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy Rigid laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy is the best single test for evaluating airway obstruction in children. The otolaryngologist must have knowledge of the pediatric airway, and the OR must have adequate bronchoscopes and telescopes of various sizes. Prepare all equipment for bronchoscopy, including laryngoscopes, light sources, video documentation equipment, telescopes, and bronchoscopes prior to the child\\'s arrival in the OR. Throughout the procedure, maintain good communication between anesthesiologists, surgical nursing staff, and physicians, so that any potential airway obstruction can be quickly assessed and addressed. Do not further injure the pediatric airway—this point is of paramount importance. Use the smallest bronchoscope or telescope alone for evaluation of the subglottis in a child who does not require ventilation throughout the procedure. This practice allows good visualization without iatrogenic injury to the area. If ventilation is required throughout the evaluation, use a bronchoscope-telescope combination. If a child has a tracheotomy or is not in extreme distress, the child can breathe spontaneously and inhale oxygen and anesthetics through an endotracheal tube in the pharynx while the airways are visualized with a laryngoscope and large telescope. Frequently, the true vocal cords are anesthetized with lidocaine prior to evaluation to help prevent laryngospasm. Determine the size of the child\\'s airway by using endotracheal tubes. As previously mentioned, Myer and Cotton established a scale for subglottic stenosis (SGS) severity that is based on the child\\'s age and the size of the endotracheal tube that can be placed in the airway with an air leak pressure of less than 20 cm of water. Evaluate the subglottis and glottis for fixation, scarring, granulation, edema, paralysis or paresis, and other abnormalities. Evaluate the distance and caliber of the stenosis. Apply the Myer and Cotton staging system only to circumferential subglottic stenosis (SGS). [27] Glottic stenosis and SGS often coexist and must be considered when reconstruction is planned. Evaluate the maturity of the stenosis. If a firm white scar is present, the stenosis is mature. If the stenosis has a granular or erythematous appearance, GERD, viral infection, allergic esophagitis, or another inflammatory process may be present. Examine the area below the subglottis into the trachea and bronchi for secondary lesions. The suprastomal area is important because pathologic stenosis or malacia can influence the choice of surgical procedure. In severe subglottic stenosis (SGS), viewing the suprastomal area requires the passage of a tiny telescope through a narrow subglottis or a telescope or bronchoscope through a tracheotomy site, if available. pediatric differential diagnosis (DDx) of subglottic stenosis Congenital subglottic stenosis: Narrowing present at birth due to thickened soft tissue or cartilage in the subglottic airway. Acquired subglottic stenosis: Often due to prolonged or repeated endotracheal intubation causing scarring and fibrosis. Laryngomalacia: Most common cause of stridor in infants, caused by floppy supraglottic structures collapsing during inspiration. Subglottic hemangioma: Vascular tumor in the subglottic region causing airway obstruction and biphasic stridor. Vocal cord paralysis: Unilateral or bilateral immobility leading to airway compromise and voice changes. Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup): Viral infection causing inflammation and narrowing of the subglottic airway. Epiglottitis: Acute bacterial infection causing supraglottic swelling and airway obstruction. Bacterial tracheitis: Severe bacterial infection causing airway inflammation and narrowing. Foreign body aspiration: Sudden onset airway obstruction with history of choking. Laryngeal webs or cysts: Congenital or acquired membranes causing partial airway obstruction. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: Autoimmune vasculitis causing subglottic inflammation and stenosis. Extrinsic airway compression: From vascular rings or masses compressing the airway externally. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Can exacerbate airway inflammation and contribute to stenosis or edema. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Subglottic stenosis 1. How severe is my child’s condition? A. The severity of subglottic stenosis (SGS) is usually graded based on how much the airway is narrowed: Mild (Grade 1-2): Less than 50% narrowing; many children may have few or no symptoms and sometimes improve as they grow. Moderate (Grade 3): 50–70% narrowing; symptoms like stridor and breathing difficulty may be more noticeable. Severe (Grade 4): More than 70% narrowing; significant breathing problems often require urgent intervention. Your doctor will determine severity through endoscopic airway evaluation and imaging. Q2. Will my child need treatment right away? A. Mild cases: Often monitored closely without immediate intervention. Many improve with growth and airway maturation. Moderate to severe cases: Usually require treatment to prevent breathing difficulties. Timing depends on symptoms and overall health. If your child has significant breathing problems or recurrent infections, more urgent treatment may be needed. Q3. What treatment do you recommend for my child? A. Treatment depends on severity and symptoms: Observation: For mild stenosis without symptoms, regular monitoring is key. Endoscopic surgery: Minimally invasive procedures like balloon dilation or laser removal of scar tissue are often used for mild to moderate stenosis. Open surgery: For moderate to severe cases, procedures like laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) or partial cricotracheal resection (PCTR) are performed to widen the airway. Tracheostomy: In some cases, a temporary tracheostomy may be needed to secure the airway before or during treatment. Your child’s care team will tailor treatment based on the grade of stenosis, airway anatomy, and your child’s overall condition. GENOMIC DATA Congenital SGS and Genetic Syndromes: Congenital subglottic stenosis is rare and can be associated with genetic syndromes such as Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and CHARGE syndrome, indicating a developmental genetic component affecting airway cartilage formation. Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis (iSGS) and Genetics: Idiopathic SGS primarily affects middle-aged Caucasian women, suggesting a possible hormonal influence rather than a classic inherited genetic disorder. Studies investigating HLA genotyping found no significant genetic association within the major histocompatibility complex, indicating that if genetic susceptibility exists, it likely lies outside the HLA locus. Familial cases are rare but reported, supporting a possible genetic or familial predisposition in some patients. Molecular Mechanisms: Emerging research points to a complex interplay of genetic susceptibility, growth factors, cytokines, fibroblast activity, hypoxia, and biomechanical stress contributing to the fibrotic scarring and airway narrowing seen in SGS DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Subglottic stenosis Doctor: Hello! I want to discuss the results of your child’s airway evaluation. The findings show that your child has subglottic stenosis, which means there is narrowing just below the vocal cords. Parent/Patient: What does that mean exactly? How serious is it? Doctor: The subglottic area is the narrowest part of the airway in children. When it’s narrowed, it can make breathing more difficult and cause symptoms like noisy breathing or stridor. The severity can vary—from mild narrowing that may improve over time, to more significant narrowing that needs treatment. Parent/Patient: What caused this? Was it something we did? Doctor: Subglottic stenosis can be congenital, meaning present from birth, or acquired, often from prolonged intubation or injury to the airway. Sometimes, we don’t find a clear cause. It’s not your fault, and we have effective treatments available. Parent/Patient: What kind of treatments are there? Will my child need surgery? Doctor: Treatment depends on how severe the narrowing is and how much it affects breathing. Mild cases might just need monitoring. Moderate cases can sometimes be treated with minimally invasive procedures like balloon dilation. More severe cases may require surgery to widen the airway. We’ll tailor the plan to your child’s needs. Parent/Patient: How soon do we need to start treatment? Doctor: If your child is having significant breathing difficulties, we’ll want to start treatment soon to prevent complications. If symptoms are mild, we can monitor closely and plan treatment accordingly. Parent/Patient: Are there risks with the treatments? Doctor: Like any procedure, there are risks such as bleeding, infection, or need for repeat treatments. But these are relatively uncommon, and we take every precaution to keep your child safe. Parent/Patient: What should I watch for at home? Doctor: Watch for worsening noisy breathing, difficulty feeding, fatigue, or bluish color around the lips. If you notice these, seek medical attention promptly. Parent/Patient: Will this affect my child long-term? Doctor: Many children do very well after treatment and can breathe normally. Some may need ongoing follow-up, but with proper care, the outlook is good. Parent/Patient: Thank you for explaining everything. What’s the next step? Doctor: We’ll schedule the appropriate treatment or monitoring and provide you with information and support. Please feel free to call anytime with questions or concerns.

The larynx (voice box) contains web-like tissue that reduces the amount of air flowing in and out of the windpipe. The web may be very thin or thick, which will determine how much the breathing is affected and may also impact the treatment method. Causes OF LARYNGEAL WEB Laryngeal web is often a congenital defect, which means it is present from birth. In some cases, laryngeal webs can form later, often after long-term intubation. Signs and Symptoms OF LARYNGEAL WEB The most common symptom is frequent shortness of breath and stridor, which includes a vibrating sound as if something is partially blocking the windpipe. Poor feeding and weak cry have been associated with these webs. Other symptoms that may occur include: Wheezing Coughing Frequent chest infections Some children also tend to raise their head or stretch their neck to open the airway as much as possible. Diagnosis OF LARYNGEAL WEB Laryngeal web often has symptoms that can look like asthma, and it can be initially misdiagnosed. When asthma medications or other treatments do not improve your child’s condition (often called refractory asthma), it is important to inform your doctor. To properly diagnose tracheal web, the following diagnostic procedures may be used: Micro laryngoscopy: A micro laryngoscopy, or microscopic laryngoscopy, uses a small, flexible telescope to look in the airway for signs of a tracheal web or partial blockage. CT scan: In some cases, a picture of the chest may be needed to look for airway abnormalities. Treatment OF LARYNGEAL WEB The goal of treatment is to remove the blockage by breaking the web, allowing the airway to open up to its full size. Depending on the severity of the web, the surgeon may do this by dilating (widening) the trachea and using a laser or cutting instrument to break the web. In some cases of a thicker web, the surgeon may recommend an open surgical approach to expand the airway. Dilation A small balloon is placed in the airway to widen or break the web. This may need to be repeated to prevent the web from coming back because of scar tissue. Surgery For some webs, the correct treatment is an open surgical procedure called a larynogofissure, opening into the larynx, generally through a midline cut through the neck. Recovery If dilation is needed, your child will spend one to two nights in the hospital until their breathing is safe. If an open neck procedure is needed, then one to two weeks is usually needed in the hospital following the operation. Long-Term Outlook Prognosis is good with a normal life span. The only noticeable long-term symptoms may be a hoarse or rough voice. Differential diagnoses (DDx) for laryngeal web Congenital laryngeal complex stenosis Laryngeal papillomatosis Subglottic cysts Laryngeal cleft Congenital subglottic stenosis Post-intubation laryngeal injury (acquired webs or stenosis) Tracheal webs Tracheomalacia Tracheal stenosis Laryngeal tumors (benign or malignant) Functional laryngeal disorders (e.g., vocal cord dysfunction) 22q11.2 deletion syndrome-associated anomalies Gastroesophageal reflux-related laryngeal inflammation Epidemiology OF LARYNGEAL WEB Frequency Approximately 15% of patients who are intubated for more than 10 days develop some degree of glottic stenosis. Ninety percent of acquired subglottic stenoses in infants and children are due to endotracheal intubation. The incidence of subglottic stenosis after intubation is reported to be 1-10%. Congenital glottic stenosis is a rare disorder and may exist as a thin membranous stenosis, as a thick anterior or posterior web, or as a complete fusion of the vocal cords. Congenital laryngeal webs are rare; one report identified 51 children with webs during a 32-year period. Sex and Race In a retrospective, multi-institutional study, Gelbard et al reported an interesting degree of homogeneity between patients with idiopathic subglottic stenosis, finding that the vast majority of the 479 patients, from 10 participating centers, were female (98%) and Caucasian (95%) Diagnostic Procedures OF LARYNGEAL WEB See the list below: Flexible fiberoptic endoscopy in the awake patient is performed to assess for supraglottic and glottic pathology such as vocal cord paralysis and laryngomalacia. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with the patient under general anesthesia remain the criterion standard of diagnosis by allowing careful evaluation of each segment of the airway: supraglottis, glottis, subglottis, and trachea. The outer diameter of the largest bronchoscope that can pass through the stenosis should be noted as well as the length of the stenotic segment, its location, thickness, and composition. Use of the telescope without the bronchoscope allows dynamic assessment. Rule out secondary sites of stenosis and palpate arytenoids for cricoarytenoid joint fixation. Laryngeal electromyography may be useful. Determine the size of the airway visually and objectively by using endotracheal tubes. An individual’s endotracheal tube size is the largest tube that permits an air leak at less than 30 cm of water pressure. Evaluate for gastroesophageal reflux (pH probe) in all surgical candidates. Assess vocal status (with the assistance of speech pathologists) preoperatively in older children and adults. Staging OF LARYNGEAL WEB The classification of glottic webs as described by Cohen is as follows: Type I is an anterior web involving 35% or less of the glottis with visible true cords and no subglottic extension. Airway and voice symptoms are mild. Type II is an anterior web involving 35-50% of the glottis. Minimal involvement of subglottis. Mild airway and voice symptoms. Type III is an anterior web involving 50-75% of the glottis with associated cricoid abnormalities. True vocal cords may not be visualized. Severe airways symptoms with marked vocal dysfunction. Airway intervention may be necessary. Type IV is a web occluding 75-90% of the glottis. True vocal cords are not identifiable. Subglottis is narrowed. The patient is aphonic. Immediate airway management is required. Posterior glottic stenosis may be defined as one of the following 4 types: (Bogdasarian and Olson). Type I is vocal process adhesion from an interarytenoid scar with a mucosally lined posterior sinus tract. Type II is a posterior commissure stenosis involving the submucosa of the posterior commissure, interarytenoid region, and internal surface of the posterior cricoid lamina. Type II and IV stenosis are posterior commissure scars involving the cricoarytenoid joint unilaterally or bilaterally, respectively. The Myer-Cotton Grading system for subglottic stenosis is the most frequently used and is based on the leak pressure, tube size, and age of the patient, as follows: Grade I - Less than 50% laryngeal lumen obstruction Grade II - 50-70% obstruction Grade III - 71-99% obstruction with an identifiable lumen present Grade IV - Complete obstruction; no lumen present DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON LARYNGEAL WEB Doctor: Hello! I want to talk with you about the diagnosis we found during your child’s airway examination. Your child has a condition called a laryngeal web, which is a thin membrane of tissue partially blocking the voice box. Parent/Patient: What does that mean? How serious is it? Doctor: The laryngeal web can vary in thickness and size. Sometimes it causes mild symptoms like a hoarse or weak voice, but if it’s thicker or covers more of the airway, it can cause breathing difficulties or noisy breathing called stridor. We’ll assess how much it’s affecting your child’s breathing and voice. Parent/Patient: How did this happen? Is it something we caused? Doctor: Laryngeal webs are usually congenital, meaning they develop before birth. Sometimes they can form after injury or prolonged intubation, but in most cases, it’s not anything caused by parents or caregivers. Parent/Patient: What treatment does my child need? Will surgery be necessary? Doctor: Treatment depends on the severity. For thin webs with mild symptoms, sometimes we just monitor closely. For thicker webs causing breathing or voice problems, surgery to remove or open the web is often recommended. We use minimally invasive techniques like laser surgery or endoscopic procedures, which are effective and safe. Parent/Patient: What can we expect after treatment? Doctor: Most children improve significantly after surgery, with better breathing and voice. We’ll follow your child closely after treatment to watch for any recurrence or complications. Parent/Patient: Are there any risks with surgery? Doctor: As with any procedure, there are some risks like bleeding, infection, or scarring, but these are uncommon. We take every precaution to minimize risks and ensure your child’s safety. Parent/Patient: What should we watch for at home? Doctor: Watch for worsening breathing difficulty, persistent hoarseness, or feeding problems. If you notice any of these, please contact us promptly. Parent/Patient: Thank you for explaining everything clearly. Doctor: You’re very welcome. We’re here to support you and your child every step of the way. Please feel free to ask any questions anytime.

These air sacs, called alveoli, have a protective membrane, but lung swelling damages that membrane. The fluid leaking into the air sacs keeps the lungs from filling with enough air. This means less oxygen reaches the bloodstream, so the body\\'s organs don\\'t get the oxygen they need to work properly. ARDS usually occurs in people who are already critically ill or have major injuries. People usually are severely short of breath — the main symptom of ARDS — within a few hours to a few days after the injury or infection that caused ARDS. Many people who get ARDS don\\'t survive. The risk of death gets higher with age and how severe the illness is. Of the people who survive ARDS, some fully recover. But others have lasting lung damage. CAUSES OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME Causes of ARDS include: Sepsis. The most common cause of ARDS is sepsis, a serious and widespread infection of the bloodstream. Severe pneumonia. Severe cases of pneumonia usually affect all five lobes of the lungs. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). People who have severe COVID-19 may get ARDS. Because COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system, it can cause lung injury and swelling that can lead to COVID-19-related ARDS. Head, chest or other major injury. Accidents, such as falls or car crashes, can damage the lungs or the portion of the brain that controls breathing. Breathing in harmful substances. Breathing in a lot of smoke or chemical fumes can lead to ARDS, as can breathing in vomit. Breathing in water in cases of near-drownings also can cause ARDS. Other conditions and treatments. Swelling of the pancreas (pancreatitis), massive blood transfusions and severe burns can lead to ARDS. Risk factors OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME Most people who get ARDS already are in a hospital for another condition. Many are critically ill. People are especially at risk if they have an infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia. They\\'re also at higher risk if they have COVID-19, especially if they also have metabolic syndrome. People who have alcohol use disorder or who use recreational drugs or smoke ― lifestyle habits that can harm the lungs ― are at higher risk of getting ARDS. Having a history of alcohol, drug or tobacco use also raises the risk of ARDS. Symptoms OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME The seriousness of ARDS symptoms can vary depending on what\\'s causing them and whether there is underlying heart or lung disease. Symptoms include: Severe shortness of breath. Labored and rapid breathing that is not usual. Cough. Chest discomfort. Fast heart rate. Confusion and extreme tiredness. When to see a doctor ARDS usually follows a major illness or injury, and most people who have ARDS are already in a hospital. But if you have symptoms of ARDS and are not in a medical facility, go to the nearest emergency department right away or call 911 or your local emergency number for help. Diagnosis OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME There\\'s no specific test for ARDS. Healthcare professionals base the diagnosis on physical exams, chest X-rays and oxygen levels. It\\'s also important to rule out other diseases and conditions, such as certain heart problems that can lead to similar symptoms. Imaging A chest X-ray can show which parts of your lungs, and how much of the lungs, have fluid in them and whether your heart has gotten bigger. Another test called a CT scan combines X-ray images taken from many directions and creates cross-sectional views of internal organs. CT scans can give detailed information about the structures within the heart and lungs. Lab tests A test using blood from an artery can measure your oxygen level. Other types of blood tests can check for symptoms of infection or other medical conditions. If your healthcare professional thinks that you have a lung infection, secretions from your airway may be tested to find the cause of the infection. Heart tests Because the symptoms of ARDS are like those of certain heart problems, your healthcare professional may recommend heart tests such as: Electrocardiogram. This painless test, which also is known as an ECG, tracks the electrical activity in your heart. During the test, a healthcare professional attaches several wired sensors to your body. Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart. It shows how blood moves through the heart chambers and heart valves, and whether there are changes in the structures of your heart. Treatment OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME The first goal in treating ARDS is to improve the levels of oxygen in your blood. Without oxygen, your organs can\\'t work properly. Oxygen To get more oxygen into your bloodstream, your healthcare professional likely will use: Extra oxygen. For milder symptoms or as a short-term treatment, oxygen may be delivered through a mask that fits tightly over your nose and mouth. Mechanical ventilation. Most people with ARDS need the help of a machine to breathe. A mechanical ventilator pushes air into your lungs and forces some of the fluid out of the air sacs. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) ECMO may be an option for severe ARDS when other treatment options, such as mechanical ventilation, don\\'t work. ECMO takes over for the heart, lungs or both for a limited time while the lungs rest and heal. This treatment can help when the body can\\'t provide the tissues with enough oxygen. The ECMO machine is an artificial heart and lung, removing blood from the body through tubes and pumping the blood through the artificial lung. This process removes carbon dioxide and adds oxygen. Then the machine pumps the blood back into the body. Because of the risks involved, it\\'s important to discuss the pros and cons of ECMO with your healthcare team. Prone positioning For some people with ARDS, positioning on the stomach — what\\'s known as a prone position — during mechanical ventilation may make more oxygen available to the lungs. Fluids Carefully managing the amount of IV fluids given to people with ARDS is very important. Giving too much fluid can make more fluid build up in the lungs. Giving too little fluid can strain the heart and other organs, leading to shock. Medication OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME People with ARDS usually get medicine to: Prevent and treat infections. Ease pain and discomfort. Prevent blood clots in the legs and lungs. Reduce gastric acid reflux as much as possible. Help them feel calm or less anxious. Lung transplant When other treatments don\\'t help, lung transplant may be an option for some carefully chosen people who have ARDS. Usually, these are people who were healthy before they developed severe ARDS. Because lung transplant is such a hard process, it should be done at a center that has highly skilled, experienced surgeons and transplant teams. Lifestyle and home remedies OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME If you\\'re recovering from ARDS, these suggestions can help protect your lungs: Quit smoking. If you smoke, seek help to quit. Also, stay away from secondhand smoke whenever you can. Get vaccinated. Getting the flu, also called influenza, shot every year, as well as the pneumonia vaccine as often as recommended, can lower your risk of lung infections. Attend pulmonary rehabilitation. Many medical centers now offer pulmonary rehabilitation programs that include exercise training, education and counseling to help you learn how to get back to your usual activities and get to your ideal weight. Complications OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME ARDS can cause other medical problems while in the hospital, including: Blood clots. Lying still in the hospital while you\\'re on a ventilator can make it more likely that you\\'ll get blood clots, particularly in the deep veins in your legs. If a clot forms in your leg, a portion of it can break off and travel to one or both of your lungs, where it can block blood flow. This is called a pulmonary embolism. Collapsed lung, also called pneumothorax. In most people with ARDS, a breathing machine called a ventilator brings more oxygen into the body and forces fluid out of the lungs. But the pressure and air volume of the ventilator can force gas to go through a small hole in the very outside of a lung and cause that lung to collapse. Infections. A ventilator attaches to a tube inserted in your windpipe. This makes it much easier for germs to infect and injure your lungs. Scarred and damaged lungs, known as pulmonary fibrosis. Scarring and thickening of the tissue between the air sacs in the lungs can occur within a few weeks of the start of ARDS. This makes your lungs stiffer, and it\\'s even harder for oxygen to flow from the air sacs into your bloodstream. Stress ulcers. Extra acid that your stomach makes because of serious illness or injury can irritate the stomach lining and lead to ulcers. Thanks to better treatments, more people are surviving ARDS. But many survivors end up with potentially serious and sometimes lasting effects: Breathing problems. After having ARDS, many people get most of their lung function back within several months to several years, but others may have breathing problems for the rest of their lives. Even people who do well usually have shortness of breath and fatigue and may need extra oxygen at home for a few months. Depression. Most ARDS survivors also report going through a period of depression, which can be treated. Problems with memory and thinking clearly. Sedatives and low levels of oxygen in the blood can lead to memory loss and learning problems after ARDS. In some people, the effects may get better over time. But in others, the damage may last for the rest of their lives. Tiredness and muscle weakness. Being in the hospital and on a ventilator can cause your muscles to weaken. You also may feel very tired after treatment. Outlook / Prognosis OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME ARDS can be life-threatening and scary. But improved care and ventilator treatments — including having people lay face down (prone) to improve oxygen flow — are helping more people survive and reduce ARDS complications. The outlook is typically better in people younger than 65 and when trauma or a blood transfusion causes ARDS. Recovery from ARDS may take a long time. Most people who are taken off a ventilator can breathe freely. Some recover completely, but others may develop chronic lung problems that require care by lung specialists (pulmonologists). Can your lungs recover from ARDS? Yes, your lungs can recover from ARDS. The exact amount of time varies depending on how much lung damage you have. Most people regain their lung function within two years, although several factors go into that estimate. Prevention OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME There’s no way to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But you may be able to prevent it from being severe by seeking immediate medical attention if you have symptoms of respiratory distress, or if you have a lung injury or other disease. You can lower your risk of getting severe ARDS by quitting smoking and avoiding alcohol. Living With ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME Life after ARDS can be challenging. Have patience with yourself as you navigate recovery and lean on friends and family members for support. You may need help performing everyday tasks while your lungs regain function. Talk to your healthcare professional Common Questions Q. Are ARDS and COVID-19 the same? A. No, they aren’t the same. People with COVID-19 can develop ARDS when the virus gets into their lungs. Q. What is the survival rate for ARDS in people with COVID-19? A. Researchers are always learning more about the COVID-19 virus. Most studies conclude that the survival rate for a person with both COVID-19 and ARDS is about 50% to 60%. But many factors go determining if a person survives ARDS and COVID-19, including health history and other medical conditions. Diagnostic Considerations OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME Other conditions to be considered include the following: Oxygen toxicity Ventilator-induced lung injury Decreased capillary oncotic pressure Neurogenic pulmonary edema Postobstructive pulmonary edema (due to increased negative interstitial pressure) Fat embolism Differential Diagnoses OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME Acute Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis Afebrile Pneumonia Syndrome Airway Foreign Body Imaging Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Asthma Imaging and Diagnosis Bacterial Pneumonia Constrictive Pericarditis Drowning Empyema and Abscess Pneumonia Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Imaging Goodpasture Syndrome Heart Failure Hemosiderosis High Altitude Pulmonary Hypertension Hydrocarbon Inhalation Injury Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis Imaging Pulmonary Interstitial Emphysema Imaging Lymphangitis Meningococcal Infections Myocardial Infarction in Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome Pediatric Malignant Pericardial Effusion Pediatric Nephritis Pediatric Nonviral Myocarditis Pediatric Pneumococcal Bacteremia Pediatric Pneumonia Pediatric Idiopathic Pulmonary Artery Hypertension Pediatric Respiratory Failure Pediatric Viral Myocarditis Pediatrics, Bronchiolitis Pneumococcal Infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae) Pneumomediastinum Pneumonia in Immunocompromised Patients Pneumonia, Mycoplasma Pneumothorax Pseudomonas Infection Pulmonary Atelectasis Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary Infarction Viral Pneumonia Epidemiology OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME The incidence of ARDS is certainly lower in the pediatric population as compared to adults. The adult studies have reported a very wide range of incidence: from 17.9-86.2 per 100,000 person-years. For the population aged 15 years and older, age-adjusted incidence was 86.2 per 100,000 person-years, 38.5% hospital mortality; accounting for an estimated 190,600 cases of acute lung injury, 74,500 deaths, and 3.6 million hospital days each year in the United States. The incidence in the pediatric population is reported between 2.2 and 12.8 per 100,000 person-years. From the critical care perspective, ALI/ARDS accounts for 2.2% to 2.6% of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions, 8.3% of those receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours, and PICU and hospital mortality ranging between 18% and 32.8%. The Pediatric Respiratory Distress Incidence and Epidemiology (PARDIE) study, which involved 27 countries, found that pediatric ARDS occurs in about 3% of patients in PICUs and in about 6% of those who are receiving mechanical ventilation. In addition, among mechanically ventilated patients, the greatest number of new cases of pediatric ARDS occurred in North America, in high-income countries, and during non-summer months. The age-related statistics of ARDS can be obtained by comparing the results of two different studies from King County, Washington, USA, that were conducted around the same time between 1999 and 2000. Incidence and severity of ARDS are somewhat similar at different geographical locations. The study from Australia and New Zealand reported an incidence of 2.95 per 100,000 person-years, 2.2% of PICU admissions, and 30% of PICU mortality. A Dutch study reported an incidence of 2.2 per 100,000 person-years and 20.4% mortality. Investigators in Spain found an incidence of 3.9 per 100,000 patients-years and a PICU mortality of 26%. A German study showed incidence of 3.2 per 100,000 person-years. The incidence in the US-based study was a little higher at 12.8 per 100,000 person-years; however, mortality was slightly lower at 18%. Search of the Chinese literature revealed 2.6% of PICU admissions were for ARDS, with a mortality of 32.8%. Of note, the above reported epidemiologic data are from studies prior to the Berlin definition, a study that eliminated the category of ALI and classified ARDS as mild, moderate, and severe. Thus, the epidemiology of both ALI and ARDS has been included here. Environmental and genetic influences ARDS develops after the insult from diverse etiologies discussed above. However, the heterogeneity of susceptibility and outcomes is intriguing. This could partially be explained by environmental and genetic influences. Research is still growing in this area. From an environmental standpoint, literature from adult populations has shown increased risk of ARDS with alcohol abuse and smoking (active and passive) after blunt trauma. The association of passive smoking could be applied to the pediatric population. From a genetic standpoint, a total of 34 genes has been reported to impact ARDS susceptibility. The majority of them are linked to the currently described pathophysiological pathways of ARDS. These include inflammation, epithelial cell function, endothelial cell function, coagulation, oxidative injuries, apoptosis, and platelet cellular process. The other reported genetic mutations associated with ARDS were linked to surfactant dysfunction and to the epidermal growth factor gene polymorphism in males. There is not enough literature suggesting ethnic differences for ARDS incidence and outcomes. The vast majority of initial genetic studies were in European populations. The literature is scant for other ethnic backgrounds. Thus far, approximately nine genes in African population and three genes in Asian population have been reported to be linked with ARDS. Studies have reported poor outcomes in African Americans with ARDS as compared to patients of other ethnicities. However, in one study, higher mortality was associated with greater severity of illness on presentation in Black patients. Higher mortality in Hispanic patients was not explainable by severity of illness on presentation in the same study. Some of the epidemiologic studies have reported a slightly higher incidence of ARDS among male children (54-63%); however, the mortality (31% in male children) was not significantly different. One adult study reported higher mortality among males. There is also not enough literature in the area of genetics pertinent to pediatric ARDS in the context of growing lungs and developing immunity. practice guidelines on pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). The overarching goal is to support the patient\\'s respiratory status, while placing an utmost focus on lung protection. Deviation from these guidelines can lead to increased mortality. Ventilation strategies (1) Tidal volume (Vt) The use of physiologic tidal volumes (6-8 mL/kg) is recommended to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). If plateau and driving pressure exceed the upper limit, the use of 4-6 mL/kg might be necessary. (2) Inspiratory pressures An inspiratory plateau pressure of less than or equal to 28 cm H2O is recommended. If the chest wall compliance is reduced, it can be maintained at or below 32 cm of H2O. The driving pressure should be limited to 15 cm H2O. (3) Permissive hypercapnia (to a lower limit pH of 7.20) may be allowed in pediatric patients with ARDS in order to remain within recommended pressure and tidal volume ranges as outlined above. It is suggested that the routine use of bicarbonate supplementation be avoided. However, bicarbonate supplementation can be considered for patients in whom severe metabolic acidosis or pulmonary hypertension is adversely affecting cardiac function or hemodynamic stability. Oxygenation strategies (1) Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) Titration of PEEP to oxygenation/oxygen delivery, hemodynamics, and compliance measured under static or quasi-static conditions is suggested. It is recommended that PEEP levels be maintained at or above the lower PEEP/higher fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) table from the ARDS Network protocol. ARDS Network PEEP/FiO2 table (2) Oxygen saturation (SpO2) For pediatric patients with mild to moderate ARDS, it is suggested to maintain SpO2 between 92% and 97%. In patients with severe PARDS, an SpO2 of less than 92% can be accepted after PEEP optimization. The goal is to reduce exposure to FiO2. It is also suggested to avoid SpO2 of < 88% and > 97%. Other recommendations and good practice guidelines (1) In pediatric patients with acute respiratory failure, NIV can be tried for a limited time. HFNC or CPAP can be used in resource-limited settings. (2) A utilization of cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) is always a good practice consideration. (3) A nonroutine use of instilled saline for ETT suction can be considered. (4) Daily assessment of extubation readiness with a spontaneous breathing trial can be considered. (5) Continuous monitoring of respiratory rate, heart rate, SpO2, intermittent noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, spontaneous breathing efforts, end-tidal CO2, tidal volume, peak inspiratory pressure, plateau pressure, driving pressure, intrinsic PEEP, and flow-pressure-time curves should be considered. (6) The committee was not able to recommend in favor of or against the use of prone positioning and alveolar recruitment maneuvers. Further research is ongoing in this area. (7) The committee recommended against the use of surfactant. (8) A meticulous consideration of inhaled nitric oxide (INO) therapy is recommended in severe ARDS cases and in cases bridging to extracorporeal life support (ECLS). If INO is being utilized, a careful assessment should be made for the benefits within the first 4 hours and throughout its utilization in the course of treatment. The goal is to discontinue the treatment in the lack of benefits to minimize the toxicity. (9) Corticosteroids can be recommended in a limited population only. (10) High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) The committee was not able to recommend a routine use of HFOV in all the cases. However, it can be considered when oxygenation and ventilation are unable to be achieved on a conventional ventilator with lung protection. While the patient is on HFOV, alveolar recruitment should be achieved by stepwise increase and decrease in mean airway pressure, with continuous monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation (CO2 assessment), and its impact on hemodynamics. (11) Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) The committee was not able to recommend on any specific mode while on mechanical ventilation including controlled or assisted, APRV, or neurally adjusted ventilatory assist. (12) Airway clearance regimen The committee did not recommend the routine use of any specific mode of chest physiotherapy and mucolytic agents in patients with PARDS. (13) Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) ECLS can be considered in severe PARDS cases when lung protective strategies failed to achieve adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Potentially reversible etiologies are an important part of this consideration. A final decision should be based on a thorough evaluation by the expert team. Serial evaluations are preferable over single evaluations. Venovenous ECMO is preferred over venoarterial in patients with adequate cardiac function. Avoidance of hyperoxia and slow correction of hypercapnia are recommended. The committee was not able to provide indications and guidelines on the use of extracorporeal CO2 removal. (14) Sedation, withdrawal, and delirium A careful adjustment of minimal yet effective sedation is recommended based on serial pain, sedation, and delirium scales. The goal is to optimize oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, work of breathing, and spontaneous breathing efforts in conjunction with the aforementioned ventilator strategies. Patients with PARDS who require 5 or more days of sedation should be carefully analyzed and possibly treated for iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome. Daily assessment for delirium utilizing standardized delirium tools is recommended. Minimization of delirium using nonpharmacologic interventions, maintaining sleep hygiene, and family involvement should be carefully considered. The utilization of early mobilization and activity is suggested. The committee was not able to provide guidance for or against the use of melatonin or antipsychotics for the prevention or treatment of delirium. (14) Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) A minimal but effective NMB is recommended in addition to sedation in selected cases when protective and effective lung protective strategies can not be maintained. While utilizing NMB, train-of-four and other clinically validated tools, in addition to movements and mechanical ventilation parameters, should be monitored. (15) Early initiation (< 72 hrs) of enteral nutrition is recommended with guided protocol in conjunction with an interprofessional team approach, with a daily protein intake of at least 1.5 g/kg/day. (16) Fluid management should be adjusted to achieve adequate nutrition, oxygen delivery, and end-organ function preservation while avoiding fluid overload. (17) Transfusion threshold for packed red blood cells was reduced to a hemoglobin level of 5 g/dL in the absence of hemolytic anemia. Follow-up and long-term management (1) Patients with PARDS should be screened by a primary care pediatrician (PCP) by 3 months after discharge to assess for post-PICU morbidities, including but not limited to overall life quality, emotional and social functioning, pulmonary function tests, physical function, and cognitive and neurodevelopmental assessment, especially in patients requiring ECLS. (2) A referral to a specialist can be made in case of any deficits identified in the initial screening by the PCP. predefined Q&A about Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Q1. What is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in children? Answer: ARDS in children is a serious condition where the lungs become severely inflamed, leading to the inability to provide sufficient oxygen to the bloodstream . It is defined by acute onset hypoxemia that cannot be explained by cardiac failure . This syndrome involves a significant disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to increased permeability and pulmonary edema, which reduces gas exchange efficiency . Q2. What are the primary causes of ARDS in children? Answer: ARDS in children is most commonly caused by pneumonia, sepsis, and aspiration . Other potential causes include trauma, burns, pancreatitis, inhalational injury, transfusion, and cardiopulmonary bypass . Q3. What are the key features and symptoms of pediatric ARDS? Answer: Symptoms typically include rapid breathing and low oxygen levels . In severe cases, children may require mechanical ventilation . Diagnosis is often made through chest X-rays, blood gas analysis, and clinical evaluation of the child’s symptoms and medical history . Q4. How is ARDS treated in children? Answer: Treatment focuses on several key areas: Addressing the underlying cause: This includes treating infections (e.g., early antibiotics) or controlling inflammatory sources . Lung protective ventilation strategies: This involves using low tidal volumes, limited peak pressures, high PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure), and permissive hypoxemia and hypercapnea to minimize further lung injury . Goal-directed fluid therapy . Supportive care: Includes oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation if necessary . Rescue therapies: For severe cases not achieving adequate oxygenation, options like proning (lying face down), neuromuscular blockade, High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV), and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered on a case-by-case basis . Steroid therapy is generally advised against in all children with ARDS . Q5. What is the prognosis for children with ARDS, and are there long-term effects? Answer: The prognosis largely depends on factors such as the severity of ARDS and the child’s overall health status . Many children can recover with appropriate treatment . However, some children may experience lingering respiratory issues, decreased exercise tolerance, or psychological impacts such as anxiety or PTSD following hospitalization . Q6. What happens to the lungs at a cellular level in ARDS? Answer: ARDS involves the destruction of Type II pneumocytes, which are responsible for producing surfactant. Surfactant reduces surface tension in the alveoli and prevents their collapse. Their destruction leads to alveolar collapse and atelectasis. Lung remodeling occurs as these cells regenerate . The forces involved in mechanical ventilation can also promote inflammation and further lung injury (volutrauma, barotrauma, atelectrauma DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME Doctor: Hello. I want to discuss your child’s condition called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, or ARDS. It means that the lungs are inflamed and not working well to get enough oxygen into the blood. Parent: What causes this? Is it serious? Doctor: ARDS can happen after infections like pneumonia or sepsis, aspiration of food or liquids, trauma, or other serious illnesses. It is a serious condition but with modern treatments many children recover well. Parent: What symptoms should I expect? Doctor: Your child may breathe very fast, have difficulty breathing, or need help with oxygen or a ventilator. We often see changes on chest X-rays showing lung inflammation. Parent: What treatments will my child need? Doctor: Treatment focuses on supporting breathing and treating the underlying cause. We use gentle mechanical ventilation strategies to protect the lungs, carefully manage fluids to avoid overload, and sometimes use special therapies like prone positioning or advanced ventilation if needed. Parent: Are there risks with the treatments? Doctor: Yes, but we carefully balance the benefits and risks. For example, mechanical ventilation can sometimes cause lung injury if not managed carefully, so we use lung-protective strategies. We also monitor closely for infections or other complications. Parent: How long will my child be in the hospital? Doctor: It varies depending on severity and response to treatment. Some children improve in days, others may need weeks of support. We’ll keep you informed every step of the way. Parent: What can I do to help? Doctor: Being with your child, providing comfort, and communicating with the care team are very important. We also encourage you to ask questions anytime. Parent: What should I watch for after discharge? Doctor: Some children have lingering breathing difficulties or need follow-up for lung function. We’ll arrange appropriate outpatient care and support. REFERENCES Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) ARDS - Diagnosis and treatment - Mayo Clinic https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/803573-medication#2 Esophageal atresia (EA) DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Esophageal atresia (EA) Esophageal atresia is a birth defect (congenital malformation) that affects the way your baby’s esophagus develops. The esophagus is the swallowing tube that connects their mouth to their stomach. “Atresia” means that a passageway in the body is missing or closed. In esophageal atresia, the esophagus is closed at the bottom where it’s supposed to connect to your baby’s stomach. This makes it impossible for your baby to feed normally. Esophageal atresia comes in several different forms, some of which can cause additional complications for your baby. Up to 90% of babies with esophageal atresia also have another birth defect called a tracheoesophageal fistula. This means their esophagus connects to their trachea — their windpipe — instead of their stomach. This can cause them to inhale or choke on what they swallow. Types of esophageal atresia The different types of esophageal atresia (EA), with or without tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), are defined by where the esophagus is closed and where it connects to the trachea, if it does. Type A: While it isn’t the most common, Type A is the most classical version of esophageal atresia. This version doesn’t include a tracheoesophageal fistula. Instead, the esophagus is simply closed at the bottom. It ends some distance above the stomach as a closed pouch. Type B: In Type B, the esophagus is closed at the bottom, and a tracheoesophageal fistula branches off from the upper part of the esophagus, connecting it to the trachea. Type C: This is the most common type of esophageal atresia. In Type C, the esophagus is in two separate pieces. The upper part that connects to the mouth ends in a closed pouch. The lower part connects to the stomach at the bottom and the trachea at the top. Type D: This is the rarest type, and also the most severe. In Type D, the esophagus is in two unconnected segments, and both segments have separate tracheoesophageal fistulas. As congenital malformations go, esophageal atresia is relatively common, occurring in approximately 1 in 3,500 babies. About 85% of these are Type C. Other variations account for about 2% to 7% each. About half of babies with EA have one or more additional birth defects. Only 1% are associated with a genetic syndrome. EA occurs in 25% of babies with Edwards syndrome and 20% with VATER syndrome. Symptoms OF Esophageal atresia (EA) Healthcare providers learn to recognize esophageal atresia by the “three Cs”: Coughing. Choking. Cyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin, a sign of low oxygen). Additional signs and symptoms can include: Foamy mucus in your baby’s mouth. Excess saliva, spitting up or drooling. Gagging when attempting to feed. Respiratory distress. While many different esophageal disorders can cause swallowing difficulties for babies, most don’t cause breathing difficulties the way esophageal atresia can. Both difficulties showing up together usually indicates EA with TEF. CAUSES OF Esophageal atresia (EA) Esophageal atresia is a congenital malformation, which means something forms differently during fetal development, leaving a defect that’s present at birth. In typical fetal development, the esophagus and trachea begin as one tube, which later separates. Esophageal atresia (and often, tracheoesophageal fistula with it) occurs when this tube doesn’t finish developing and separating. This is the main cause. What causes this developmental process to stall is another question. Researchers aren’t sure what the specific causes are, but they suspect genetic and environmental factors are involved. Genetic mutations are changes to your baby’s DNA that affect the way your baby develops. Mutations can be random or partly inherited. Environmental factors, like substances and stress, can make mutations more likely. Risk factors associated with esophageal atresia Researchers haven’t identified the specific environmental factors that may be involved in triggering esophageal atresia. But they’ve observed certain commonalities among babies born with EA. These common factors aren’t direct causes, but they may indirectly raise the risk of EA. They include: Advanced maternal age (over 35) and/or paternal age (over 40). Assisted reproduction technologies, such as IVF (in vitro fertilization) or IUI (intrauterine insemination). Multiple births. EA also commonly occurs with other congenital malformations and genetic syndromes. If a fetus was diagnosed with one of these conditions before birth, there’s a higher chance it may be born with esophageal atresia, as well. Some of the other birth defects and syndromes commonly associated with EA include: Trisomy (13, 18 or 21). VACTERL association. CHARGE syndrome. Congenital heart disease, especially ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot. Other gastrointestinal (GI) atresias, including duodenal atresia, intestinal malrotation and imperforate anus. Kidney and genitourinary defects, such as horseshoe kidney or hypospadias. Spinal malformations, such as tethered spinal cord. Limb malformations. Diagnosis and Tests OF Esophageal atresia (EA) Only a minority of fetuses are diagnosed with EA before birth. Prenatal diagnosis is more likely when the fetus has other abnormalities that are detectable before birth, which may lead to further tests. But early signs of EA can appear on your prenatal ultrasound even if no other conditions are evident. These signs typically appear on your standard 20-week ultrasound, which is also called an anatomy scan. The most common prenatal sign of EA is that there’s more amniotic fluid around the fetus than there should be (polyhydramnios). Since the fetus usually swallows some of this fluid, too much left over suggests the fetus may not be able to swallow it. Your provider might also notice that the fetus’s stomach isn’t filled (small or missing stomach bubble). They might suggest following up with a fetal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). If your healthcare provider suspects EA before your baby is born, they’ll be able to test for it immediately after. If they don’t suspect it before birth, they’ll likely notice the signs soon after. The procedure to check for EA is to attempt to pass a tube from your baby’s mouth or nose through their esophagus to their stomach. If this passageway is closed (atresia), the tube won’t reach their stomach. Your healthcare provider can confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of EA by taking X-rays. This will tell them the nature of the defect and whether your baby has fluid in their lungs or air in their stomach. After diagnosing esophageal atresia, your healthcare provider will check for other congenital malformations that commonly occur with it. Some of these may need treatment first, before your provider can treat EA. Management and Treatment OF Esophageal atresia (EA) Most of the time, surgery can fix the abnormality soon after your baby is born. Some babies may need to stay a little longer in the hospital, receiving nutrition and breathing support, before they’re ready for the operation. They may need more time to grow if they were born prematurely or if their esophagus is too short to repair. Some may need treatment for other life-threatening conditions first, like heart malformations. How can a baby eat with esophageal atresia? Babies with esophageal atresia will need medical assistance to eat until the abnormality can be fixed. Their healthcare providers will schedule surgery to correct it as soon as possible. In the meantime, they’ll receive nutrition through a tube (enteral nutrition) or a vein (parenteral nutrition). This will continue during their surgery and recovery, until they can safely transition to mouth feeding. TREATMENT OF Esophageal atresia (EA) Treatment for esophageal atresia includes stabilizing your baby’s breathing, providing safe nutrition and, ultimately, repairing the malformation through surgery. Some babies may be in the hospital longer than others. Initial management Immediate interventions for EA include: Suctioning of fluids from your baby’s esophagus. Installing a breathing tube to protect their airway. Installing a feeding tube or IV to deliver nutrition and fluids. IV antibiotics to prevent or treat pneumonia. Extended neonatal care Some babies may need to spend more time in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) before they’re ready for esophageal atresia surgery. This includes babies born prematurely, babies with multiple congenital malformations and babies with long-gap esophageal atresia (LGEA). Long-gap EA means that the two segments of the esophagus are too far apart to connect in surgery. They need more time to grow and close the gap. Traction process for LGEA Sometimes, healthcare providers can speed up the growth process for babies with long-gap EA using a type of traction. In this process, a surgeon places stitches on the two ends of your baby’s esophagus and threads them through a small incision in your baby’s back. Here, they can access the stitches and control their tension. Applying gentle traction encourages the esophagus segments to grow together faster. Surgical repair Your baby’s healthcare team will determine when they’re ready for surgery. The goals of esophageal atresia surgery are to: Connect separate segments of the esophagus together (anastomosis). Close off any connections between your baby’s esophagus and airway. Depending on your baby’s condition, they may have one surgery for all of this, or they may have surgery in stages, addressing the fistulas first. Surgery on your baby’s esophagus is called thoracic surgery. Thoracic means in their chest. When possible, surgeons use minimally invasive surgery methods to repair esophageal atresia. This means they access your baby’s chest through small incisions instead of opening it up. A surgeon inserts a small video camera (thoracoscope) through one micro-incision and operates through another, guided by the video. Recovery and follow-up After surgery, your baby will return to the NICU to recover. After several days, they’ll have an imaging test to look inside their esophagus and see how it’s healed. The test is called an esophagram. It’s a type of video X-ray (fluoroscopy) that looks at what happens when fluids pass through their esophagus. When fluids pass through without leaking, your baby will be ready to transition to oral feeding. Your baby will need a little practice to learn to feed by mouth, and their healthcare team will monitor the process closely. They may continue to have some difficulties swallowing. Babies’ esophageal muscles might not work quite as they should. This can be a result of the original congenital malformation, a side effect of surgery or both. Their healthcare team will want to make sure they can get enough nutrition orally. Surgery complications Rarely, the repaired esophagus may continue to leak even after it’s had ample time to heal. This means the anastomosis failed for some reason. An anastomotic leak would require a second surgery to fix it. Another possible complication is that the esophagus develops excessive scar tissue at the site of the anastomosis, which makes it too narrow (esophageal stricture). It might need stretching after surgery. Outlook / Prognosis OF Esophageal atresia (EA) Esophageal atresia alone is rarely fatal. Babies who are born prematurely, or who have other life-threatening conditions — like a heart abnormality — are more at risk. The survival rate for babies who receive treatment and don’t have other compromising conditions is near 100%. The survival rate for babies with either major heart abnormalities or birth weights below 3.5 lbs (1.6 kg) is 80%. For babies with both factors, it’s 50%. While most children recover well and grow to adulthood, some may have lingering side effects from the esophageal atresia and the surgery to fix it. These conditions often improve over time, but they’re likely to require some additional treatment for at least a few years, if not longer. Common long-term side effects include: Tracheomalacia. This means that the cartilage in their trachea (windpipe) is weak, causing the windpipe to partially collapse. It can cause wheezing or noisy breathing, sleep apnea and shortness of breath. Shallow breathing makes children more susceptible to airway infections, like pneumonia and bronchitis. Swallowing difficulties. Your child may continue to have some esophageal dysmotility — difficulties activating or coordinating their esophageal muscles. This can make eating difficult, especially when children transition to solid foods. You may need to pay special attention to what you feed them, make solid pieces smaller and make sure to serve them with ample liquids. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Esophageal dysmotility can also make chronic acid reflux more likely. The lower esophagus muscles may not be able to effectively keep stomach acid from rising into your child’s esophagus. This can cause uncomfortable symptoms, and over time, it can damage their esophagus tissues. Children may also inhale (aspirate) acid particles and damage their trachea. GERD occurs in up to half of children treated for esophageal atresia. Living With Esophageal atresia (EA) Every child is different, and some children have more challenges than others following treatment for esophageal atresia. You can continue to consult their healthcare team for personal advice and support. Some things they might advise include: Delayed weaning. For children with swallowing difficulties, the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) has written specific guidelines for introducing solid foods in stages, beginning at age 3. Consulting a specialist. A speech-language pathologist (SLP) can help train children to use their swallowing muscles more effectively. Vaccination. Since children treated for EA are at a greater risk of chest infections, their healthcare team may recommend vaccines against COVID, flu, pneumonia and RSV. GERD reevaluation. Your child may have a prescription to treat GERD, but medication isn’t always enough. It’s worth checking as they get older to see if GERD is damaging their tissues. If it is, a minor procedure can help stop it. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF Esophageal atresia (EA) Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) (often occurs with EA but can also present alone) Laryngotracheoesophageal clefts — abnormal communication between the larynx, trachea, and esophagus Esophageal webs or rings — thin membranes causing partial esophageal obstruction Esophageal strictures — narrowing due to scarring or inflammation Tubular esophageal duplications — congenital cystic or tubular duplications of the esophagus Pharyngeal pseudodiverticulum — can mimic fistula on imaging, usually post-traumatic Congenital esophageal stenosis — intrinsic narrowing of the esophagus Gastrointestinal atresias or malformations — such as intestinal atresia, duodenal atresia, or imperforate anus (may coexist in syndromes like VACTERL) Neurologic or functional swallowing disorders — causing feeding difficulties without anatomical discontinuity Other congenital syndromes associated with EA — e.g., VACTERL association, Trisomy 13, 18, 21, CHARGE syndrome EPIDEMIOLOGY OF Esophageal atresia (EA) EA is a congenital malformation of the upper gastrointestinal tract with an estimated prevalence worldwide varying from 1 in 2500 to 1 in 4500 births. In the United States, the prevalence is estimated to be 2.3 per 10,000 live births.The relative incidence of EA/TEF increases with maternal age GENOMIC DATA OF Esophageal atresia (EA) Genetic Syndromes and Associations: EA/TEF can occur as part of several genetic syndromes, including: VACTERL association: A multifactorial condition involving vertebral, anal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, and limb anomalies. CHARGE syndrome: Caused by mutations in the CHD7 gene, with about 10% of affected individuals having EA/TEF. Feingold syndrome: Caused by mutations in MYCN, characterized by microcephaly, limb anomalies, and EA/TEF in 30–40% of cases. Opitz G/BBB syndrome: Linked to mutations in MID1 gene on X chromosome. Other syndromes include Pallister-Hall syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and anophthalmia-esophageal-genital syndrome. Key Genes Identified: MYCN (Feingold syndrome) — transcription factor important in development. CHD7 (CHARGE syndrome) — chromatin remodeling gene. MID1 (Opitz syndrome) — involved in microtubule stabilization. Genes in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, including FOXF1, FOXC2, and FOXL1, implicated in VACTERL-like phenotypes with gastrointestinal atresias. Chromosomal Aberrations and Copy Number Variations (CNVs): Several rare CNVs have been identified in patients with EA/TEF, including deletions at 16q24.1 (FOXF1 cluster) and 22q11.2, which overlap with known syndromes and developmental delay loci. De novo CNVs contribute to a minority of cases but are important in genetic diagnosis. Approach Considerations The treatment plan for each baby must be individualized. The prognostic classifications can provide guidance in patients with multiple problems, but early and decisive identification of the most life-threatening anomaly is essential. Management plans for a delayed repair of the esophageal atresia may include placing a 10-French Replogle double-lumen tube through the mouth or nose well into the upper pouch to provide continuous suction of pooled secretions from the proximal portion of the atretic esophagus. The baby may be positioned in the 45° sitting position. Prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, ampicillin and gentamicin) may be used. General supportive care and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) are needed. With careful bedside attendance, these measures may permit a delay of days to perhaps weeks. Some have described cases in which the baby was discharged home with a Replogle tube in situ while waiting for staged repair of an esophageal atresia. However, deaths have been reported in infants in whom the tube did not maintain an empty upper pouch. A gastrostomy, distal tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) ligation, or cervical esophagostomy may permit longer delays in the esophageal atresia repair. However, each intrusion carries a price. If no distal TEF is present, a gastrostomy may be created. In such cases, the stomach is small, and laparotomy is required. In all cases of esophageal atresia in which a gastrostomy is created, care should be taken to place it near the lesser curvature to avoid damaging the greater curvature, which can be used in the formation of an esophageal substitute. When a baby is ventilated with high pressures, the gastrostomy may offer a route of decreased resistance, causing the ventilation gases to flow through the distal fistula and out the gastrostomy site. This condition may complicate the use of ventilation. In cases such as those above or in cases in which a distal fistula continues to cause lung soiling, distal TEF ligation should be considered. This ligation is performed by means of a right-side thoracotomy, ideally via an extrapleural approach. The fistula may be clipped or simply ligated. If it is ligated and divided, subsequent staged repair of the esophageal atresia may be difficult because the distal esophageal segment tends to retract inferiorly to a substantial degree when it is detached from its tracheal mooring. However, simple fistula ligation may allow subsequent reopening of the fistula. Division of the fistula and attempts to anchor it at the midchest with sutures are usually unsuccessful. A cervical esophagostomy or spit fistula may be constructed in the right or left side of the neck, depending on the choice for subsequent esophageal substitution. It allows drainage of the upper pouch and precludes aspiration from the upper pouch. Sham feeding may be commenced in cases in which a long delay to repair is anticipated. This feeding may prevent subsequent oral aversion, which is a real problem in babies who have not been fed by mouth in their early weeks to months of life. However, cervical esophagostomy usually dooms the child to some form of esophageal substitution. In May 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Flourish Pediatric Esophageal Atresia Anastomosis (Cook Medical) for management of esophageal atresia in infants up to 1 year old who do not have teeth and do not have a TEF (or have had a TEF repaired). The device closes the gap in the esophagus by using magnets to pull together the upper and lower portions of the esophagus. It is not indicated for use in patients in whom the distance between the esophageal segments is 4 cm or greater. Future and controversies In the future, more accurate antenatal diagnosis and antenatal treatment may be possible. Minimally invasive techniques for repair with thoracoscopic surgery are now used in some centers, with good results. A better understanding of the pathoembryologic processes of this condition may reveal its causative agents or genetic factors. This knowledge, in turn, may lead to specific antenatal treatments or preventive techniques. In recent years, the incidence of this disorder has decreased, perhaps because of increased usage of antenatal folic acid supplements. Debates continue about the best operative technique (eg, right-side or left-side thoracotomy) for patients with right-side aortic arches, suture type and technique, esophageal lengthening strategies, and procedures for mobilizing the distal esophagus. Other discussions include when to use cervical esophagostomy and the choice of esophageal replacement. The advent of esophageal atresia repairs that combine both minimally invasive and radiologic interventional techniques may be near. GUIDELINES OF Esophageal atresia (EA) The management of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in esophageal atresia is particularly challenging; some advocate aggressive fundoplication, and others prefer more conservative medical treatment. In addition, the true incidence and treatment of tracheomalacia continues to be the subject of debate. Finally, the proper evidence-based guidelines for long-term follow-up remain to be established. Tissue engineering of the esophagus may offer solutions for replacement of lost esophageal tissue. Experimental studies have shown promising results in the culture of esophageal epithelial cells and esophageal smooth-muscle cells. Viability of these cells on biodegradable scaffolds in vitro may provide the necessary replacement esophageal tissue in future. Studies in large animal models have shown promising results in the generation of rudimentary esophageal tissue using tissue engineering and regenerative medicine technology PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Esophageal atresia (EA) Q1. What is esophageal atresia? Answer: Esophageal atresia is a congenital birth defect where the esophagus (the tube connecting the mouth to the stomach) does not form properly and ends in a blind pouch instead of connecting to the stomach. This prevents food and liquids from passing normally to the stomach. Q2. How common is esophageal atresia? Answer: Esophageal atresia occurs in about 1 in 3,500 live births. About 85% of cases are the most common type (Type C), where the upper esophagus ends blindly and the lower esophagus connects abnormally to the trachea (tracheoesophageal fistula). Q3. What causes esophageal atresia? Answer: It occurs during fetal development when the esophagus and trachea fail to separate properly from a single tube. The exact cause is unknown but may involve genetic and environmental factors. It can also be associated with syndromes like VACTERL or Edwards syndrome. Q4. What are the symptoms of esophageal atresia? Answer: Newborns with EA often have difficulty swallowing, excessive drooling, coughing, choking, and may have breathing problems. They may also have frothy bubbles in the mouth and cyanosis (bluish skin) during feeding. Q5. How is esophageal atresia diagnosed? Answer: Diagnosis is suspected if a feeding tube cannot be passed into the stomach after birth. Chest and abdominal X-rays confirm the diagnosis by showing the tube coiled in the upper esophageal pouch and absence of air in the stomach (unless a fistula is present). Q6. What is the treatment for esophageal atresia? Answer: Surgery is required to reconnect the two ends of the esophagus and to close any abnormal connection to the trachea (fistula). Surgery is usually done soon after birth. Feeding is initially done intravenously or via a feeding tube until healing occurs. Q7. What are the possible complications after surgery? Answer: Complications may include leakage at the repair site, esophageal strictures (narrowing), gastroesophageal reflux, and feeding difficulties. Some children may require additional procedures like esophageal dilation or fundoplication to manage reflux. Q8. What is the long-term outlook for children with esophageal atresia? Answer: With appropriate surgical repair and follow-up care, most children grow and develop normally. Some may have ongoing issues with swallowing, reflux, or respiratory infections, requiring multidisciplinary care. Q9. Can esophageal atresia be detected before birth? Answer: Sometimes prenatal ultrasound shows signs such as polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid) or absence of a visible stomach bubble, which may suggest EA. However, definitive diagnosis is usually made after birth. Q10. What support is available for families? Answer: Specialized centers offer multidisciplinary care including surgeons, pulmonologists, nutritionists, and therapists to support children and families throughout treatment and recovery DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Esophageal atresia (EA) Doctor: Hello, I want to talk with you about your baby’s diagnosis. Your child has a condition called esophageal atresia, which means the esophagus—the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach—did not form properly. Instead, it ends in a blind pouch and does not connect to the stomach. Parent: What does that mean for my baby? How serious is it? Doctor: This condition affects feeding and breathing because food and saliva cannot pass normally into the stomach, and sometimes there is an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the windpipe, called a tracheoesophageal fistula. It is serious but treatable, and we have specialized teams experienced in managing this. Parent: How is it treated? Doctor: Your baby will need surgery to connect the two ends of the esophagus and close any abnormal connection to the windpipe. This is usually done within the first day or two of life. In some cases, if the gap between the esophageal ends is large, we may use specialized techniques to gradually lengthen the esophagus or consider other surgical options. Parent: What happens after surgery? Will my baby be able to eat normally? Doctor: After surgery, your baby will be closely monitored in the neonatal intensive care unit. Initially, feeding may be through a tube placed directly into the stomach. Over time, as healing occurs, your baby will start feeding by mouth. Some children may have issues like reflux or narrowing at the repair site, which we manage with medications or additional procedures if needed. Parent: Are there risks or complications? Doctor: Like any surgery, there are risks such as infection, leakage at the repair site, or narrowing of the esophagus. Some babies may also have breathing issues or lung problems, especially if born prematurely. Our multidisciplinary team will monitor and support your baby throughout recovery. Parent: How long will my baby stay in the hospital? Doctor: It depends on how your baby recovers, but typically several weeks. We will keep you informed and involve you in daily care decisions. Many babies go on to live healthy lives with appropriate follow-up. Parent: Can this be detected before birth? Doctor: Sometimes prenatal ultrasounds show signs like excess amniotic fluid or an absent stomach bubble, which can raise suspicion. However, the definitive diagnosis is usually made after birth. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything. What should I do now? Doctor: We will prepare for surgery and ensure your baby is stable. Please feel free to ask any questions at any time. We are here to support you and your family. REFERNCES Esophageal Atresia: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis & Treatment https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/esophageal-atresia https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560848/ https://www.cdc.gov/birth-defects/about/esophageal-atresia.html Tracheoesophageal fistula DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Tracheoesophageal fistula Typically, your esophagus (the hollow tube that connects your throat to your stomach) and trachea (windpipe) are separate. People with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) have an abnormal connection between these two structures. This results in aspiration (inhalation) of food and liquids into your lungs. Tracheoesophageal fistula commonly occurs with esophageal atresia (EA) — a condition that’s characterized by an abnormal connection between your esophagus and stomach. Who does tracheoesophageal fistula affect? Tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital condition. In other words, people are born with it. Most cases of TEF are diagnosed and treated in infancy. It’s also possible for adults to develop tracheoesophageal fistula as the result of esophageal cancer or lung cancer, infections (such as tuberculosis) or trauma from a medical procedure. This is called acquired tracheoesophageal fistula. It’s estimated that tracheoesophageal fistula affects 1 in every 3,000 to 5,000 births in the United States. Approximately 50% of babies with TEF or EA have another congenital condition. Acquired tracheoesophageal fistula, which occurs in adulthood, isn’t common. Very rarely, adults can have congenital tracheoesophageal fistula. This means that they were born with the condition but didn’t develop symptoms until later in life. Types of tracheoesophageal fistula Tracheoesophageal fistula is generally categorized into five different types: Type A: There’s no TEF, only EA. Your esophagus is divided into two parts, with both portions ending in blind pouches (cavities that are closed at one end). This is also commonly referred to as pure esophageal atresia. It makes up about 8% of all cases. Type B: This rare form of TEF affects about 2% of all cases. The lower portion of your esophagus ends in a blind pouch, and the upper portion is connected to your windpipe by a tracheoesophageal fistula. Type C: The most common form of TEF, type C is when the upper portion of your esophagus ends in a blind pouch, and the lower portion is connected to your trachea by a tracheoesophageal fistula. About 85% of babies born with TEF have this type. Type D: In this rarest form of TEF, a tracheoesophageal fistula connects both the upper and lower portions of your esophagus to your trachea. Less than 1% of babies born with TEF have this type. Type E: Your esophagus connects to your stomach normally and is fully intact. However, a tracheoesophageal fistula connects your esophagus and trachea. Type E affects about 4% of TEF cases. Symptoms OF Tracheoesophageal fistula Tracheoesophageal symptoms depend on whether EA is present, as well as TEF. Babies who are born with TEF but not EA usually don’t show symptoms at birth. Over time, however, they may: Have frequent lung infections. Cough when feeding. Babies who have esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula usually exhibit symptoms immediately after delivery. The most common symptoms include: Coughing. Choking when trying to swallow. Breathing problems. CAUSES OF Tracheoesophageal fistula During fetal development, your esophagus and trachea form as one single tube. Typically, about four to eight weeks after conception, a wall develops between these structures, making them two distinct tubes. If this wall doesn’t form properly, it can result in tracheoesophageal fistula. Diagnosis and Tests OF Tracheoesophageal fistula In rare instances, your healthcare provider may suspect a tracheoesophageal fistula before your baby is born due to abnormalities on an ultrasound. Most of the time, however, your medical team may suspect TEF within a few hours of delivery if your baby has excessive mucous, breathing difficulties or is unable to swallow. To confirm a TEF or EA diagnosis, your healthcare provider will likely take X-rays of their chest and abdomen. In addition, they may recommend an endoscopy or bronchoscopy. These tests allow them to look inside of the airways using a thin tube and a lighted camera. If your baby is diagnosed with TEF or EA, your healthcare provider will probably order additional tests to identify or rule out other congenital conditions. Management and Treatment OF Tracheoesophageal fistula Tracheoesophageal fistula treatment involves corrective surgery. During this procedure, the connection between your baby’s esophagus and trachea is repaired. This may be done using traditional or minimally invasive techniques. Are there risks involved with tracheoesophageal fistula repair? As with any surgical procedure, tracheoesophageal fistula repair may be accompanied by complications. Possible risks include anastomotic leaks (when fluid leaks out from the area where the esophagus and trachea were joined), esophageal strictures (abnormal tightening of the esophagus) and damage to the laryngeal nerve. There’s also a chance that TEF could come back later. Approximately 3% to 14% of TEF repairs result in fistula recurrence (return). Recovery from tracheoesophageal fistula treatment Recovery time depends on several factors, including the severity of your baby’s condition and how well they respond to treatment. In most cases, full healing takes up to 12 weeks. Outlook / Prognosis OF Tracheoesophageal fistula If your baby has TEF, your healthcare provider will recommend surgery to address the problem. The extent of surgery depends on the type of TEF. If your baby has postoperative complications, your medical team will keep your baby in the hospital for a few days to monitor their progress. Babies who have complications after their initial surgery are more likely to experience recurrence. Therefore, if your baby has postoperative complications, your healthcare provider will perform periodic follow-ups. Is tracheoesophageal fistula curable? Yes. Tracheoesophageal fistula is curable with surgical intervention. Because it’s a life-threatening condition, it should be treated immediately. Prevention OF Tracheoesophageal fistula Because people are born with congenital TEF, there’s no way to prevent it from happening. And since most cases of acquired TEF are caused by cancer and infections, there’s no known way to reduce your risk for the condition. Living With Tracheoesophageal fistula If your baby has TEF, your healthcare provider will recommend surgery to address the problem. The extent of surgery depends on the type of TEF. If your baby has postoperative complications, your medical team will keep your baby in the hospital for a few days to monitor their progress. Babies who have complications after their initial surgery are more likely to experience recurrence. Therefore, if your baby has postoperative complications, your healthcare provider will perform periodic follow-ups. Diagnostic Considerations OF Tracheoesophageal fistula Consider adult presentation of congenital tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) (ie, recurrent TEF) in adults who present with cough and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. [11] Recurrent TEF in adults may be a late complication of surgical repair performed when they were children. Pharyngeal pseudodiverticulum should be considered in the differential diagnosis of TEFs. This may occur secondary to traumatic perforation of the posterior pharynx from finger insertion into the oropharynx during labor or following vigorous efforts at tube insertion during resuscitation of the newborn. These patients develop pneumomediastinum. A very rare cause of neonatal respiratory distress is tracheal agenesis, which is always fatal within hours of birth. In tracheal agenesis, a nasogastric tube can be inserted easily. Zenker diverticulum is also known as posterior hypopharyngeal pouch and pharyngoesophageal diverticulum. This condition involves herniation of mucosa and submucosa through the oblique and transverse fibers of the cricopharyngeus muscle. The blind pouch develops at the pharyngoesophageal junction at the level of the C5-C6 disc space. The pouch is the result of hyperdynamic cricopharyngeal sphincter contraction associated with an abnormality of cricopharyngeal relaxation. Other considerations The International Network on Oesophageal Atresia (INoEA) consensus statements on the transition of patients with EA-TEF notes that asthma symptoms in adults with EA-TEF can result from aspiration and/or tracheomalacia rather than classic asthma. Vocal cord paralysis is a differential diagnosis in adolescents and adults with EA-TEF who have persistent swallowing dysfunction and chronic respiratory symptoms. Consider laryngoscopy as a key diagnostic modality in these patients. In the setting of persistent respiratory and dysphagia symptoms, particularly if a previous history exists for long-gap EA or congenital cardiac disease, maintain an index of suspicion for a vascular anomaly. If there is a clinical concern for this diagnosis, evaluate further. Differential Diagnoses OF Tracheoesophageal fistula Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Esophageal Cancer Esophageal Diverticula Esophageal Rupture Esophageal Stricture Esophagitis Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Respiratory Failure Tracheal Tumors Tracheomalacia Zenker Diverticulum Epidemiology OF Tracheoesophageal fistula United States data TEFs are a common congenital anomaly with an incidence of 1 case in 2000-4000 live births. Acquired TEFs are quite rare, and incidence rates have not been well documented. Acquired nonmalignant TEFs occur in approximately 0.5% of patients undergoing tracheostomy. The incidence of malignant TEFs was reported at 4.5% for primary malignant esophageal tumors, and 0.3% for primary malignant lung tumors. Other investigators have reported the incidence of TEFs secondary to esophageal carcinoma to be 4.3-8.1%. Race- and age-related demographics No racial predilection is apparent. Congenital TEFs are primarily observed in neonates and during the first year of life. Adults rarely present with congenital TEFs that were undiagnosed during their early years of life. Acquired TEFs may occur in individuals of any age, and elderly individuals are at increased risk if they become ventilator dependent because of respiratory failure. Procedures OF Tracheoesophageal fistula Flexible esophagoscopy or flexible bronchoscopy may be useful in the diagnosis of acquired TEFs. Either or both of these procedures may be required to evaluate the anatomy of these structures and to exclude an unsuspecting mucosal lesion. The role of endoscopic procedures is especially important in localizing the acquired nonmalignant or malignant TEF. Treatment Recommendations: Systematic Evaluation: Children with EA/TEF require ongoing multidisciplinary assessment for GI complications such as gastroesophageal reflux (GER), dysphagia, feeding difficulties, anastomotic strictures, and respiratory symptoms. Regular surveillance including endoscopy, pH monitoring, and imaging is recommended based on symptoms. Acid Suppression Therapy: It is recommended to treat GER with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) starting in the neonatal period to prevent peptic complications and anastomotic strictures. Treatment duration is generally at least 12 months post-surgery, but may be extended depending on persistence of reflux symptoms. Acid suppression should be used cautiously in patients with extra-esophageal reflux manifestations. Management of Anastomotic Strictures: Strictures should be dilated only when associated with significant symptoms such as feeding difficulties or recurrent respiratory infections. Endoscopic evaluation and biopsies are advised to exclude eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) before dilation or surgery. Fundoplication (Anti-Reflux Surgery): Indicated in patients with severe GERD refractory to medical management, recurrent strictures (especially in long-gap EA), cyanotic spells, or long-term feeding tube dependency. Preoperative workup should include barium contrast studies, endoscopy with biopsies, and pH or pH-impedance monitoring. Post-fundoplication dysphagia warrants thorough evaluation including contrast studies and manometry. Investigation of Life-Threatening Events: Multidisciplinary evaluation is essential before surgical intervention in patients with acute life-threatening events (ALTE), cyanotic spells, or brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE). Exclusion of Other Causes: In children with persistent symptoms, other anatomical abnormalities such as vascular rings, recurrent or missed fistulae, congenital esophageal stenosis, and laryngeal clefts must be excluded. Long-Term Follow-Up: Regular follow-up by a multidisciplinary team including pediatric gastroenterologists, surgeons, pulmonologists, and nutritionists is recommended to monitor growth, nutrition, respiratory health, and quality of life. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Tracheoesophageal fistula Q1. What is tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF)? Answer: TEF is a congenital or acquired abnormal connection between the trachea (windpipe) and the esophagus (food pipe). It often occurs with esophageal atresia (EA), where the esophagus ends in a blind pouch. This abnormal connection can cause feeding difficulties and respiratory problems. Q2. How is TEF diagnosed? Answer: Diagnosis is suspected when a newborn has feeding difficulties, choking, coughing, or respiratory distress. Passing a nasogastric tube may be impossible or abnormal. Confirmation is by chest and abdominal X-rays showing the tube coiled in the upper esophagus and air in the stomach if a fistula is present. Contrast studies, endoscopy, and bronchoscopy can further delineate anatomy. Q3. What are the common complications associated with TEF? Answer: Complications include aspiration pneumonia, recurrent respiratory infections, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), anastomotic strictures after repair, esophageal dysmotility, and feeding difficulties. Life-threatening events like cyanotic spells may also occur. Q4. What is the standard treatment for TEF? Answer: Surgical repair is required, typically soon after birth, to close the fistula and restore esophageal continuity. Postoperative care includes management of GERD, nutritional support, and monitoring for complications. Q5. How is gastroesophageal reflux (GER) managed in children with TEF? Answer: Routine use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is recommended for at least 12 months post-surgery to reduce reflux and prevent complications like strictures. Multidisciplinary follow-up is important even if symptoms are absent, as silent reflux and esophagitis are common. Q6. When is anti-reflux surgery (fundoplication) indicated in TEF patients? Answer: Fundoplication is considered for patients with recurrent anastomotic strictures, poorly controlled GERD despite maximal medical therapy, long-term dependence on transpyloric feeding, or cyanotic spells. Before surgery, thorough evaluation including endoscopy, pH monitoring, and imaging is essential. Q7. How are anastomotic strictures diagnosed and treated? Answer: Strictures are diagnosed by symptoms such as feeding difficulties, regurgitation, cough, or recurrent respiratory infections, and confirmed by endoscopy or contrast studies. Dilatation is recommended only for clinically significant strictures causing symptoms. Q8. What other conditions should be excluded in symptomatic TEF patients? Answer: Other causes of symptoms such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), laryngeal clefts, vocal cord paralysis, missed or recurrent fistula, congenital esophageal stenosis, and vascular rings should be ruled out before further interventions. Q9. What is the recommended follow-up for children with repaired TEF? Answer: Regular multidisciplinary follow-up including pediatric gastroenterology, pulmonology, and otolaryngology is recommended. Surveillance endoscopy with biopsies is advised even in asymptomatic patients to detect esophagitis or Barrett’s changes early. Q10. What is the prognosis for children with TEF? Answer: With timely surgical repair and appropriate multidisciplinary care, most children survive and have good long-term outcomes. However, many face chronic issues like reflux, feeding difficulties, and respiratory problems requiring ongoing management. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Tracheoesophageal fistula Doctor: Hello. I want to talk with you about your child’s diagnosis. Your child has a condition called tracheoesophageal fistula, or TEF. This means there is an abnormal connection between the windpipe (trachea) and the food pipe (esophagus). Parent: What does that mean? How does it affect my child? Doctor: Normally, the trachea and esophagus are separate tubes. In TEF, there’s a small passage connecting them, which can cause food or saliva to enter the lungs, leading to coughing, choking, and infections. It also often occurs with esophageal atresia, where the esophagus is not properly connected to the stomach. Parent: How did this happen? Is it something we caused? Doctor: TEF is a congenital condition, meaning it developed before birth. It’s not caused by anything you did. Sometimes it can also be acquired later due to injury or illness, but in your child’s case, it’s congenital. Parent: How do you fix it? Doctor: The main treatment is surgery. The surgeon will separate the trachea and esophagus, close the abnormal connection, and repair the esophagus so your child can swallow safely. The exact approach depends on the type and location of the fistula. Parent: Will my child need surgery right away? Doctor: Usually, surgery is done soon after birth once your child is stable. Sometimes, if the esophageal ends are far apart, we may need to delay or use special techniques to connect them safely. Parent: What happens after surgery? Will my child be able to feed normally? Doctor: After surgery, your child will be monitored closely. Feeding might start through a tube initially, then gradually by mouth as healing occurs. Some children may experience reflux or narrowing at the repair site, which we manage with medications or additional procedures if needed. Parent: Are there risks or complications? Doctor: Like any surgery, there are risks such as infection, leakage at the repair site, or narrowing of the esophagus. We also watch for breathing problems and infections. Our team will support you and your child throughout recovery. Parent: How long will my child stay in the hospital? Doctor: It varies, but typically several weeks. We will keep you informed and involve you in care decisions. Parent: What should I watch for at home? Doctor: Watch for coughing, choking during feeding, difficulty breathing, or fever. If you notice these, contact us immediately. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything. Doctor: You’re welcome. Please feel free to ask any questions anytime.

GENOMIC DATA OF Tracheoesophageal fistula Genetic Syndromes and Associations: TEF is commonly associated with several genetic syndromes, including: VACTERL association (Vertebral anomalies, Anal atresia, Cardiac defects, Tracheoesophageal fistula, Renal anomalies, Limb abnormalities). This is a multifactorial condition with no single genetic cause but often involves microdeletions in the FOXF1 gene cluster (16q24.1). CHARGE syndrome, caused by mutations in the CHD7 gene, with ~10% of affected individuals having TEF. Feingold syndrome (mutations in MYCN). Other syndromes include Pallister-Hall syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 18, 13, and 21. Key Genes and Pathways: The FOXF1 gene cluster at 16q24.1 is implicated in a VACTERL-like phenotype including TEF. Genes involved in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway play a role in foregut development; mutations in these genes have been shown in animal models to cause EA/TEF-like malformations. Mutations in CHD7 (CHARGE syndrome) and MYCN (Feingold syndrome) have confirmed roles in human cases.

Alpha-1 increases your risk of developing certain diseases, including emphysema (damaged air sacs in your lungs), cirrhosis (liver scarring) and panniculitis (an uncommon skin condition). Some of these conditions can be life-threatening. Alpha-1 is sometimes referred to as “genetic COPD” or “genetic emphysema.” Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency affects people who have two copies of the SERPINA1 gene that makes an abnormal type of the Alpha-1 protein. Genes are the instructions for how your body should function. These gene changes can cause your body to have low levels of AAT or no AAT in your lungs, and, depending on the changes, a buildup of AAT in your liver. Any of these changes can cause health issues. People with one abnormal copy of the gene and one normal copy (called Alpha-1 carriers) can also have symptoms and are at an increased risk of lung damage, especially if they smoke. Alpha-1 is one of the most common genetic disorders among those with European ancestry, but it’s uncommon in people of non-European descent. One in 25 people of European descent have at least one abnormal copy of the gene for Alpha-1. In 1 in about 3,500 people in the U.S., both of their genes for AAT are abnormal, putting them at risk for severe organ damage. About 75% of people with two malfunctioning genes will eventually develop lung function issues. How does Alpha-1 deficiency affect my lungs and liver? Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein that forms in your liver and moves through your bloodstream to your lungs. It’s the “off switch” for an enzyme called neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is important for fighting infections in your lungs, but it can also destroy your healthy lung tissue. After elastase has had time to help fight an infection, AAT shuts it off (inhibits) so it won’t damage your lungs. If a gene mutation causes low levels of AAT or creates incorrectly formed AAT, you won’t have enough in your lungs to stop elastase, which will start breaking down the protein elastin in your lungs. Elastin gives strength to the small air sacs of your lungs (alveoli) and allows them to stretch and contract, like a rubber band. Without it, your alveoli lose their shape and become floppy. This makes it so you can’t breathe or get oxygen properly. This is a condition called emphysema. Gene mutations that change the shape of AAT keep it from moving out of your liver. It builds up there and can cause scarring. Since it can’t get out of your liver, it’s not able to move to your bloodstream and your lungs. Alpha-1 isn’t necessarily a terminal illness. Many people with Alpha-1, especially if they don’t smoke, can live a normal life span. Symptoms OF Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Lung diseases caused by Alpha-1 have symptoms similar to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Lung symptoms usually start between the ages of 30 and 50 and include: Shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially with exercise or exertion. A whistling sound when you breathe (wheezing). Chronic cough, often with mucus. Extreme tiredness. Frequent chest colds. About 10% of infants and 15% of adults with Alpha-1 develop liver disease. Signs and symptoms of liver disease may include: Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). Itchy skin. Swelling in your legs or abdomen (ascites). Throwing up blood. Rarely, your first symptoms of Alpha-1 are painful, red bumps on your skin (panniculitis). These can move around on your body and may break open, leaking fluid or pus. CAUSES OF Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Everyone has two sets of genes (the instructions for how your body functions), one from each parent. Just like differences in these instructions can determine what color eyes or hair you have, they can also change how your body functions. Differences (mutations) in a specific gene cause Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The SERPINA1 gene makes a protein called Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) that protects your lungs from damage caused by another protein in your body (neutrophil elastase, which attacks infections in your lungs). There are many SERPINA1 mutations that can change how your body makes AAT. Some tell your body to make less AAT, some tell your body not to make any at all, and some cause AAT to form incorrectly so it can’t get to your lungs. Any of these can cause you to have too little AAT in your lungs to protect them. If both copies of your SERPINA1 gene have mutations, you have Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Depending on the types of abnormal genes, you have a 75% chance of developing lung symptoms. If you have a mutation in just one of your copies of the gene (carrier), your body can usually make enough functioning AAT to protect your lungs. You’re still at an increased risk for lung damage and could eventually develop symptoms, especially if you smoke. Alpha-1 inheritance Carriers of abnormal Alpha-1 genes can pass the mutation on to their children. If both parents are carriers, their children have a 25% chance of having two abnormal genes and a 50% chance of being carriers (one abnormal copy and one normal copy). Since both genes contribute to how you make AAT rather than one being dominant, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is said to have a codominant inheritance. Diagnosis and Tests OF Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency A provider diagnoses Alpha-1 with blood tests. Because it has symptoms of other illnesses, sometimes it can take a long time to diagnose Alpha-1. You might be tested for Alpha-1 if you have liver symptoms or if you’ve received a COPD diagnosis. Tests and procedures your provider might perform include: Blood tests. A provider takes a sample of your blood to measure your levels of AAT and understand how well your liver is working. If you have low levels of AAT, they’ll do genetic testing to identify gene differences associated with Alpha-1. Imaging. X-rays and CT scans can show signs of Alpha-1 in your lungs and rule out other conditions. These tests can show the location of any damage and how severe it is. Pulmonary function tests. These tests can’t diagnose Alpha-1, but they can tell your provider how well your lungs are working. They often involve breathing into a machine that measures your lung function. Liver ultrasound or elastography. If your provider suspects issues with your liver, they may get a liver ultrasound or elastography ultrasound (FibroScan®) to see if there’s any scarring. Liver biopsy. If you have liver damage, your provider may take a small sample of tissue (biopsy) from your liver to determine how severe the damage is. Management and Treatment OF Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency For those with lung conditions from Alpha-1, your provider can treat you with COPD medications and therapies, like bronchodilators and pulmonary rehabilitation. If you have emphysema due to very low levels of Alpha-1 in your blood, they may recommend augmentation therapy. Augmentation therapy delivers normal Alpha-1, collected and purified from blood donors, through an IV. Augmentation therapy can slow the progression of emphysema. If Alpha-1 affects your liver, your provider may be able to treat some of the symptoms, but only a liver transplant can cure Alpha-1 by restoring normal AAT production. Not smoking or drinking reduces your risk of lung and liver damage from Alpha-1. It’s recommended that you get vaccinated to help prevent viral hepatitis and pneumonia. Medications/treatments are used Depending on where Alpha-1 affects you, treatment options may include: Augmentation therapy. Your provider can increase your AAT levels by giving you supplemental normal AAT (collected and purified from blood donors) directly into a vein (IV infusion). This can’t reverse lung damage but can prevent future damage. It doesn’t prevent liver damage from Alpha-1. Medication. Inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators can make it easier to breathe by reducing inflammation and opening your airways. Oxygen therapy. If your oxygen levels are low, your provider may prescribe supplemental oxygen, which a machine delivers through a mask on your face or through small tubes in your nose. Pulmonary rehabilitation. Breathing exercises and physical therapy can make breathing easier. Smoking cessation therapy. If you smoke, your provider can recommend therapies to help you quit. Lung transplant. If your lungs are severely damaged, getting a healthy lung through a transplant can help improve your quality of life. Liver transplant. If your liver is badly scarred, your provider may recommend a liver transplant. A healthy liver should make normal AAT. You should avoid alcohol if you have certain types of Alpha-1 or are a carrier. Alcohol can increase your chances of liver damage. You should also avoid medications that can cause liver damage. A provider can help you identify which medications to avoid. Outlook / Prognosis OF Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Your provider can tell you what to expect in your specific situation. Some people with Alpha-1 never have symptoms or related organ damage, especially if they never smoke. Others can have life-threatening complications. Follow your provider’s recommendations to get the best outcome possible. Complications of Alpha-1 Complications of Alpha-1 can affect your lungs, liver or other organs and include: Progressive lung conditions (like COPD). Permanent damage to your airways (emphysema, bronchiectasis). High blood pressure in the arteries leading from your heart to your lungs (pulmonary hypertension). Liver scarring (cirrhosis). Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Heart, liver or respiratory failure. Inflammation of the fat under your skin (panniculitis). The life expectancy of someone with Alpha-1 varies widely from person to person. Some people live a normal life span and some have life-threatening complications. Your prognosis will depend on: How quickly you’re diagnosed. The type of Alpha-1 you have and how it affects your body. The amount of organ damage you have at diagnosis. How well your lungs are working. How quickly lung or liver disease is getting worse. If you smoke, whether or not you continue to smoke after diagnosis. Smoking reduces your life expectancy with Alpha-1. Prevention OF Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Because it’s inherited (you get it from your parents and are born with it), you can’t prevent Alpha-1. But that doesn’t mean you’ll develop the diseases it can cause. Even with an Alpha-1 diagnosis, there are several things you can do to reduce your risk of organ damage, including: Don’t smoke or vape. Avoid secondhand exposure to tobacco smoke. Avoid lung irritants. Use safety equipment (like face masks) if you work with chemicals or dust. Avoid alcohol use. You should limit or completely avoid alcohol use if you have certain types of Alpha-1 that can cause liver damage. You shouldn’t drink alcohol if you have liver damage. Ask your provider before taking medications or supplements that can affect your liver, like acetaminophen (Tylenol®). Read labels on prescription and over-the-counter medications, vitamins and supplements for warnings about liver damage. Get vaccinated against infectious diseases. This includes respiratory illnesses like the flu, pneumonia and COVID-19 and liver infections like hepatitis A and B. Wash your hands and take other precautions to avoid getting sick with illnesses that can cause lung inflammation. If a family member has Alpha-1, talk to your provider about getting tested. Having a family member with Alpha-1 increases your risk of having it or being a carrier. If you have Alpha-1 or are a carrier and want to have children, you may want to speak with a genetic counselor. They can help you understand the risk of passing genetic changes to your child. Living With Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency The best way to take care of yourself with an Alpha-1 diagnosis is to avoid things that can damage your lungs or liver. This includes smoking, lung irritants, alcohol and certain medications. Follow your provider’s recommendations for other ways to stay healthy and manage your symptoms. When to see a doctor See your provider if you have symptoms of Alpha-1 or if a family member has Alpha-1. Early diagnosis is important, so if you have COPD or asthma, ask your provider if you should get an Alpha-1 test. If you’ve been diagnosed with Alpha-1, see your provider if you have any new symptoms or questions about your care, or if you’re having trouble managing your symptoms. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Q. Based on my child’s symptoms, should I get tested for Alpha-1? A. If your child has unexplained lung problems (such as wheezing, chronic cough, or difficulty breathing), liver issues (like jaundice or elevated liver enzymes), or a family history of Alpha-1 or early lung/liver disease, testing is recommended. A simple blood test measuring alpha-1 antitrypsin levels or genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis. Q2. How can I protect my child’s lungs and liver from damage? A. Avoid exposure to tobacco smoke, air pollution, and respiratory infections as these increase lung damage risk. Ensure your child receives all recommended vaccinations, including flu and pneumococcal vaccines, to prevent lung infections. Maintain a healthy diet and regular check-ups to monitor liver health. Avoid unnecessary medications or substances that can stress the liver. Q3. What foods or medications should I avoid? A. There are no specific foods to avoid, but a balanced, nutritious diet supports liver health. Avoid medications that can harm the liver unless prescribed and monitored by your doctor (e.g., certain antibiotics, acetaminophen in high doses). Always consult your healthcare provider before giving new medications. Q4. Should my family members be tested for Alpha-1? A. Yes. Since Alpha-1 is a genetic condition, family members—especially siblings and parents—should be offered testing to identify if they carry the gene or have the deficiency. Early diagnosis helps with monitoring and prevention of complications. Q5. What other tests might my child need? A. Lung function tests to assess breathing capacity. Liver function tests and imaging (ultrasound) to monitor liver health. In some cases, genetic testing to identify specific mutations. Regular clinical evaluations to track symptoms and organ function. Q6. What’s the prognosis? A. Prognosis varies. Many children with Alpha-1 live normal lives with proper care. Lung disease risk increases with exposure to irritants. Liver disease can range from mild to severe; some children may develop liver fibrosis or cirrhosis over time. Early diagnosis and preventive care improve outcomes significantly. Q7. How do I manage my child’s symptoms at home? A. Follow your doctor’s advice on medications and therapies. Avoid smoke and pollutants. Encourage physical activity appropriate for your child’s ability. Monitor for respiratory symptoms like cough or shortness of breath. Keep vaccinations up to date. Q8. What new or worsening symptoms should I look out for? A. Increased coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing. Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice). Unexplained fatigue, poor appetite, or abdominal swelling. Frequent lung infections or prolonged recovery from colds. Q9. When should I follow up with or contact my doctor? A. Regular follow-ups as recommended (usually every 6–12 months). Contact your doctor if your child develops new respiratory symptoms, jaundice, or signs of infection. If symptoms worsen or you have concerns about medication side effects. Q10. When should I go to the Emergency Room (ER)? A. If your child has severe difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain, high fever, confusion, or bluish lips/face, seek emergency care immediately. Also go to the ER for sudden worsening of liver-related symptoms like severe abdominal pain or swelling. Epidemiology OF Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Frequency United States Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is 1 of the 3 most common lethal genetic diseases among adult white persons, affecting 1 per 3000-5000 individuals. Severe AATD affects an estimated 70,000-100,000 individuals, and approximately 25 million people carry of at least 1 deficient gene. However, less than 10% of severely deficient individuals are currently identified. International AATD has been identified in all populations, but it is most common in individuals of Northern European (1 in 1600) and Iberian descent. Similar rates are found among white persons worldwide, with an estimated 117 million carriers and 3.4 million affected individuals. Race White persons constitute an estimated 117 million carriers and 3.4 million affected individuals. Racial groups other than whites are affected less frequently. Sex Women and men are affected in equal numbers. Age The enzyme deficiency is congenital and has a bimodal distribution with respect to symptoms. It can be seen in neonates as a cause of neonatal jaundice and hepatitis. It can present in infants as cholestatic jaundice and in children as hepatic cirrhosis or liver failure. AATD is also the leading underlying condition requiring liver transplantation in children. In adults, AATD leads to chronic liver disease in the fifth decade of life. As a cause of emphysema, it is seen in nonsmokers most commonly in the fifth decade of life and during the fourth decade of life in smokers. Differential Diagnoses OF Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Autoimmune Hepatitis Bronchiectasis Bronchitis Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Cystic Fibrosis Emphysema Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (Kartagener Syndrome) Viral Hepatitis Staging OF Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency No specific grading system exists for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), but the severity of the emphysema that it creates can be staged using the body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity (BODE) index. This 4-step evaluation of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease appears to identify a population with limited survival who might benefit from intensified therapy. The index has not been evaluated in a population of individuals with AATD. Recommendation Screening and Diagnostic Testing The GOLD guidelines recommend all patients diagnosed with COPD be screened for AATD. Family members should also be screened. The patient and family members should be referred to specialist centers. The Alpha-1 Foundation guidelines recommend the following individuals be tested for AATD : All patients with COPD regardless of age or ethnicity All patients with unexplained chronic liver disease All patients with necrotizing panniculitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or unexplained bronchiectasis Parents, siblings, and children, as well as extended family of individuals identified with an abnormal gene for AAT, should be provided genetic counseling and offered testing for AATD; AAT level testing alone is not recommended because disease risk from AATD is not fully denoted. Testing of symptomatic patients should include SERPINA1 mutations genotyping for at least the S and Z alleles. Advanced or confirmatory testing should include Pi-typing, AAT level testing, and/or expanded genotyping. The initial evaluation of patients diagnosed with AATD should include the following : Complete lung function testing Baseline CT scan of the chest in symptomatic patients or those with abnormal pulmonary function testing results At a minimum, annual follow-up should include a spirometry test and monitoring for liver disease with a focused physical exam for signs of liver disease, liver ultrasound, and laboratory monitoring of AST, ALT, GGT, albumin, bilirubin, INR, and platelets. Repeated chest CT scanning to monitor progression of disease is not recommended. Testing for AATD should be considered in all patients with chronic airflow obstruction, asthma with persistent airflow limitation, emphysema disproportionate to the smoking history or in the presence of liver or skin disease. Initial testing should include spirometry, lung volumes, gas transfer and CT chest scan. Management of pulmonary disease Intravenous augmentation therapy is recommended by the Alpha-1 Foundation guidelines for patients with necrotizing panniculitis or an FEV1 ≤ 65% predicted. Intravenous augmentation therapy is not recommended for the following: Individuals with the MZ genotype Individuals who continue to smoke Individuals with emphysema or bronchiectasis who do not have airflow obstruction. The treatment of liver disease Individuals who have undergone liver transplantation. Additionally, weekly doses higher than the current FDA-approved dose are monitoring of trough AAT blood levels to evaluate the adequacy of AAT augmentation dosing are not recommended. Lung volume reduction surgery is also not recommended for the treatment of AATD. The GOLD guidelines note that ex- or nonsmokers with FEV1 between 35% and 60% are the most likely to benefit from intravenous augmentation therapy. consideration of intravenous augmentation therapy in non‐smoking patients with AATD Genomic Data on Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD): Gene Involved: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, located on chromosome 14q32. This gene encodes the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein, which protects tissues from enzymes like neutrophil elastase. Inheritance Pattern: AATD is inherited in an autosomal codominant manner, meaning both gene copies (alleles) contribute to the trait. Individuals can have different combinations of normal and mutant alleles, influencing disease severity. Common Alleles and Mutations: M allele: The normal allele producing normal levels of AAT. Z allele (p.Glu342Lys): The most common pathogenic variant causing severe deficiency; leads to abnormal protein folding, polymerization, and retention in liver cells, reducing circulating AAT to about 10–15% of normal. Homozygous ZZ individuals are at high risk for lung and liver disease. S allele (p.Glu264Val): Causes moderate deficiency with plasma levels about 50–60% of normal; individuals with SZ genotype have intermediate risk. Over 500 rare SERPINA1 variants have been identified, including null alleles (no protein production) and dysfunctional alleles affecting protein activity or secretion. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Doctor: Hello! I want to talk with you about your child’s diagnosis of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, or Alpha-1 for short. This is a genetic condition that can affect the lungs and liver. Parent: What does this mean for my child? How serious is it? Doctor: Alpha-1 means your child’s body doesn’t make enough of a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, which normally protects the lungs and liver from damage. Some children develop liver problems early on, like jaundice or poor growth, while lung symptoms usually appear later. With careful monitoring and care, many children do well. Parent: How do we protect my child’s lungs and liver? Doctor: It’s very important to avoid exposure to smoke, secondhand smoke, and other lung irritants. Keeping up with vaccinations, especially for flu and pneumonia, helps prevent infections. For the liver, we monitor function regularly and may recommend special diets or vitamins if needed. Your child’s growth and development will be closely followed. Parent: Are there special foods or medicines to avoid? Doctor: There’s no specific food to avoid, but children with liver involvement may need special formulas or extra calories to help with growth. We also avoid medicines that can stress the liver, like ibuprofen or aspirin, unless your doctor says it’s safe. Always check before giving any new medicine. Parent: Should other family members be tested? Doctor: Yes, since Alpha-1 is inherited, testing parents and siblings can help identify who else might have the condition. Early diagnosis helps with monitoring and prevention. Parent: What tests will my child need? Doctor: We’ll do blood tests to check liver function and alpha-1 levels, ultrasound scans of the liver, and lung function tests as your child grows. Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis and helps guide care. Parent: What symptoms should I watch for at home? Doctor: Look for yellowing of the skin or eyes, poor weight gain, tiredness, swelling of the belly, or breathing problems like cough or wheezing. If you notice these, please contact us. Parent: When should we come back for check-ups? Doctor: We usually see children every few months at first, then yearly if stable. But if you notice any new or worsening symptoms, call us sooner. Parent: When should we go to the emergency room? Doctor: If your child has severe difficulty breathing, persistent vomiting of blood, black or bloody stools, or becomes very lethargic or confused, go to the ER immediately. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’re here to support your family and answer any questions anytime.

It is characterized by abnormal development of the blood vessels in the lungs, specifically the small blood vessels surrounding the air sacs called alveoli. This condition hinders the proper exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs, leading to respiratory issues. The exact cause of alveolar capillary dysplasia is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a result of abnormal development during fetal growth. Genetic factors may also play a role in some cases. Understanding this condition is crucial for early detection and management, as it can significantly impact a newborn\\'s breathing and overall health. Symptoms of Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia Alveolar capillary dysplasia is a rare lung condition that can present with symptoms such as difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, and low oxygen levels in newborns. Babies may also have feeding problems, poor weight gain, and blue discoloration of the skin due to inadequate oxygenation. These symptoms typically manifest soon after birth and can be severe, requiring immediate medical attention. If your baby is showing these signs, it is crucial to seek prompt evaluation and care from a healthcare provider familiar with this condition to ensure proper management and treatment. Infants with alveolar capillary dysplasia may experience severe respiratory distress shortly after birth. Difficulty feeding and poor weight gain are common symptoms in infants with alveolar capillary dysplasia. Persistent pulmonary hypertension can occur in individuals with alveolar capillary dysplasia. Failure to thrive, despite appropriate nutritional intake, is often observed in patients with alveolar capillary dysplasia. Recurrent respiratory infections are a hallmark symptom of alveolar capillary dysplasia in affected individuals. Causes of Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia The exact cause of this condition is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve genetic factors. Mutations in certain genes have been associated with alveolar capillary dysplasia, impacting the formation of the tiny blood vessels in the alveoli. These abnormalities can lead to severe respiratory difficulties in affected individuals, often presenting in infancy. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex genetic mechanisms underlying this condition. Genetic mutations affecting the FOXF1 gene Abnormal development of lung blood vessels during fetal growth Environmental factors disrupting normal vascular formation Inherited genetic predisposition from parents Disruption of signaling pathways crucial for lung vascular development Types of Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia Alveolar capillary dysplasia (ACD) encompasses different types that affect the development of the lung\\'s blood vessels. While specific subtypes may not be clearly defined, variations in the severity and presentation of ACD have been observed. These may include forms with distinct genetic underpinnings or variations in clinical manifestations. Researchers continue to investigate the complexities of ACD to improve diagnosis and treatment strategies. Understanding the nuances within the spectrum of ACD is crucial for providing tailored care to individuals affected by this rare lung disorder. Classic type: Characterized by severe alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins. Variants: Includes milder forms such as hypoplasia, absence of pulmonary veins, or a mixed form. Associated conditions: Often linked to congenital heart defects like atrial septal defects or ventricular septal defects. Genetic factors: Some cases are associated with mutations in the FOXF1 gene. Prognosis: Generally poor, with most cases leading to severe respiratory failure in infancy. Treatment: Lung transplantation is the only curative option for severe cases. Risk Factors OF ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA While the exact cause is not fully understood, several risk factors have been identified. These include genetic mutations, particularly in the FOXF1 gene, which plays a crucial role in lung development. Maternal conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and substance abuse during pregnancy have also been linked to an increased risk of alveolar capillary dysplasia. Additionally, certain environmental factors and exposures may contribute to the development of this condition. Early recognition of these risk factors is essential for prompt diagnosis and management of alveolar capillary dysplasia. Genetic mutations, especially in the FOXF1 gene, are a significant risk factor for alveolar capillary dysplasia. Maternal diabetes during pregnancy has been associated with an increased likelihood of a child developing alveolar capillary dysplasia. Exposure to certain environmental toxins or medications while in the womb can raise the risk of alveolar capillary dysplasia. Family history of alveolar capillary dysplasia or other lung disorders can predispose individuals to the condition. Premature birth and low birth weight are risk factors that may contribute to the development of alveolar capillary dysplasia. Diagnosis of Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia Clinicians may first suspect ACD based on symptoms like severe respiratory distress in newborns. Imaging studies can reveal characteristic findings in the lungs that suggest ACD. Genetic testing plays a crucial role in confirming the diagnosis by identifying specific genetic mutations associated with ACD. Additionally, a lung biopsy may be performed to further confirm the presence of abnormal lung architecture typical of ACD. This comprehensive approach helps healthcare providers accurately diagnose ACD and develop appropriate management strategies. Diagnosis of alveolar capillary dysplasia typically involves genetic testing to identify mutations associated with the condition. Imaging studies such as chest X-rays and CT scans can reveal characteristic findings suggestive of alveolar capillary dysplasia. Lung biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis by examining the lung tissue for specific abnormalities. Echocardiography is often done to assess the heart\\'s structure and function, as heart defects are commonly associated with this condition. Treatment for Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia Treatment options for alveolar capillary dysplasia are limited and challenging due to the complex nature of the condition. Currently, there is no definitive cure for this condition, and management focuses on supportive care to address symptoms and complications. This may involve ventilator support, supplemental oxygen therapy, and medications to manage pulmonary hypertension. In some cases, lung transplantation may be considered as a last resort for patients with severe and progressive respiratory failure. Close monitoring and multidisciplinary care are essential in the management of alveolar capillary dysplasia to optimize outcomes and provide the best possible quality of life for affected individuals. Differential diagnosis (DDx) list for Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia (ACD) Idiopathic Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN) Usually reversible with pulmonary vasodilators and respiratory support, unlike ACD which is refractory. Sepsis, Pneumonia, and Other Infectious Etiologies Infectious causes of respiratory failure with systemic signs and treatable with antibiotics. Primary Respiratory Disorders: Surfactant Protein Deficiencies (e.g., surfactant protein B deficiency) Hyaline Membrane Disease (Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome) Pulmonary Hypoplasia (often secondary to congenital diaphragmatic hernia or oligohydramnios) Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) Rare Diffuse Interstitial Lung Disorders (e.g., acinar dysplasia, congenital alveolar dysplasia) Congenital Cardiopulmonary Diseases: Pulmonary venous stenosis Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) Other cardiac defects causing cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension Neurologic Disorders: Perinatal asphyxia Congenital neuromuscular disorders causing respiratory failure without primary lung pathology Pulmonary Arteriopathy Secondary to Chronic Lung or Cardiac Disease Mimics vascular abnormalities seen in ACD but with different clinical course Primary and Secondary Pulmonary Lymphangiectasia Dilated lymphatic vessels causing respiratory distress Epidemiology of Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia (ACD/MPV): Incidence and Prevalence: ACD with misalignment of the pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV) is a very rare, lethal congenital lung disorder. Its exact incidence and prevalence are unknown but estimated to be approximately 1 in 100,000 newborns based on limited data. Fewer than 200 cases have been formally reported worldwide, but many cases likely go undiagnosed or misclassified, especially as idiopathic persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Demographics: More than 90% of affected infants are born at term. There is a slight male predominance (~60%) among reported cases. No specific geographic or ethnic predilection has been identified; cases are reported worldwide. Age of Onset: Clinical symptoms typically present within the first 48 hours of life, with cyanosis and respiratory failure. Atypical or milder forms with delayed onset and longer survival have been described but are rare. Mortality: The condition is almost universally fatal without lung transplantation, with most infants dying within the first few weeks to months of life. Survival beyond the neonatal period is rare and may be related to less severe disruption of capillary development. Associated Anomalies: Many infants with ACD/MPV have additional congenital malformations, especially of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., intestinal malrotation), cardiovascular system, and genitourinary tract. Genomic Data on Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACD/MPV): Key Gene Involved: The primary genetic cause of ACD/MPV is mutations or deletions affecting the FOXF1 gene located on chromosome 16q24.1. FOXF1 encodes a transcription factor critical for pulmonary vascular development. Types of Genetic Alterations: Point mutations (single nucleotide variants) in FOXF1, often de novo (not inherited), are common causes. Genomic deletions involving FOXF1 or its lung-specific enhancer regions upstream of the gene also cause the disease. Mutations can be maternally inherited due to genomic imprinting effects, where the maternal allele is primarily expressed. Some cases involve deletions of the FOXF1 gene cluster including neighboring genes like FENDRR. Molecular Impact: Mutations result in loss of function or haploinsufficiency of FOXF1, disrupting the transcriptional regulation of genes essential for alveolar and vascular development in the lung. This leads to abnormal formation and misalignment of pulmonary veins and deficient alveolar capillary networks. Genomic Imprinting: Studies show parent-of-origin effects, with the maternal allele of FOXF1 being predominantly expressed in lung and intestinal tissues, explaining why mutations on the maternal allele cause disease. Associated Malformations: Besides pulmonary defects, FOXF1 mutations can cause gastrointestinal malformations such as intestinal malrotation and annular pancreas, consistent with its role in mesenchymal development. Recent Research: Novel FOXF1 upstream enhancers have been identified that regulate gene expression in endothelial and mesenchymal lung cells; deletions here also cause ACD/MPV. Mouse models with FOXF1 mutations recapitulate human disease features and show disrupted signaling pathways (e.g., STAT3). PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA Q1. What is Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACD/MPV)? A. ACD/MPV is a rare congenital lung disorder where the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the lungs fail to develop properly and are abnormally positioned. This disrupts oxygen exchange and causes severe pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure shortly after birth. Q2. What causes ACD/MPV? A. The condition is caused by abnormal development of lung blood vessels, often linked to mutations or deletions in the FOXF1 gene on chromosome 16q24.1. Most cases occur sporadically, but some familial cases suggest a genetic basis. Q3. What are the symptoms of ACD/MPV? A. Symptoms typically appear within minutes to hours after birth and include: Severe respiratory distress Cyanosis (bluish skin and lips due to low oxygen) Persistent pulmonary hypertension that does not respond to usual treatments Feeding difficulties and poor growth may also occur Q4. How is ACD/MPV diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is challenging and often requires: Clinical suspicion in newborns with severe hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension unresponsive to therapy Lung biopsy showing characteristic vascular abnormalities Genetic testing for FOXF1 mutations or deletions Imaging and other tests help exclude other causes Q5. Is there a treatment for ACD/MPV? A. There is currently no cure for ACD/MPV. Treatment is supportive and includes respiratory support and management of pulmonary hypertension. Lung transplantation may be considered but is rarely feasible due to rapid disease progression. Q6. What is the prognosis for infants with ACD/MPV? A. The prognosis is poor; most infants do not survive beyond the first few weeks or months of life without lung transplantation. Some rare cases with milder or patchy disease have survived longer. Q7. Are there associated abnormalities with ACD/MPV? A. Yes, many infants have other congenital anomalies, including gastrointestinal malformations (e.g., intestinal malrotation), cardiovascular defects, and genitourinary abnormalities. Q8. Can ACD/MPV be prevented? A. Currently, there is no known way to prevent ACD/MPV due to its genetic and developmental nature. Q9. Is genetic counseling recommended? A. Yes, genetic counseling is advised for families affected by ACD/MPV, especially if a FOXF1 mutation or familial cases are identified. Q10. Where can I find support or more information? A. Support groups such as the Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia Association and resources from rare disease organizations can provide assistance and information. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA Doctor: Hello. I want to discuss your baby’s diagnosis. Your child has a rare lung condition called Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins, or ACD/MPV. Parent: What exactly is that? It sounds serious. Doctor: It is a very rare and serious condition where the small blood vessels in the lungs don’t develop properly. This causes very high blood pressure in the lungs and makes it hard for oxygen to get into the blood. Babies with ACD usually have trouble breathing soon after birth. Parent: How did this happen? Is it something we did? Doctor: This is a congenital condition, meaning it happens during lung development before birth. In most cases, it’s caused by changes in a gene called FOXF1. It’s not caused by anything you did during pregnancy. Parent: How do you diagnose this? Doctor: The diagnosis is often suspected when a newborn has severe breathing problems and high lung blood pressure that doesn’t get better with usual treatments. We can confirm it by looking at lung tissue under a microscope, usually from a biopsy or sometimes after unfortunately the baby passes away. Genetic testing for FOXF1 mutations can also support the diagnosis without invasive procedures. Parent: Is there any treatment? Doctor: Currently, there is no cure. Treatments like oxygen, ventilators, and medications to lower lung pressure can help temporarily, but the condition usually progresses quickly. For some babies with milder forms, these treatments may work longer. The only definitive treatment is a lung transplant, but that’s very complex and not always possible. Parent: What does this mean for my baby’s future? Doctor: The condition is very serious and often fatal in the newborn period. However, there are rare cases where babies survive longer, especially if the disease is less severe. We will support your baby with the best care possible and discuss all options with you. Parent: Are there other problems my baby might have? Doctor: Sometimes babies with ACD also have other congenital problems, like issues with their intestines or heart. We will check carefully for these. Parent: What should I watch for? Doctor: Watch for worsening breathing difficulty, blue or pale skin, or poor feeding. If your baby has trouble breathing or becomes very tired, seek medical help immediately. Parent: Is there any way to prevent this in future pregnancies? Doctor: Since this is usually caused by a new genetic mutation, the risk of recurrence is low, but genetic counseling can help assess your family’s specific risk. Parent: Thank you for explaining. It’s a lot to take in. Doctor: I understand. We are here to support you and your family every step of the way. Please ask any questions anytime.

Asbestos is a mineral that forms tiny and long-lasting fibers when it’s in the air. People in certain industries and occupations like construction, manufacturing, mining, milling, mechanics and electricians (especially those who worked before the 1970s) are most at risk for asbestosis. People who remove asbestos products are also at risk, as are people who served in the Navy on ships where asbestos was in use. When asbestos fibers and dust get into your lungs, they can cause fibrosis (thickening and scarring of your lungs). Asbestos can also cause the membranes surrounding your lungs (pleura) to thicken. This scarring and thickening of your lung tissue can make breathing difficult. In some cases, asbestosis can lead to life-threatening health complications. In severe cases, asbestosis can be fatal. Asbestos exposure can also increase your risk of lung cancer. Asbestos is a group of six natural mineral fibers. These fibers are known for their strength and fire- and chemical-resistant properties. Because of these qualities, the manufacturing and building industries use asbestos to: Strengthen cement and plastics. Provide insulation. Fireproof buildings, textiles and military vehicles. Absorb sound. Asbestos fibers may be white, blue, brown, gray or green. White asbestos fibers (called chrysotile) are the most widely used worldwide. Everyone is exposed to asbestos at some point in their life. Low levels of asbestos are virtually everywhere. Most people don’t get an asbestos-related disease. People who get an asbestos-related disease tend to have had exposure on a regular basis and over a long period of time. The risk of asbestos exposure on the job was highest before the 1970s, though asbestos exposure can still occur today. Because it takes a long time to develop symptoms, providers are still diagnosing many new cases of asbestosis. Regulation of on-the-job exposure to asbestos has reduced the risk of asbestosis, but even with these regulations, workers can be exposed by accident. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), millions of people face exposure to asbestos, mostly in the workplace. It’s hard to estimate how many people are living with asbestosis and other asbestos-related diseases because signs of the disease may not show up for 30 or 40 years. Some studies show that up to 20% of all workers who breathe in asbestos will develop a disease from exposure to asbestos. Not all workers who develop asbestos related disease will have asbestosis. There are other diseases that asbestos can cause, including: Interstitial lung disease (ILD). Pleural effusion. Certain kinds of lung cancer, including pleural mesothelioma. Symptoms and Causes OF Asbestosis Symptoms of asbestosis vary depending on the severity of the disease and may not appear for 20 to 30 years or more after asbestos exposure. The scarring on your lungs from asbestosis typically gets worse slowly. Because of that, you may not notice your symptoms right away. The first symptom of asbestosis is having trouble breathing (being short of breath), especially when you’re working hard or exercising. Other signs and symptoms may include: Chest pain and tightness. Clubbing of your nails. Cough. Crackling sound when inhaling. Fatigue (extreme tiredness) and trouble exercising. Unexplained weight loss. CAUSES OF Asbestosis The main cause of asbestosis is inhaling tiny asbestos fibers or dust. Asbestos fibers are not harmful unless they release into the air. When they are released, the fibers break down into tiny particles. The particles become airborne, and we inhale them. Then they collect in the lungs, causing scarring and inflammation. Scarred lung tissue is stiff and unable to expand, which makes it hard to breathe. The longer you had exposure to asbestos and the more intense the exposure, the higher your chances of developing asbestosis. Building and manufacturing industries used asbestos widely in the past. People who work in these industries and repeatedly inhale asbestos particles are the most at risk for developing asbestosis. Breathing in asbestos particles in the air causes asbestosis. Undisturbed asbestos — such as in insulation or tile — doesn’t increase your risk of the disease. Materials and products that may contain asbestos include: Car clutch pads and brake linings. Construction cement, putties and plaster. Insulation. Pipe wrapping. Siding and roof shingles. Vinyl floor tiles. Casings for electrical wires. Millboard. Patching and joint compound. Floor tile and adhesives. Soundproofing material. Many household products and substances also contain asbestos, including: Artificial ashes and embers used in gas-fired fireplaces. Automobile brake pads and linings, clutch facings and gaskets. Fireproof gloves, stovetop pads, table pads and fire-resistant fabrics (including blankets and curtains). Some plastics, paints, coatings and adhesives. Vermiculite-containing attic insulation and consumer garden products. How long can it take for asbestosis to develop? Healthcare providers sometimes diagnose asbestosis in people who haven’t worked or been around asbestos for decades. It can take up to 30 years to develop symptoms. Risk factors for asbestosis There are regulations in place now that reduce your asbestos exposure while on the job. Still, certain occupations face asbestos exposure, particularly if you demolish or renovate buildings built before the 1970s. Homes built before 1977 may also contain asbestos in materials like pipes, ceilings and floor tiles. Just because you live in a home built before 1977 doesn’t mean you’re at risk. Risk only occurs when asbestos is in an inhalable form like dust. When it’s in a solid state, you’re not at risk. You’re more at risk of getting asbestosis if you have long-term exposure to asbestos. This is true if your job involves handling materials containing asbestos. These types of jobs include: Asbestos miners, installers or removers. Auto and aircraft mechanics. Construction crews. Electrical workers. Railroad and shipyard workers. Studies also show that people who were involved in the rescue and cleanup at the site of the attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York City are at risk for asbestos-related diseases like asbestosis. Factors that affect your risk of developing asbestosis The following factors play a role in your risk: Duration: How long you were exposed to asbestos. In general, the longer your exposure, the higher your risk. Intensity: How much asbestos you were exposed to. Type of industry: Your risk is lower if asbestos is bonded into a product (such as walls or tiles). Your risk is higher if asbestos is released into the air, such as during sawing or demolition. Personal risk factors: Smoking or preexisting lung disease. Genetics: Having a genetic mutation to the BAP1 gene. People with the disease tend to have had exposure for many years through an occupation. You’re not likely to get asbestosis if you disrupt asbestos during a home renovation, for example. Complications that may be associated with asbestosis Many people who have asbestosis have breathing trouble and a cough that doesn’t go away. In more severe cases, complications can be life-threatening. Complications of asbestosis may include: Lung cancer: People who have asbestosis and smoke cigarettes have an even higher risk of lung cancer. Mesothelioma: Cancer that forms in the lining of your abdomen, chest or lungs. Respiratory failure: Your lungs can’t put enough oxygen into your blood, and carbon dioxide builds up in your tissues. Right-sided heart failure: The right side of your heart stops working correctly. Diagnosis and Tests OF Asbestosis Your healthcare provider will examine you and ask about your medical history. Remember to tell them about your exposure to any harmful substances like asbestos. Your healthcare provider may also order tests to complete the diagnosis. These might include: A chest X-ray. A computed tomography (CT) scan. Lung function tests like spirometry. Bronchoscopy. Management and Treatment OF Asbestosis Treating asbestosis aims to manage symptoms and preserve function in your lungs. Treatment can’t reverse lung damage from asbestos. Treatment for asbestos-related diseases aims to relieve symptoms, treat complications related to the disease and slow its progress. Your treatment depends on the severity of the disease. Your options might include: Oxygen therapy: Receiving extra oxygen through a mask or tube in your nostrils helps you breathe more comfortably. Pulmonary rehabilitation: Exercises and behavioral changes can improve your quality of life. Lung transplant surgery: In rare cases, a new, healthy lung from a lung transplant can relieve symptoms and prolong life. Medication: Medicines called “anti-fibrotics” can slow down the rate at which scarring gets worse but can’t heal existing scarring. Your provider can discuss the risks and benefits of these medicines and help you decide what’s best for your health. What can I do at home to manage the symptoms of asbestosis? To make things easier on yourself if you have asbestosis, you can follow a healthy lifestyle by: Not smoking. If you do smoke, get help quitting. Smoking speeds up the progression of the disease and makes it worse. Avoiding breathing air that\\'s contaminated with allergens, particles, chemicals or secondhand smoke. Avoiding sick people and practicing good handwashing hygiene. Drinking lots of water. Eating nutritious foods. Exercising regularly after discussing an exercise plan or routine with your healthcare provider. Outlook / Prognosis OF Asbestosis There isn’t a cure for asbestosis, and you can’t reverse the damage from the disease. Once you breathe in asbestos fibers, they stay in your body. Your prognosis varies depending on how long and how much exposure you had to the particles. Many people with mild asbestosis live fulfilling lives for many years after being diagnosed. Others get worse and need medical treatment for the rest of their lives. Your healthcare provider is likely to order chest X-rays and lung function tests every few years to look for changes in the scarring in your lungs. The findings on your imaging tests will change as the stages of your condition progress. The average life expectancy is about 10 years once you receive a diagnosis. It depends on how severe the disease is and how fast it progresses. Prevention OF Asbestosis You can reduce your risk of asbestosis by avoiding long-term exposure to asbestos. If your job involves exposure to the mineral, you should wear a respirator (a mask that filters particles from the air). This protective mask keeps you from inhaling asbestos fibers or dust. If you know you’ve had asbestos exposure, you should have regular exams and chest X-rays. These tests don’t prevent asbestosis but can help catch it early. If you smoke and have exposure to asbestos, quitting smoking is your best way to reduce your risk of getting cancer. Should I avoid all asbestos products? Asbestos fibers are only harmful when they get in the air. Today, building materials and many other products use bonded asbestos. This process keeps them from being released into the air. There’s little to no risk of harmful health effects from these products. However, take care not to sand, tear or otherwise damage or crumble the material. This can release the fibers into the air. Do I need to remove asbestos materials from my home? If you have asbestos materials in your home that are in good condition, it’s best to leave them alone. If you touch or disturb the material, you risk releasing the fibers into the air. Have these materials inspected from time to time for signs of damage or deterioration. When to see a doctor Contact your healthcare provider if you’ve had exposure to asbestos and have trouble breathing, chest discomfort or a cough that doesn’t go away. Be sure to tell your provider about your asbestos exposure, even if it’s secondhand. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Asbestosis Q. If I was exposed to asbestos through my job, does that increase health risks for my family members? A. It’s possible to have “secondhand” asbestos exposure. When a person works with asbestos materials, they can bring home particles on their shoes, clothing, skin and hair. To decrease this risk, most jobs that use asbestos materials make sure that the workers change when they arrive and leave work. Most companies also have showers available for employees to clean particles from hair and skin. These precautions lower the risk of family members developing any diseases. Q. What is the difference between asbestosis and mesothelioma? A. The main difference between asbestosis and mesothelioma is that mesothelioma is cancer and asbestosis isn’t cancer. The disease of asbestosis remains in your lungs and pleura (the covering of your lungs). Mesothelioma begins in the tissue of your lungs and abdomen. It can spread throughout your body. Diagnostic Considerations ON Asbestosis Determining the cause of asbestosis depends on the clinician\\'s assessment of the levels and duration of exposure and on knowledge of occupational epidemiologic studies. Assessment of impairment, which is a key ingredient in determining disability, is based mainly on pulmonary function studies. No evidence exists to confirm that small-airway disease, which is detected by flow volume curves, progresses to asbestosis. Clinicians should be aware of the variety of diseases that may coexist with asbestosis. Additionally, clinicians should keep in mind that the risk for bronchogenic carcinoma is increased with asbestos exposure and load, even without asbestosis. Conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis of asbestosis include collagen-vascular diseases and other interstitial pulmonary disorders. Differential Diagnoses OF Asbestosis Coal Workers\\' Pneumoconiosis (Black Lung Disease) Dermatomyositis Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) Sarcoidosis Silicosis Epidemiology OF Asbestosis In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 125 million people worldwide are exposed to asbestos in the workplace, that more than 100,000 people die each year from asbestos-related lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis, and that nearly 400 deaths are attributable to nonoccupational exposure to asbestos. According to mortality data from the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), 6290 deaths were attributed to asbestosis in the period 1999-2010, of which the majority (95%) were in White males (median age, 79 y). A 2024 study using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study reported that during the period 1990-2019, the overall number of deaths due to occupational exposure to asbestos increased by 20.2% in the United States, but the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and the age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate (ASDR) declined. A 2024 study reported that in 2019, occupational asbestos exposure was responsible for 239,330 deaths and 4,189,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally.Over the period 1990-2019, deaths attributed to occupational asbestos exposure increased by 65.65% globally, and DALYs increased by 43.66%. According to World Trade Center Health Registry estimates, about 410,000 people were exposed to asbestos when as much as 400 tons of it was released following the collapse of the the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. Those at highest risk for developing 9/11-related illnesses were workers who participated in the rescue, recovery, and cleanup efforts at the sites of the towers, along with those living and working in lower Manhattan during the cleanup. A substantial amount of asbestos remains in buildings and eventually will be removed, either during remediation or renovations or demolition. It has been estimated that approximately 1.3 million workers in construction and general industry may be exposed to asbestos during maintenance activities or remediation of buildings containing asbestos. In the United States, vermiculite mined in Libby, Montana, was found to be contaminated with asbestos; this vermiculite was used in 70% of vermiculite insulation in the United States between 1919 and 1990. In a study of 128 Libby miners, 119 had asbestos-related findings on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Asbestos has not been mined in the United States since 2002, but in 2016, approximately 340 metric tons of asbestos was imported for use in the chloralkali industry to manufacture semipermeable diaphragms in electrolytic cells; in addition, an unknown quantity of asbestos was imported within manufactured products, possibly including brake linings and pads, building materials, gaskets, millboards, and yarn and thread, among others. In 2024, however, no asbestos was imported. Globally, bans on asbestos use are in place in several countries, including Australia, Japan, South Africa, and the nations of the European Union; asbestos use is restricted in the United States and Canada. However, persons who have been previously exposed to asbestos continue to be at risk for asbestosis and other asbestos-related diseases as a consequence of the long latency periods following exposure. In addition, trends in developing countries and countries that are emerging as economic powers indicate an increasing problem with asbestos-related diseases Procedures OF Asbestosis Bronchoalveolar lavage BAL has only limited application in the diagnosis and management of asbestosis. It is helpful in diagnosing infections that may present with diffuse infiltrates and simulate asbestosis, and it may aid in the diagnosis of a coexisting bronchogenic carcinoma. In workers who are exposed to asbestos, BAL can provide quantitative information through asbestos fiber counts. The presence of more than one asbestos body (i.e., coated asbestos fiber) per 1 mL of lavage effluent suggests significant exposure. Bronchoscopy Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is performed to facilitate BAL. In addition, bronchoscopy is indicated for airway examination when findings from radiologic studies are suggestive of bronchogenic carcinoma. Transbronchoscopic lung biopsy is not recommended for diagnosis of asbestosis. This procedure yields inadequate tissue and may cause crush alterations to the tissue. Open lung biopsy Open lung biopsy is not indicated in most cases of asbestosis. However, this procedure provides sufficient tissue for the pathologist to make a definitive diagnosis. Asbestosis Treatment, Drug Information, and Their Side Effects 1. Medications Corticosteroids (e.g., Prednisolone) Purpose: Reduce lung inflammation and suppress the immune response. Typical Use: May be prescribed during acute exacerbations or to reduce chronic inflammation. Dosage: Often starts at 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day orally, tapered over weeks to months based on response. Side Effects: Weight gain Increased blood sugar (risk of diabetes) Osteoporosis Increased infection risk Mood changes Hypertension Cataracts and glaucoma (long-term use) Immunosuppressive Agents (e.g., Azathioprine) Purpose: Sometimes used with corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Side Effects: Bone marrow suppression (leading to anemia, infection risk) Liver toxicity Nausea and vomiting Increased risk of infections Other Agents Colchicine: Mild antifibrotic effects; limited evidence. Bronchodilators/Inhalers: For patients with coexisting COPD or airway obstruction (e.g., long-acting beta-agonists, inhaled corticosteroids). Antibiotics: Prompt treatment of respiratory infections. 2. Oxygen Therapy Purpose: For patients with low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) at rest or exertion. Benefits: Improves oxygenation, reduces breathlessness, and may improve survival. Side Effects: Generally safe; prolonged high-flow oxygen may cause dryness or nasal irritation. 3. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Structured programs including exercise training, breathing techniques, nutritional counseling, and education. Improves lung function, exercise tolerance, and quality of life. 4. Surgical Options Lung Transplantation: Considered in severe, end-stage disease when other treatments fail. Pleural Procedures: Decortication or pleurectomy may relieve symptoms related to pleural fibrosis or effusions but are not curative. 5. Lifestyle and Supportive Care Smoking Cessation: Critical to slow disease progression. Vaccinations: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines to prevent infections. Diet: Balanced nutrition supports overall health. Avoidance: Minimize exposure to lung irritants and infections. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Asbestosis Doctor: Hello, I want to discuss your diagnosis of asbestosis, which is a lung condition caused by exposure to asbestos fibers. Patient: What exactly is asbestosis? How serious is it? Doctor: Asbestosis is a chronic lung disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibers, which leads to scarring of the lung tissue. This scarring makes it harder for your lungs to expand and for oxygen to pass into your bloodstream. It can cause symptoms like shortness of breath and a persistent cough. The disease can progress over time, so it’s important we manage it carefully. Patient: How did I get this? Is it from my job? Doctor: Yes, asbestos exposure most commonly happens in workplaces where asbestos was used, such as construction, shipbuilding, or manufacturing. Sometimes exposure can also occur in older buildings during renovations. It’s important to avoid any further exposure. Patient: What can be done to treat it? Doctor: While there’s no cure to reverse the lung scarring, we focus on managing symptoms and slowing progression. This includes quitting smoking if you smoke, avoiding further asbestos exposure, getting vaccinated against flu and pneumonia, and using oxygen therapy if needed. Pulmonary rehabilitation can help improve your breathing and quality of life. Patient: Are there medicines I can take? Doctor: Sometimes corticosteroids or other medications are used to reduce inflammation, but their benefit in asbestosis is limited. We mainly treat complications like infections promptly. Your care will be tailored based on your symptoms and lung function. Patient: What should I watch out for? Doctor: Watch for worsening shortness of breath, increased coughing, chest pain, or signs of infection like fever. If you notice these, please contact us promptly. Patient: Will I need regular check-ups? Doctor: Yes, regular monitoring is important to track your lung function and overall health. We’ll schedule periodic visits and tests to manage your condition proactively. Patient: Is there anything I can do to protect others around me? Doctor: Yes, it’s important to avoid bringing asbestos fibers home on your clothes or belongings. Follow workplace safety guidelines strictly and inform family members if they might be at risk. Patient: Thank you for explaining. It’s reassuring to know what to expect. Doctor: You’re welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re here to support you.

An atrial septal defect (ASD) is an abnormal hole in this wall. ASD is a heart problem that is present at birth (congenital). ASDs can happen on their own. Or they can happen in children born with other congenital heart defects. Girls have ASDs twice as often as boys. Doctors don\\'t know why this is. ASDs are classified by their different location and development: Secundum ASD occurs in the middle part of the atrial septum. Primum ASD occurs in the lower part of the atrial septum close to the tricuspid and mitral valves. Sinus venosis occurs in the upper part of the atrial septum near the veins that drain into the right and left atrium. Coronary sinus ASD occurs when there is a defect in the wall between the coronary sinus and the left atrium. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is an opening between the right and left atria that is normally present. It typically closes shortly after birth. But a PFO is not considered an ASD because no septal tissue is missing. causes of atrial septal defect in a child The heart forms during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy. It starts as a hollow tube and divides into 4 chambers. These chambers are separated by walls (septa). It\\'s normal for the walls to have openings as the fetus grows. The openings usually close shortly before or just after birth. If they don\\'t all close, the atrial septum will have a hole in it. This is called an ASD. Some congenital heart defects may be passed down in certain families. Most atrial septal defects occur by chance. Doctors can\\'t find a clear reason why they happen. symptoms of an atrial septal defect in a child Many children have no symptoms and seem healthy. If the ASD is large, your child may have symptoms. Your child may: Tire easily Have fast breathing Have shortness of breath Grow slowly Have respiratory infections often Have abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmias) Older children and adults with ASDs may have migraine headaches. But it\\'s not clear if the ASD is the cause. A small blood clot that forms in the bloodstream that may cause a stroke can be linked to ASD in older children and adults. But it does not appear that closing the defect or taking blood thinners (anticoagulants) decreases risk. The symptoms of ASD can seem like other health conditions. Have your child see his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Diagnosis OF Atrial septal defect in children Your child\\'s healthcare provider may have heard a heart murmur when listening to your child\\'s heart with a stethoscope. The heart murmur is from the abnormal flow of blood through the heart. Your child may need to see a pediatric cardiologist for a diagnosis. This is a doctor with special training in treating heart problems in children. The doctor will examine your child and listen to your child\\'s heart and lungs. The doctor will find out where the murmur is best heard and how loud it is. Your child may have some tests, such as: Chest X-ray. This test may show an enlarged heart. Or it may show changes in your child\\'s lungs because of the blood flow changes caused by an ASD. Electrocardiogram (ECG). This test records the electrical activity of the heart. It shows abnormal rhythms (arrhythmias) that may be caused by an ASD. It can also find heart muscle stress caused by an ASD. Echocardiogram (echo). This test uses sound waves to make a moving picture of the heart and heart valves. An echo can show the blood flow through the atrial septal opening and find out how big the opening is. Cardiac catheterization. This test uses a thin, flexible tube (catheter) put near the heart. Contrast dye is used to get even clearer pictures. In some children, this procedure may be used to close the ASD. TREATMENT OF Atrial septal defect in children Treatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is. The most common type of ASD may close on its own as your child grows. Once an ASD is diagnosed, your child\\'s cardiologist will check your child to see if the defect is closing on its own. An ASD will usually be fixed if it has not closed by the time a child starts school. The decision to close the ASD may also depend on the size of the defect or the symptoms of the defect. Treatment may include: Medicine. Many children have no symptoms and don\\'t need medicine. But medicine can help some children\\'s hearts work better. For example, water pills (diuretics) help the kidneys get rid of extra fluid from the body. Surgery. Your child\\'s ASD may be repaired by surgery. The surgery is done under general anesthesia. The defect may be closed with stitches or a special patch. Device closure. Some children are helped with this procedure. The doctor uses cardiac catheterization to put a special device (septal occluder) in the open ASD. The device stops blood from flowing through the ASD. possible complications OF Atrial septal defect in children Large ASDs may cause lung problems over time if not treated. This is because the extra blood passing through the defect and then into the lungs may harm the vessels in the lungs. How can I help my child live with an atrial septal defect? All children with an ASD need to be cared for by a pediatric cardiologist. Most children who have had an ASD repair will live healthy lives. After the repair, your child\\'s doctor may want your child to take antibiotics. This will prevent an infection of the heart lining (bacterial endocarditis). With early diagnosis and repair of an ASD, children usually do very well. They don\\'t need much follow-up care. Children are more likely to have problems if an ASD is diagnosed later in life and never repaired. Or they may have problems if complications occur after closing the defect. Some children develop high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). These children should have follow-up care at a center that specializes in congenital heart disease. Talk with your child\\'s healthcare provider about the outlook for your child. When to see a doctor Call your child\\'s healthcare provider if your child has new symptoms or symptoms that get worse. Symptoms may include: Tiredness that gets worse Troubled breathing Fast breathing Racing or fluttering heartbeat (palpitations) Poor feeding DIFFERENTAIL DIAGNOSIS OF Atrial septal defect in children Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD) Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) Innocent (Physiologic) Murmur Pulmonary (Pulmonic) Stenosis Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR) Coronary Sinus Defect (Unroofed Coronary Sinus) Ostium Primum ASD (a type of partial AVSD) Sinus Venosus ASD (superior and inferior types) Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) Pediatric Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) Epidemiology: Incidence and Prevalence: ASD occurs in approximately 1.6 to 3.9 per 1000 live births in children. It accounts for about 5-10% of all congenital heart defects (CHD) and is the third most common CHD after ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus. Types of ASD: The most common type is ostium secundum ASD, comprising around 80% of cases. Other types like ostium primum, sinus venosus, and coronary sinus defects are less common in children. Age at Diagnosis: Many ASDs are diagnosed in infancy or early childhood. For example, in a study from Ethiopia, 50% of children were diagnosed within the first year of life, and 29% during early childhood (1–5 years). However, some children remain asymptomatic and are diagnosed later. Sex Distribution: ASD is more common in females, with female-to-male ratios reported between 1.3:1 to 2:1. Risk Factors: Preterm birth is associated with a higher incidence of ASD, with preterm infants having 3 to 4 times increased risk compared to term infants. Other risk factors include genetic predisposition and associated congenital anomalies. Natural History and Outcomes: Many small ASDs close spontaneously in early childhood, while larger defects may require intervention. Untreated ASDs can lead to complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure in adulthood Genomic Data on Pediatric Atrial Septal Defect (ASD): Genetic Heterogeneity: ASD is a genetically heterogeneous congenital heart defect. Multiple genes and mutations contribute to its development, often involving cardiac transcription factors and structural proteins essential for heart septation. Key Genes Implicated: Genetic Syndromes Associated with ASD: Holt-Oram Syndrome: TBX5 mutations; autosomal dominant; limb and cardiac defects. Ellis-van Creveld Syndrome: Autosomal recessive; skeletal dysplasia and common atrium. Other syndromes with chromosomal abnormalities may include ASD. Molecular Pathogenesis: Mutations in these genes disrupt transcriptional regulation, cardiomyocyte proliferation, and sarcomeric protein interactions during atrial septum formation, leading to septal defects. Inheritance Patterns: Many ASD cases are sporadic, but familial cases show autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Atrial septal defect in children Q1. What is an atrial septal defect (ASD)? A. An ASD is a hole in the wall (septum) between the two upper chambers of the heart (atria). This allows blood to flow between the left and right atria, which can affect normal blood circulation. Q2. What causes ASD in children? A. ASDs occur due to abnormal development of the atrial septum during fetal life. The exact cause is often unknown, but some cases are linked to genetic factors or syndromes. It is a congenital heart defect present at birth. Q3. What are the types of ASD? A. The main types are: Ostium secundum ASD (most common) Ostium primum ASD Sinus venosus ASD Coronary sinus ASD Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is not considered a true ASD but a flap-like opening that normally closes after birth. Q4. What symptoms do children with ASD have? A. Many children with small ASDs have no symptoms and grow normally. Larger ASDs may cause: Tiring easily or fatigue Shortness of breath, especially during activity Poor growth or feeding difficulties Frequent respiratory infections Heart palpitations or arrhythmias (less common in young children) Q5. How is ASD diagnosed? A. A heart murmur is often the first sign detected by a doctor. Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) confirms the diagnosis and shows the size and location of the defect. Other tests may include ECG, chest X-ray, or cardiac MRI if needed. Q6. Can ASD close on its own? A. Yes, small ASDs, especially ostium secundum types, may close spontaneously during infancy or early childhood. Larger defects usually require monitoring and sometimes intervention. Q7. How is ASD treated? A. Small, asymptomatic ASDs may just need regular follow-up. Larger or symptomatic ASDs often require closure, either by catheter-based device or surgery, to prevent complications. Treatment decisions depend on the size of the defect, symptoms, and impact on heart function. Q8. What complications can occur if ASD is untreated? A. Untreated large ASDs can lead to: Enlargement and strain of the right side of the heart Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) Increased risk of stroke in adulthood Heart failure in severe cases Q9. What is the prognosis for children with ASD? A. With appropriate diagnosis and treatment, most children with ASD do very well and lead normal lives. Early intervention prevents long-term complications. Q10. When should I seek medical attention for my child? A. Seek prompt care if your child has: Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing Poor feeding or failure to thrive Excessive tiredness or fatigue Signs of heart failure like swelling of legs or abdomen Palpitations or fainting episodes DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Atrial septal defect in children Doctor: Hello! I want to talk with you about your child’s heart condition called an atrial septal defect, or ASD. It’s sometimes called a “hole in the heart.” Parent: What exactly is an ASD? Doctor: An ASD is a small opening in the wall between the two upper chambers of the heart, called the atria. This hole lets some oxygen-rich blood from the left side mix with oxygen-poor blood on the right side, which means more blood than usual goes to the lungs. Parent: How did this happen? Is it something we caused? Doctor: No, ASDs happen during your child’s heart development before birth. Sometimes it can run in families, but often we don’t know the exact cause. It’s not due to anything you did during pregnancy. Parent: What symptoms should we look for? Doctor: Many children with ASD have no symptoms and grow normally. Larger defects can sometimes cause tiredness, poor growth, shortness of breath, or frequent lung infections. But most kids do very well. Parent: How do you diagnose it? Doctor: We usually hear a heart murmur during a checkup, which prompts us to do an echocardiogram — an ultrasound of the heart — to see the size and location of the hole. Parent: Will the hole close on its own? Doctor: Small ASDs often close by themselves during infancy or early childhood. If it doesn’t close or is large, we usually recommend closing it with a minimally invasive procedure or surgery, often before the child starts school. Parent: What does the treatment involve? Doctor: Many ASDs can be closed using a catheter-based procedure, where a device is placed through a vein in the leg to seal the hole. It usually requires just an overnight hospital stay and has a quick recovery. If that’s not possible, surgery is very effective too. Parent: What happens if we don’t treat it? Doctor: Untreated large ASDs can cause heart strain, irregular heartbeats, lung high blood pressure, and increased risk of stroke later in life. That’s why we recommend repair when needed. Parent: Can my child live a normal life? Doctor: Yes, with proper treatment and follow-up, most children with ASD live healthy, active lives without restrictions. Parent: Is there anything special we should do at home? Doctor: No special restrictions are usually needed. Just keep regular checkups and watch for any breathing problems or unusual tiredness. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything. Doctor: You’re welcome! We’re here to support you and your child every step of the way. Feel free to ask any questions anytime.

This condition is also called atrioventricular canal (AV canal) defect or endocardial cushion defect. In people with AVSD, the valves that control blood flow between these chambers may not form correctly. In AVSD, blood flows where it normally should not go. The blood may also have a lower-than-normal amount of oxygen, and extra blood can flow to the lungs. This extra blood being pumped into the lungs forces the heart and lungs to work harder than usual. This may lead to heart failure. Occurrence About 1 in 1,712 (about 2,154) babies in the United States are born with an AVSD each year. Types There are two general types of AVSD that can occur. The types depend on which structures are not formed correctly. Complete AVSD A complete AVSD occurs when there is a large hole in the center of the heart. This allows blood to flow between all four chambers of the heart. This hole occurs where the septa (walls) separating the two top chambers (atria) and two bottom chambers (ventricles) normally meet. There is also one common valve in the center of the heart instead of two separate valves. This common valve often has leaflets (flaps) that may not be formed correctly or do not close tightly. A complete AVSD arises during pregnancy when: The common valve fails to separate into the two distinct valves, the tricuspid valve on the right side of the heart and the mitral valve on the left side, and The walls that split the upper and lower chambers of the heart do not grow all they way to meet in the center of the heart. Partial or incomplete AVSD A partial or incomplete AVSD occurs when the heart has some, but not all of the defects of a complete AVSD. There is usually a hole in the atrial wall or in the ventricular wall near the center of the heart. A partial AVSD usually has both mitral and tricuspid valves, but one of the valves (usually mitral) may not close completely. This allows blood to leak backward from the left ventricle into the left atrium. Signs and symptoms OF ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTIAL DEFECTS Babies with a complete AVSD usually have symptoms within the first few weeks after birth. When symptoms occur, they may include: Breathing problems Weak pulse Ashen or bluish skin color Poor feeding, slow weight gain Tiring easily Swelling of the legs or belly Certain symptoms may indicate that a baby\\'s complete AVSD or partial AVSD is getting worse. These symptoms include: Arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm). An arrhythmia can cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly. When the heart does not beat properly, it can\\'t pump blood effectively. Heart failure. When the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to meet the needs of the body. Pulmonary hypertension, a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart. For partial AVSDs, the holes between the chambers of the heart may not be large. Therefore, signs and symptoms may not occur in the newborn or infancy periods. In these cases, people with a partial AVSD might not be diagnosed for years. Complications OF ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTIAL DEFECTS Infants who have surgical repairs for AVSD are not cured and may have lifelong complications. The most common complication is a leaky mitral valve. This is when the mitral valve does not close fully, allowing blood to flow backwards through the valve. A leaky mitral valve can cause the heart to work harder to get enough blood to the rest of the body. A leaky mitral valve might have to be surgically repaired. Risk factors OF ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTIAL DEFECTS The causes of AVSDs among most babies are unknown. Some babies have heart defects because of changes in their genes or chromosomes. A combination of genes and other risk factors may increase the risk for AVSD. These factors can include things in a mother\\'s environment, what she eats or drinks, or the medications she uses during pregnancy. Diagnosis OF ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTIAL DEFECTS AVSD may be diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after the baby is born. During pregnancy During pregnancy, screening tests (prenatal tests) check for birth defects and other conditions. An ultrasound, a tool that creates pictures of the baby, may detect an AVSD. However, it usually depends on the size or type (partial or complete) of the AVSD. The healthcare provider can request a fetal echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis if AVSD is suspected. A fetal echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the unborn baby\\'s heart and shows more detail than the routine prenatal ultrasound test. The fetal echocardiogram can show problems with the structure of the heart and how well the heart is working. After the baby is born During a physical exam of an infant, a complete AVSD may be suspected. Using a stethoscope, a doctor may hear a heart murmur (a \"whooshing\" sound caused by irregular blood flow through the heart). However, not all heart murmurs are present at birth. A healthcare provider may request additional tests to confirm the diagnosis of AVSD. These tests include: Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) Electrocardiogram (EKG) (measures electrical activity of the heart) Chest X-ray Other medical tests Treatments OF ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTIAL DEFECTS All AVSD types usually require surgery. During surgery, any holes in the chambers are closed using patches. If the mitral valve does not close completely, it is repaired or replaced. For complete AVSD, the common valve is separated into two valves—one on the right side and one on the left. The age for surgical repair depends on the child’s health and the specific structure of the AVSD. If possible, surgery should occur before there is permanent damage to the lungs from too much blood pumping to the lungs. Medication may be used to treat heart failure. However, this is only a short-term measure until the infant can grow large enough for surgery. Even if their AVSD is surgically repaired, a child or adult with an AVSD needs regular visits with a cardiologist to: Monitor his or her progress Avoid complications Check for other health conditions that might develop as the child ages With proper treatment, most babies with AVSD grow up to lead healthy, productive lives. Outlook / Prognosis OF ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTIAL DEFECTS Without surgery, children with an AV canal defect may have a life expectancy of two or three years. Some live to be young adults. About 90% of children who have repair surgery have a 10-year survival rate. This means they live for at least another 10 years on average after treatment. About 65% are alive 20 years after surgery. But even after surgery, someone with an atrioventricular canal defect won’t have a typical heart. They’ll need periodic echocardiograms to monitor their heart’s function and catch complications early. The patch over the hole can usually stay in place for the rest of a person’s life. But over time, one of the repaired heart valves may begin to leak. About 10% to 20% of people need a second surgery. After surgery, many people don’t need medications or more operations for their hearts. But cardiac arrhythmias may develop later in life. A provider may recommend minimally invasive procedures like ablation to treat an arrhythmia. Prevention OF ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTIAL DEFECTS There’s no way to prevent an atrioventricular septal defect. But if you’re pregnant, you can reduce the risk of your baby having a congenital heart defect by: Avoiding recreational drugs, alcohol and tobacco products Getting all necessary vaccinations to prevent illness Maintaining a weight that’s healthy for you Managing chronic health conditions Taking prenatal vitamins, including folic acid, as your healthcare provider recommends EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTIAL DEFECTS AVSD accounts for approximately 3% to 7% of all congenital cardiac malformations, with an estimated incidence of 0.24 to 0.31 per 1000 live births. While both sexes are affected, some study results suggest a slight female predominance, particularly in patients with Down syndrome, with a female-to-male ratio of 1.3 to 1.0.The association with trisomy 21 is significant, with 40% to 50% of children with Down syndrome having an AVSD, making it the most common congenital heart defect in this population. Data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons congenital database reported 4138 cases of complete AVSD between 2013 and 2017 when treated with or without valvuloplasty. However, cases requiring valve replacement demonstrated significantly higher perioperative mortality (16.7%). Notably, intraoperative conversions from failed valvuloplasty to valve replacement had a mortality rate as high as 50%, underscoring the critical importance of accurate preoperative imaging and surgical planning to optimize outcomes. The widespread use of prenatal ultrasound and advances in congenital heart disease screening continue to influence reported incidence rates. Still, AVSD remains a common and clinically significant congenital defect, especially in populations with chromosomal abnormalities. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTIAL DEFECTS are: Isolated Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) Typically an ostium secundum or primum ASD without ventricular involvement. Left-to-right shunt at atrial level only. Isolated Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) Left-to-right shunt at ventricular level; may cause similar heart failure symptoms. Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) Continuous “machine-like” murmur; left-to-right shunt from aorta to pulmonary artery. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) Cyanotic congenital heart disease with VSD, pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Pulmonic Stenosis Obstruction at pulmonary valve causing right ventricular hypertrophy and murmur. Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR) Pulmonary veins drain abnormally; presents with cyanosis and heart failure. Congestive Heart Failure from Other Causes Such as cardiomyopathies or myocarditis. Sepsis or Other Non-Cardiac Causes of Tachypnea and Failure to Thrive Important to rule out in infants presenting with respiratory distress. Genetic Associations: AVSD is strongly associated with chromosomal abnormalities and genetic syndromes, most notably Down syndrome (trisomy 21). Key genes on chromosome 21 implicated in AVSD include DSCAM, COL6A1, COL6A2, KCNJ6, and RCAN1, which are important for cardiac development. Syndromic and Nonsyndromic Cases: While AVSD frequently occurs in syndromic contexts (e.g., Down syndrome, heterotaxy syndrome), it can also present as an isolated defect. Familial cases are rare but usually show autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expression. Candidate Genes and Mutations: CRELD1: Mutations in this gene are found in about 9% of partial AVSD cases and are associated with abnormal atrioventricular cushion development. Cilia-related genes: Mutations affecting cilia function and left-right patterning (e.g., Polaris) disrupt cardiac development and cause AVSD, sometimes independent of situs abnormalities. Other genes: Over 100 mutations identified in mouse models suggest a broad range of genetic contributors affecting cardiac septation and valve formation PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTIAL DEFECTS Q. What is an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)? A. AVSD, also called an atrioventricular canal defect or endocardial cushion defect, is a congenital heart defect where there are holes between the heart’s upper chambers (atria) and lower chambers (ventricles), along with abnormalities of the valves that control blood flow between these chambers. Q2. What causes AVSD? A. The exact cause is unknown, but AVSD occurs due to abnormal development of the endocardial cushions during fetal heart formation. It is more common in children with Down syndrome (trisomy 21), occurring in about 25% of these children. Q3. What are the types of AVSD? A. Complete AVSD: Large holes between all four heart chambers and one common atrioventricular valve. Partial AVSD (primum ASD): Smaller defects, usually involving only the atrial septum and two separate but abnormal valves. Transitional AVSD: Features between complete and partial forms. Q4. What symptoms does AVSD cause? A. Symptoms usually appear between 4 and 8 weeks of age and include: Rapid breathing Feeding difficulties Poor weight gain Fatigue and low energy Sweating, especially during feeding If untreated, it can lead to congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Q5. How is AVSD diagnosed? A. Physical exam may reveal a heart murmur. Echocardiography (heart ultrasound) is the key test to visualize the septal defects and valve abnormalities. Chest X-ray and ECG may support diagnosis. Q6. What treatments are available for AVSD? A. Most children require surgical repair, usually before 6 months of age, especially those with complete AVSD. Surgery involves closing the holes and reconstructing the valves. Some partial AVSDs may be monitored if asymptomatic. Q7. What is the prognosis after surgery? A. Surgical outcomes are generally very good, with most children doing well long-term. However, some may develop valve leakage requiring further intervention. Q8. Can children with AVSD participate in normal activities? A. After repair and recovery, children usually have no restrictions and can participate in normal physical activities. Children with Down syndrome may have additional considerations. Q9. Are there any complications to watch for? A. Possible complications include valve leakage, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and the need for additional surgeries. Q10. Is AVSD hereditary? A. Most cases are sporadic, but there is an increased risk in families with genetic syndromes like Down syndrome. Genetic counseling may be recommended. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTIAL DEFECTS Doctor: Hello, I want to talk with you about your child’s heart condition called an atrioventricular septal defect, or AVSD. Parent: What exactly is that? Doctor: AVSD is a congenital heart defect where there are holes between the heart’s upper chambers (atria) and lower chambers (ventricles). Also, the valves that control blood flow between these chambers don’t form properly and instead form one large valve. This causes extra blood to flow to the lungs, which can strain the heart. Parent: How does this affect my child? Doctor: Because of the holes and valve problems, blood flows abnormally inside the heart, leading to too much blood going to the lungs. This can cause symptoms like rapid breathing, poor feeding, fatigue, and eventually heart failure if untreated. Parent: How do you diagnose AVSD? Doctor: We usually hear a heart murmur during a checkup. To confirm, we perform an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart. It shows the size and location of the holes and the valve abnormalities. Parent: Is this common in any particular group? Doctor: AVSD is more common in children with Down syndrome, but it can occur in any child. Parent: What treatment options are there? Doctor: Most children with AVSD need surgery, usually within the first 6 months of life. The surgery closes the holes and repairs the valve. Early surgery helps prevent complications like lung damage and heart failure. Parent: What happens if we don’t treat it? Doctor: Without treatment, the extra blood flow can cause lung damage, heart failure, and other serious problems. Parent: What is the outlook after surgery? Doctor: The prognosis is generally good. Most children recover well and lead healthy lives, though some may need follow-up care for valve function or rhythm problems. Parent: Is there anything we can do at home? Doctor: Keep up with regular checkups, watch for symptoms like rapid breathing or poor feeding, and follow the treatment plan. We’ll support you throughout. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything. Doctor: You’re welcome. Please ask any questions anytime—we’re here to help.

This congenital malformation involves abnormal lung tissue development, leading to a mass or cyst that does not communicate with the normal bronchial tree and receives its blood supply from abnormal vessels. This article briefly explains bronchopulmonary sequestration, its causes, types, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Bronchopulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by the presence of non-functional lung tissue that lacks a connection to the normal airway. Essentially, it is a mass or cyst that receives its blood supply from systemic vessels rather than the pulmonary arteries. This abnormality typically manifests in the lower lobes of the lungs. Causes Bronchopulmonary Sequestration Bronchopulmonary sequestration occurs during fetal development when a portion of the lung tissue becomes isolated from the normal bronchial tree. This non-functional lung tissue then forms a mass that receives its blood supply from systemic vessels rather than the pulmonary artery. Types of Bronchopulmonary Sequestration (BPS) BPS is classified into two main types: intralobar and extralobar. Intralobar Bronchopulmonary Sequestration: This type is more common and has a reported incidence of 75 percent to 86 percent among all sequestration cases. It involves a mass of abnormal lung tissue within a normal lung lobe. Intralobar BPS shares a common pleural covering with the surrounding lung tissue. Extralobar Bronchopulmonary Sequestration: Extralobar BPS is rarer and involves a separate mass of lung tissue with its pleural covering. The mass is often located outside the normal lung tissue, usually in the chest cavity. Symptoms of Bronchopulmonary Sequestration (BPS) The symptoms of BPS may vary depending on the type of bronchopulmonary sequestration. 1. Intralobar Sequestration: Frequently Asymptomatic: Many individuals do not experience any symptoms and are diagnosed incidentally during chest CT (computed tomography) scans. Recurrent Pneumonia: The most common presentation, often affecting a specific area of the lung. Persistent Cough: This can be a chronic symptom, separate from or accompanying pneumonia. Back Pain: This may be associated with the location of the sequestrated tissue. Persistent Exertional Shortness of Breath: Difficulty breathing during physical activity. Hemoptysis: Coughing up blood occurs more frequently than with extralobar sequestration. 2. Extralobar Sequestration: Extralobar sequestration is usually manifested clinically in early infancy with Respiratory Distress: Difficulty breathing, often noticeable soon after birth. High Output Congestive Heart Failure: Caused by a blood flow abnormality. Occasional Spontaneous Pulmonary or Pleural Hemorrhage: Bleeding in the lungs or surrounding space. Rarely Infected: Due to separation from the airway system by surrounding tissue. Bronchopulmonary Sequestration Diagnosis Diagnosing bronchopulmonary sequestration often involves the following: Chest X-ray: Provides initial clues, especially for intralobar sequestration in young patients with recurrent infections. Computed Tomography (CT) Scan: Highly accurate (90 %) for both types of sequestration, especially with 3D reconstruction and contrast. The current gold standard for non-invasive diagnosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MR Angiography (MRA): Similar information to CT scans but less widely used. Ultrasonography: Ideal for prenatal and postnatal settings, especially with color flow and duplex Doppler for identifying abnormal blood supply. Radionuclide Angiography: Demonstrates systemic arterial blood supply to the sequestration, confirming diagnosis. Angiography: This invasive procedure involves injecting a contrast dye into the blood vessels to visualize the blood supply to the anomalous lung tissue. The definitive diagnosis is made by using angiography. Angiography helps differentiate pulmonary sequestration from other abnormalities of the lung. Bleeding in the lungs must be interpreted along with clinical and chest radiographic findings. Doppler Ultrasound: Can detect sequestration as early as 18 to 19 weeks\\' gestation. Possible Complications of Bronchopulmonary Sequestration Bronchopulmonary sequestration can lead to the following complications: Growth abnormalities. Hemoptysis. Hemorrhagic pleural effusion. Recurrent infection is common in intralobar sequestration. Rare cases of extra lobar sequestrations communicating with the GI (gastrointestinal) tract have been reported. They are known as congenital bronchopulmonary foregut malformations (CBPFM). Development of malignant tumors within intralobar sequestration. Treatment of Bronchopulmonary Sequestration The management of bronchopulmonary sequestration depends on various factors, including the patient\\'s age, the presence of symptoms, and the size and location of the sequestration. 1. Early Intervention: Hospitalization and Intensive Care: Specialized treatment is crucial due to potential complications like pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs). Thoracoamniotic Shunting: For fetuses with hydrops (fluid accumulation) before 30 weeks\\' gestation, this procedure helps drain excess fluid. Postnatal Support: Depending on severity, newborns may require ventilator support, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Tube Thoracostomy: This procedure drains large pleural effusions (fluid around the lungs) in severe cases. Surgical Resection: Ultimately, surgery to remove the sequestered tissue is recommended, even for asymptomatic infants, to prevent future infections and inflammation. However, in certain cases with pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension, surgery may be delayed until stabilization occurs. 2. Pulmonary lobectomy: The preferred treatment for symptomatic patients, even in some asymptomatic cases, to avoid complications. 3. Surgery Options: Open Thoracotomy: Traditional open chest surgery approach. Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS): Minimally invasive approach with smaller incisions, leading to potentially faster recovery times and fewer complications. Recent advancements even include uniportal VATS, requiring only one small incision. 4. Endovascular Embolization: This minimally invasive technique involves blocking blood flow to the sequestered tissue using coils or other embolic agents like particles, glue, plugs, or alcohol. This leads to shrinkage and eventual disappearance of the tissue. Differential Diagnosis of Bronchopulmonary Sequestration Symptoms of bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) can mimic many other lung conditions, for example: Cystic adenomatoid malformation (non-cancerous overgrowth of abnormal lung tissue). Bronchogenic cyst (congenital abnormality arising from an abnormal budding of the tracheobronchial tree). Focal bronchiectasis (usually occurs when the bronchi (large airway) become dilated). Congenital lobar emphysema (developmental abnormality of lungs characterized by overinflation of a lung lobe due to a blockage of the airways). Retroperitoneal tumors in extra lobar abdominal sequestrations. Pneumonia Infectious consolidation can mimic sequestration, especially if recurrent or localized. Lung Abscess Cavitary lesion with infection, often with systemic signs. Empyema Pleural fluid collection with infection, may appear as a mass on imaging. Bronchiectasis Dilated bronchi with chronic infection, can appear cystic or mass-like. Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM) (formerly Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation - CCAM) Cystic lung lesion that can resemble sequestration; may coexist as hybrid lesions. Diaphragmatic Hernia Herniation of abdominal contents into thorax, may mimic mass on chest imaging. Tuberculosis Chronic infection causing cavitary or mass-like lesions. Bronchogenic Cyst Congenital cystic lesion, well-circumscribed, usually mediastinal or intrapulmonary. Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) Abnormal vascular connections, can be confused with sequestration vascular supply. Lung Tumors Rare in children but includes inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor or congenital lung tumors. Pneumatocele Air-filled cystic space often post-infectious. Foregut Duplication Cyst Congenital cystic lesion adjacent to the esophagus or bronchus. Pulmonary Infarction or Round Atelectasis Can appear as mass-like opacity on imaging. Neuroblastoma or Other Mediastinal Masses (for infradiaphragmatic or thoracoabdominal lesions) May mimic sequestration on imaging. Epidemiology of Bronchopulmonary Sequestration (BPS): Prevalence and Incidence: BPS is a rare congenital lung malformation, estimated to occur in approximately 0.1% to 0.42 per 10,000 live births based on recent large population studies, such as data from the Chinese Birth Defects Monitoring Network. Other estimates report an incidence ranging from 0.15% to 1.8% of all congenital lung malformations. Some sources cite an incidence of about 1 in 60,000 children. Types and Presentation: Extralobar sequestration (ELS) accounts for most cases diagnosed prenatally and shows a male predominance (historically up to 4:1), though recent data suggest similar prevalence between sexes. Intralobar sequestration (ILS) tends to present later in childhood or adolescence with recurrent infections and is more common in the left lower lobe (about 70% of cases). BPS most commonly involves the left lower lobe, particularly the posterior basal segment. Sex Distribution: Slight male predominance has been reported, especially for extralobar sequestration, with male-to-female ratios around 1.2 to 1.6:1 in some series. Age at Diagnosis: ELS is often diagnosed prenatally or in neonates due to respiratory distress or infection. ILS is frequently diagnosed in late childhood or adulthood after recurrent pulmonary infections PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON BRONCHOPULMONARY SEQUESTRATION Q1. What is bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS)? A. Bronchopulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital lung malformation where a mass of nonfunctioning lung tissue develops without a normal connection to the airways. This tissue receives blood supply abnormally from a systemic artery, usually from the aorta, rather than from the pulmonary arteries. Q2. What are the types of bronchopulmonary sequestration? A. There are two main types: Extralobar sequestration (ELS): The abnormal lung tissue is outside the normal lung and has its own pleural covering. It is often diagnosed in infants and may be associated with other congenital abnormalities. Intralobar sequestration (ILS): The abnormal tissue is located within a normal lung lobe and shares the same pleural covering. It usually presents later in childhood or adulthood with recurrent infections. Q3. How common is bronchopulmonary sequestration? A. BPS is a rare condition, occurring in approximately 0.1% of live births. It most commonly affects the lower lobes of the lungs, especially the left lower lobe. Q4. How is bronchopulmonary sequestration diagnosed? A. BPS is often detected prenatally via ultrasound, which shows a bright mass near the lung with a distinct artery coming from the aorta feeding the lesion. Postnatal diagnosis is confirmed with imaging studies such as CT angiography or MRI to visualize the abnormal lung tissue and its blood supply. Q5. What symptoms does bronchopulmonary sequestration cause? A. Many cases are asymptomatic at birth. Symptoms, when present, may include: Recurrent pneumonia or lung infections Cough Breathing difficulties Chest pain In severe cases, heart failure due to abnormal blood flow Q6. What complications can arise from BPS? A. Infection of the sequestered lung tissue Torsion (twisting) of the extralobar sequestration, which can cause pain and compromise blood flow Compression of normal lung tissue or heart displacement in large lesions Rarely, fetal hydrops (fluid accumulation) and heart failure before birth Q7. How is bronchopulmonary sequestration treated? A. Surgical removal of the sequestered lung tissue is the standard treatment, especially for symptomatic cases or large lesions. Small, asymptomatic extralobar sequestrations may sometimes be monitored without immediate surgery. In rare fetal cases with complications, prenatal interventions or specialized delivery procedures may be necessary. Q8. What is the prognosis for children with BPS? A. With appropriate surgical treatment, most children have an excellent prognosis and normal lung function. Early diagnosis and management help prevent complications such as infections and heart failure. Q9. Can bronchopulmonary sequestration affect pregnancy? A. Large lesions can sometimes impair lung development or cause fluid buildup around the fetus (polyhydramnios or hydrops), which may require close monitoring or fetal intervention. Q10. Is bronchopulmonary sequestration hereditary? A. BPS is a congenital malformation but is generally considered sporadic with no clear hereditary pattern. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON BRONCHOPULMONARY SEQUESTRATION Doctor: Hello, I want to discuss the diagnosis we made for your child. The imaging shows a condition called bronchopulmonary sequestration, or BPS. Parent: What is bronchopulmonary sequestration? Doctor: It’s a rare congenital condition where a small part of lung tissue develops separately from the normal lung. This tissue doesn’t connect to the normal airways, so it doesn’t help with breathing. Instead, it gets its blood supply abnormally from a large artery coming directly from the aorta. Parent: How does this affect my child? Doctor: Often, this extra lung tissue doesn’t cause symptoms at first. But it can sometimes lead to repeated lung infections, cough, or breathing difficulty. In some cases, the mass can press on nearby lung tissue or the heart. Parent: How did you find out about it? Doctor: In many cases, like yours, it’s detected on prenatal ultrasound or after birth with imaging studies such as CT angiography or MRI. These tests help us see the abnormal lung tissue and its blood supply. Parent: What treatment does my child need? Doctor: The standard treatment is surgical removal of the sequestered lung tissue, especially if your child has symptoms or if the mass is large. Surgery usually has excellent outcomes. If the lesion is small and not causing problems, sometimes we monitor it closely. Parent: Are there any risks if we don’t treat it? Doctor: Without treatment, there’s a risk of recurrent infections, inflammation, or complications like torsion, where the blood supply twists and causes pain or damage. Large lesions can also cause problems with lung development or heart function. Parent: What is the outlook after surgery? Doctor: Most children recover well and have normal lung function afterward. Early diagnosis and treatment help prevent complications. Parent: Is this condition hereditary? Could future children have it? Doctor: BPS is generally considered a sporadic congenital condition, meaning it usually happens by chance and is not inherited. The risk for future children is very low. Parent: What should we watch for at home? Doctor: Watch for symptoms like persistent cough, fever, difficulty breathing, or poor feeding. If any of these occur, seek medical attention promptly. Parent: Thank you for explaining. It’s a relief to know more. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’ll support you and your child every step of the way. Please feel free to ask any questions anytime.

Your lymphatic system — a series of vessels similar to your blood vessels — drains extra fluid from your tissues. White blood cells patrol the fluid (lymph) to look for and destroy germs like bacteria and viruses. Chyle is a kind of lymph that comes from your digestive tract. It contains a mix of white blood cells and fats that make it look milky. It moves through your body through your thoracic duct. Your thoracic duct is a tube that moves chyle from your abdomen, up through your chest, to your neck. There, it empties back into your bloodstream. Damage to your thoracic duct can cause it to leak. If it leaks into the space around your lungs, it’s called chylothorax. Types of chylothorax Chylothorax is either traumatic, non-traumatic or idiopathic: Traumatic chylothorax happens when the lymph vessels in your abdomen or chest are damaged by force. This could be during surgery or after an injury. Non-traumatic (spontaneous) chylothorax happens when something blocks your lymph vessels, weakens their walls or causes a buildup of chyle that makes the vessels burst. People who have anatomical differences in their chest can be born with non-traumatic chylothorax (congenital chylothorax). They can also develop it a few days after birth. Idiopathic chylothorax is any kind of chylothorax where your provider can’t find the cause. Symptoms OF Chylothorax The main symptom of chylothorax is shortness of breath. Some people also experience: Chest pressure, tightness or heaviness. Tiredness (fatigue). Unintended weight loss. Common cause of chylothorax Surgery is the most common cause of chylothorax (postoperative chylothorax). But anything that can damage your thoracic duct, which carries chyle, can cause chylothorax. Damage can cause chyle to leak from your lymphatic system into your chest. Other causes include: Injury to your chest or back. This includes blunt trauma injuries (something hitting your body hard) and injuries that break through your skin (like a stab wound). Present at birth. Differences in anatomy and certain illnesses you’re born with can cause chylothorax. Babies either have it at birth (congenital) or develop it in the first few days after birth. Many cancers can block or damage structures in your chest, allowing chyle to leak. This includes lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, Kaposi sarcoma and others. Sometimes, infections can damage the ducts that carry chyle, allowing it to leak. Tuberculosis is the most common cause of this kind of chylothorax. Blockage. Anything that can cause conditions that block your thoracic duct can lead to chylothorax. This includes sarcoidosis, blood clots and goiter. Risk factors for chylothorax You might be at higher risk for chylothorax if you: Had recent surgery to your chest, neck or abdomen. This includes lung and cardiovascular (heart or blood vessel) surgery. Had an injury to your chest or back. Have cancer or a condition that can cause blockages in your chest or buildup in your lymphatic system. Diagnosis and Tests OF Chylothorax After listening to your symptoms and health history, a healthcare provider diagnoses chylothorax with imaging tests and by testing a sample of fluid from your chest. A provider may perform or order these tests to diagnose chylothorax: Imaging. Your provider needs to see pictures of the inside of your chest to know if excess fluid is causing your symptoms. They might use X-rays, ultrasounds or CT scans. Thoracentesis. Your provider might drain fluid from your chest and test it. This tells them more about what the fluid is and what might be causing it to leak. Lymphangiography or lymphoscintigraphy. These are special imaging tests to look at your lymphatic system. Management and Treatment OF Chylothorax How your provider treats chylothorax depends on the cause. They may suggest a special diet or drain the fluid first. If those don’t work, they may use a surgical procedure to seal the leak (lymphangiogram and embolization) or to keep the fluid from leaking again. Treating the underlying cause of chylothorax is the best way to keep it from coming back. Specific therapies that treat chylothorax Your provider may recommend the following treatments: Bowel rest. Your lymph vessels that transport chyle may need a break so they can heal. To do this, your provider will give you all of your nutrition through an IV. This gives your body a rest from breaking down food through your digestive system. Dietary changes. To help give your body a break from digesting fats, a dietitian can guide you through a very low-fat or modified-fat diet. This is only temporary. Limiting healthy fats in your diet for too long can lead to malnutrition. Draining fluid. A provider may drain the fluid from your chest using thoracentesis. They might drain it once or over a short period of time with a chest tube. While it can’t repair damage on its own, this can relieve symptoms while your body heals. Somatostatin or octreotide. These are IV medications that change how your body absorbs fats and nutrients. Providers sometimes use them in combination with other treatments, like diet changes, to help your body heal. Thoracic duct ligation or embolization. If your thoracic duct is damaged or doesn’t work properly, a provider may surgically tie it off (ligation) or purposefully block it (embolization). This can repair damage or redirect the flow of fluid so it doesn’t leak. Pleurodesis. Pleurodesis is a surgical procedure that sticks your lungs to the lining on the inside of your chest wall. This gets rid of the space inside your chest where the fluid is collecting. Outlook / Prognosis OF Chylothorax What you can expect with chylothorax depends on what’s causing it and how well you respond to treatment. Mild leaks can sometimes heal on their own or with temporary dietary changes. But you might need surgery to fix the damage. Ask your provider what to expect in your specific situation. Chylothorax can be life-threatening if left untreated. It can also be caused by serious illnesses. You may need ongoing treatments for underlying illnesses. Living With Chylothorax Your provider may suggest you go on a special diet if you have chylothorax. This includes eating and drinking foods and beverages with very little fat or specific kinds of fats. They may also recommend that you not eat at all. In this case, you’ll get all of your nutrition in an IV, giving your body time to heal. In either case, you should be able to return to your normal diet within a week or two. When to see a doctor See your healthcare provider if you have unexplained shortness of breath, especially if you: Had surgery recently. Had a recent injury to your chest or back. Have a condition that can cause blockages in your chest or neck. Have a condition that affects your lymphatic system. Go to the nearest emergency room if you have trouble breathing, especially if you also have chest pain. This could be a sign of a life-threatening illness. Main Differential Diagnoses for Pediatric Chylothorax: Traumatic Causes: Iatrogenic injury during cardiothoracic surgery (most common cause in children) Chest trauma or thoracic duct injury Congenital/Idiopathic Causes: Congenital lymphatic malformations (e.g., lymphangiomatosis, lymphangiectasia) Syndromic associations: Down syndrome Noonan syndrome Turner syndrome Yellow nail syndrome Hydrops fetalis Idiopathic neonatal chylothorax (most common pleural effusion in newborns) Malignancy-Associated Chylothorax: Lymphoma Leukemia Other mediastinal tumors causing thoracic duct obstruction Infectious Causes: Tuberculosis AIDS-related complex (rare in pediatrics) Cardiac Causes: Congestive heart failure causing pleural effusions that may mimic chylothorax Post-cardiac surgery complications (e.g., after congenital heart defect repair) Other Causes: Gorham-Stout disease (massive osteolysis with associated chylous effusions) Lymphatic obstruction due to thoracic duct thrombosis or malformations Exudative pleural effusions (non-chylous) that can be confused with chylothorax Pseudochylothorax (chylous-like effusion with different biochemical profile) Procedures OF Chylothorax Thoracentesis and pleural fluid analysis are the criterion standards to establish a diagnosis of chylothorax. Alternatively, in a postsurgical patient, tube thoracostomy output can be analyzed. Pleural fluid analysis for triglyceride content helps to confirm the diagnosis of chylothorax. Note the following : A level greater than 110 mg/dL reflects a 99% chance that the fluid is chyle. A level less than 50 mg/dL reflects only a 5% chance that the fluid is chyle. If the level is 50-110 mg/dL, use lipoprotein analysis or inspect the pleural fluid for chylomicrons or cholesterol crystals. A ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to triglyceride of less than 1 is also diagnostic. The concentration of cholesterol in a chylothorax will often be less than 200 mg/dL. A fasting patient may have serous-appearing pleural fluid. To confirm the diagnosis, administer cream through a Naso enteric tube prior to fluid collection. The cream will change the chylous production from serous to the characteristic milky white fluid. This change is diagnostic for a chyle leak. The gold standard for chylothorax diagnosis is detecting chylomicrons within the pleural fluid via lipoprotein electrophoresis. Chylothorax can be distinguished from pseudo chylothorax by fluid analysis. In pseudo chylothorax, the cholesterol level is greater than 200 mg/dL, no chylomicrons are present, and cholesterol crystals are seen on microscopy. There is often a neutrophil-rich exudate with triglyceride levels less than 50 mg/dL Pediatric Chylothorax Epidemiology: Prevalence: Chylothorax is a rare condition in children, with an estimated prevalence of about 1 in 15,000 live births. Postoperative Incidence: The most common cause in pediatrics is postoperative chylothorax, especially following cardiothoracic surgery. The incidence after pediatric cardiac surgery ranges from 0.2% to 6.6%, with many studies reporting around 2–4.5%. Certain surgeries like cavopulmonary bypass have higher rates (up to 11.9%). Etiology Distribution: Approximately 80–90% of pediatric chylothorax cases are post-surgical, mainly after cardiac operations. Primary (congenital or idiopathic) chylothorax accounts for a smaller proportion, including neonatal or congenital cases. Other causes include trauma, malignancy, and lymphatic anomalies. Gender Distribution: Pediatric cases show a nearly equal male-to-female ratio (about 56% male, 44% female), with no significant gender predilection. Age at Presentation: Neonates and infants often present with congenital or idiopathic chylothorax. Postoperative chylothorax typically develops within days after surgery. Morbidity: Chylothorax is an important cause of morbidity and prolonged hospitalization in critically ill children. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Chylothorax Q. What’s the difference between chylothorax and pleural effusion? A. Pleural effusion is any fluid in the pleural space (space between your lungs and your chest wall). Chylothorax is a specific kind of pleural effusion where chyle leaks into the pleural space. Q. What caused this? A. Pediatric chylothorax is caused by leakage of lymphatic fluid (chyle) into the chest cavity. The most common causes in children are: Injury or disruption of the thoracic duct during cardiac surgery (postoperative chylothorax). Congenital lymphatic malformations or abnormalities. Trauma, infections, or rarely tumors that block or damage lymphatic drainage. Q. What are my treatment options? A. Treatment usually starts with conservative measures, including: Chest tube drainage to remove fluid. Dietary modifications such as a low-fat diet enriched with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) or complete bowel rest with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to reduce chyle production. Medications like octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) which helps reduce lymphatic fluid production. If conservative treatment fails (usually after 2 weeks or high output persists), surgical options such as thoracic duct ligation or minimally invasive procedures like video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) are considered. Newer interventional treatments include selective lymphatic duct embolization, which blocks leaking lymphatic vessels with coils or glue. Q. What should/shouldn’t I eat or drink? A. Your child will likely be started on a low-fat diet enriched with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), which are absorbed directly into the bloodstream and reduce lymph flow. In some cases, complete bowel rest with intravenous nutrition (TPN) is necessary to allow the thoracic duct to heal. Avoid long-chain fatty acids and high-fat foods until your doctor advises otherwise. Q. Is there any way to prevent this from happening again? A. Prevention depends on the cause: After surgery, careful surgical technique reduces risk. For congenital or idiopathic cases, close monitoring and early treatment help prevent complications. Avoiding trauma and managing underlying conditions is important. If your child had surgery, your care team will monitor closely to catch any recurrence early. Q. How long will it take to feel better? A. The median time to resolution of chylothorax in children is about 3 weeks (around 21 days) with conservative treatment. Some children recover faster, while others may require longer treatment, especially if surgery or embolization is needed. Recovery also depends on your child’s overall health and the underlying cause. Pediatric Chylothorax Treatment Drugs and Their Side Effects 1. Octreotide Mechanism: Synthetic somatostatin analogue that reduces lymphatic fluid production by causing vasoconstriction in splanchnic circulation and reducing intestinal blood flow. Usage: Administered as subcutaneous injections (20–70 µg/kg/day divided into 3 doses) or intravenous infusion (starting 1–4 µg/kg/hr, titrated up to 10 µg/kg/hr). Typical duration ranges from 3 to 29 days depending on response. Effectiveness: Most pediatric chylothorax cases (about 89%) respond well to octreotide combined with dietary management. Side Effects: Hyperglycemia Hypothyroidism Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, cramps) Necrotizing enterocolitis (rare, especially in neonates) Liver dysfunction Renal impairment (rare) 2. Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) Purpose: Provides bowel rest by eliminating enteral fat intake, reducing chyle production. Usage: Used especially in infants and children with high chyle output or when dietary modification alone is insufficient. Side Effects: Infection risk due to central venous catheter Electrolyte imbalances Liver dysfunction with prolonged use Metabolic bone disease 3. Albumin Replacement Purpose: To replace protein losses from chylous drainage, especially when losses exceed 50 mL/kg/day. Side Effects: Allergic reactions (rare), volume overload if not carefully monitored. 4. Immunoglobulin Transfusion Purpose: To manage hypogammaglobulinemia resulting from loss of immunoglobulins in chyle. Side Effects: Allergic reactions, fever, headache (generally well tolerated). 5. Inotropes (if cardiac dysfunction present) Used selectively if diastolic dysfunction or heart failure complicates the clinical picture. Side effects depend on the specific agent used. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Chylothorax Doctor: Hello, I want to discuss your child’s diagnosis of chylothorax, which means there is lymphatic fluid, called chyle, accumulating in the chest cavity. Parent: What causes this to happen? Doctor: In children, chylothorax most commonly occurs after heart surgery because the lymphatic vessels can get injured during the procedure. It can also happen due to congenital lymphatic abnormalities or rarely from trauma or infections. Parent: What are the treatment options? Doctor: We usually start with conservative treatment, which includes draining the fluid with a chest tube and modifying the diet to reduce fat intake, often using special formulas with medium-chain triglycerides. Sometimes, we give total parenteral nutrition (feeding through an IV) to rest the gut. We also use medications like octreotide to reduce lymph flow. If these measures don’t work after a few weeks, surgery or other interventions may be needed. Parent: Should my child avoid certain foods or drinks? Doctor: Yes, we recommend a low-fat diet with medium-chain triglycerides because these are absorbed differently and reduce the production of chyle. In some cases, we may temporarily stop oral feeding and provide nutrition intravenously. Parent: Can this happen again? How can we prevent it? Doctor: Recurrence is uncommon if the underlying cause is treated effectively. After surgery, careful monitoring helps catch any problems early. For congenital cases, ongoing follow-up is important. Preventing trauma and managing infections also help. Parent: How long will it take for my child to get better? Doctor: Most children improve within 3 to 4 weeks with conservative treatment. Some may take longer, especially if surgery is required. We will monitor your child closely to ensure the best outcome. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything. Doctor: You’re welcome. Please let us know if you have any questions or if your child’s symptoms change. REFERENCES Chylothorax: Causes, Symptoms & Treatment https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/172527-treatment https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459206/ CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare condition that happens in a baby before birth. It occurs early in pregnancy when a baby\\'s diaphragm — the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen — fails to close as it should. This leaves a hole in the diaphragm. The hole is called a hernia. This hernia in the muscle of the diaphragm creates an opening between the abdomen and the chest. The intestines, stomach, liver and other abdominal organs may move through the hole into the baby\\'s chest. If the intestines are in the chest, they don\\'t develop the typical connections that hold them in place in the abdomen (malrotation). They may twist on themselves, cutting off their blood supply (volvulus). In addition, the lung is small on the side of the diaphragm with the hernia, but the development of both lungs is affected. The air sacs (alveoli) inside the lungs don\\'t develop as they should. This results in problems with blood flow and increased pressure inside the lung\\'s blood vessels. The blood pressure in the lungs is higher than it should be, which can make it hard for the baby to breathe after birth. Some infants may also have problems with heart development. Treatment of CDH depends on when the condition is found, how serious it is and whether there are problems with the heart. Causes OF CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA In most cases, the cause of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not known. In some cases, CDH can be linked to a genetic disorder or random gene changes called mutations. In these cases, the baby may have more issues at birth, such as problems with the heart, eyes, arms and legs, or stomach and intestines. Complications OF CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA Complications that can occur with CDH include: Lung problems. Stomach, intestine and liver problems. Heart disease. Recurrent infections. Hearing loss. Changes in the shape of the chest and curve of the spine. Gastroesophageal reflux — stomach acid flowing back into the tube called the esophagus, which connects the mouth and stomach. Problems with growth and weight gain. Developmental delays and learning disabilities. Other problems present from birth. Symptoms OF CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ranges in severity. It may be mild and have few or no effects on the baby, or it can be more serious and affect the ability to bring oxygen to the rest of the body. Babies born with CDH may have: Severe trouble breathing due to small lungs that don\\'t work well (pulmonary hypoplasia). A type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart (pulmonary hypertension). Problems with development of the heart. Damage to the intestines, stomach, liver and other abdominal organs if they move through the hernia into the chest. When to see a doctor CDH may be found during a routine fetal ultrasound. Your health care provider can discuss treatment options with you. Diagnosis OF CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is most often found during a routine fetal ultrasound exam that\\'s done before your baby is born. A prenatal ultrasound exam uses sound waves to make images of your uterus and baby. Occasionally, the diagnosis may not be made until after birth. Rarely, CDH may not be diagnosed until childhood or later. This may be because there are no signs or symptoms or because signs and symptoms such as respiratory and intestinal problems are mild. Your health care provider uses prenatal ultrasound and other tests to track the growth and function of your baby\\'s lungs, heart and other organs during your pregnancy. Prenatal ultrasound Usually, you have your first fetal ultrasound during the first few months (first trimester) of your pregnancy. It confirms that you are pregnant and shows the number and size of your baby or babies. Most often, you have another ultrasound during months four to six (second trimester) of your pregnancy. Your health care provider checks the growth and development of your baby. Your provider looks at the size and location of your baby\\'s lungs, heart and other organs. If your baby shows signs of CDH, your provider may have you get ultrasound exams more often. This can show how severe CDH is and whether it\\'s getting worse. Other tests More tests may be done to assess the function of your baby\\'s organs. These may include: Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is a medical imaging technique that uses a magnetic field and computer-generated radio waves to create detailed images of the organs and tissues in the baby\\'s body. Fetal echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to produce images of the baby\\'s heart beating and pumping blood. The images from an echocardiogram can identify problems with the developing heart. Genetic tests. Genetic testing can identify genetic syndromes or other gene changes that are sometimes associated with CDH. Genetic counseling can help you understand these test results and give you more information about your baby\\'s condition. Treatment OF CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA Treatment of congenital diaphragmatic hernia depends on when the condition is found and how serious it is. Your health care team helps you decide what\\'s best for you and your baby. Care before delivery Your health care team watches you closely before your baby is born. You typically have ultrasounds and other tests often to check your baby\\'s health and development. An emerging treatment for severe CDH now being studied is called fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO). This surgery is done on your baby while you\\'re still pregnant. The goal is to help the baby\\'s lungs grow as much as possible before birth. FETO is done in two procedures: First procedure. The first procedure happens early in the last few months (third trimester) of your pregnancy. Your surgeon makes a small incision in your abdomen and uterus. The surgeon inserts a special tube with a camera at the end, called a fetal endoscope, through your baby\\'s mouth and into the windpipe (trachea). A small balloon is placed in your baby\\'s trachea and inflated. The natural uterine fluid during pregnancy, called amniotic fluid, flows in and out of your baby\\'s lungs through the mouth. Inflating the balloon keeps amniotic fluid in your baby\\'s lungs. The fluid expands the lungs to help them develop. Second procedure. After about 4 to 6 weeks, you have a second procedure. The balloon is removed so that your baby is ready to take air into the lungs after birth. A special delivery method may be used if labor starts before the balloon has been removed and removal of the balloon with an endoscope is not possible. This method is called an ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure. The delivery is done by C-section with placental support. This means that your baby continues to get oxygen through the placenta before the umbilical cord is cut. Placental support continues until the balloon is out and a breathing tube is in place, allowing a machine to take over breathing. FETO may not be the right choice for everyone. And there\\'s no guarantee about the results of surgery. Your health care team evaluates you and your baby to see whether you may be candidates for this surgery. Talk to your team about the benefits and possible complications for you and your baby. Care during delivery Usually, you can deliver your baby either vaginally or by C-section. You and your health care provider decide which method is best for you. Care after delivery After birth, the health care team helps you plan treatment that meets your baby\\'s needs. Your baby will likely be cared for in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU). Your baby may need to have a breathing tube. The tube is attached to a machine that helps your baby breathe. This gives the lungs and heart time to grow and develop. Babies who have life-threatening lung problems may need a treatment called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This is also known as extracorporal life support (ECLS). The ECMO machine does the work of your baby\\'s heart and lungs, allowing these organs to rest and heal. How long your baby needs support to breathe depends on the response to treatment and other factors. Most babies who have CDH have surgery to close the hole in the diaphragm. When this surgery takes place depends on your baby\\'s health and other factors. Follow-up care to ensure the repair remains in place usually includes chest X-rays. After leaving the hospital, your baby may need extra support. This can include supplemental oxygen. Oxygen is delivered by thin plastic tubing with prongs that fit into the nostrils or thin tubing connected to a mask worn over the nose and mouth. Feeding support may also be needed to help with growth and development. Medicine may be given for conditions associated with CDH, such as acid reflux or pulmonary hypertension. Regular follow-up appointments with your child\\'s health care provider can address any problems early. Outlook / Prognosis ON CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA The reported survival rate for babies born with CDH has improved. Between 7 and 9 out of every 10 babies survive. These babies are born critically ill, but for those who make it through the tense early days of their condition, the outlook gets better. Some children may have long-term complications, but they’ll still live long and full lives. Continuing advances in medicine improve the odds of both short-term survival and long-term health. The longer-term prognosis depends on several factors, including: If your baby was born prematurely How severe your baby’s condition is at birth The size of the hernia What organs are involved Other health conditions Babies who require breathing or feeding support for longer have a higher risk of ongoing complications, including chronic lung disease, growth failure, hearing loss and developmental delays. Your child’s provider will monitor them closely throughout their early life. Diagnostic Considerations OF CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA Special concerns Using ultrasonography, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) may be prenatally diagnosed as early as the second trimester. [15] Suggestive findings include polyhydramnios, an absent or intrathoracic stomach bubble, and mediastinal and cardiac shift. A detailed examination (level II ultrasonography) is typically necessary. Prenatal diagnosis allows for chromosomal analysis and screening for other anomalies prior to the infant\\'s birth. In addition, it allows the mother time to make important decisions about the pregnancy, including delivery in a facility with a neonatal ICU (NICU) that offers advanced respiratory support for the newborn infant. Developing meaningful prognostic information before birth continues to be difficult. Some advocate for assessment of lung hypoplasia using ultrasound measurements of liver herniation into the thorax, lung to head ratios (LHR), or pulmonary artery to aorta ratios (modified McGoon index). MRI of the fetus is a promising technique that allows more precise measurement of the lung volume indexed to the body volume. Differential Diagnoses OF CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA Bronchopulmonary Sequestration Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation Disorders of the Thoracic Cavity and Pleura Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN) Pneumothorax Imaging Epidemiology OF CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA International data Congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs in 1 of every 2000-3000 live births and accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. The risk of recurrence of isolated (i.e., non-syndromic) congenital diaphragmatic hernia in future siblings is approximately 2%. Familial congenital diaphragmatic hernia is rare (< 2% of all cases), and both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant patterns of inheritance have been reported. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a recognized finding in Cornelia de Lange syndrome and also occurs as a prominent feature of Fryns syndrome, an autosomal re Sex- and age-related demographics Most studies report that congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs equally in males and females. Although congenital diaphragmatic hernia is usually a disorder of the newborn period, as many as 10% of patients may present after the newborn period and even during adulthood. A 2020 retrospective analysis of 2015-2018 data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database found 110 adult patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who underwent surgical correction. Outcome in patients with late presentation of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is extremely good, with low or no mortality. Recessive disorder with variable features, including diaphragmatic hernia, cleft lip or palate, and distal digital hypoplasia. Procedures OF CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are required in all infants with severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia who present in the first hours of life. If the diagnosis is known at the time of delivery, avoid bag-and-mask ventilation in the delivery room because the stomach and intestines become distended with air and further compromise pulmonary function. A nasogastric tube should be placed as soon as possible to provide intestinal decompression. As discussed in Treatment, the goal is to adequately expand the lung but to avoid overdistension; therefore, inspiratory pressures should be kept as low as possible. Consider the use of high-frequency ventilation (HFV) if high inspiratory pressures are required. Place an indwelling catheter in the umbilical artery or in a peripheral artery (radial, posterior tibial) for continuous blood pressure and frequent ABG monitoring. Place a venous catheter via the umbilical vein to allow for administration of inotropic agents and hypertonic solutions such as calcium gluconate. If the liver is in the chest, the catheter will likely not pass through the ductus venosus, and another route must be considered for central venous access. The use of HFV in congenital diaphragmatic hernia remains controversial, and no randomized studies indicate a clear benefit. However, HFV may allow for use of lower ventilator pressures and may help normalize PaCO2. Mean airway pressures should be carefully adjusted to avoid lung overdistension. Frequent radiograph (with a goal of 8-9 rib expansion of the contralateral lung) may help in the ongoing assessment and optimization of lung expansion. Venoarterial or venovenous ECMO support is an adaptation of cardiopulmonary bypass and involves a surgical team ; insertion of catheters into the internal jugular vein, internal carotid artery, or both; systemic heparinization; and oxygenation through the use of an artificial membrane lung. Because of its complexity and resource expense, ECMO is available at fewer than 100 centers in the United States. The overall survival rate for infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia reported to the international Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry is approximately 52%, which is the lowest rate in all the neonatal conditions treated with ECMO. Although no conclusive evidence shows that ECMO improves survival or outcome for infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, it remains a commonly used therapy for severely affected infants.

Cardiovascular Support Inotropes and Vasopressors (e.g., Dopamine, Dobutamine, Norepinephrine) Used to maintain adequate systemic blood pressure and cardiac output. Side effects: Tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypertension, peripheral ischemia. 4. Other Supportive Medications Diuretics (e.g., Furosemide) To manage fluid overload and pulmonary edema. Side effects: Electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, nephrotoxicity. Antibiotics Used prophylactically or to treat infections; choice depends on clinical scenario. Types of Genetic Causes Chromosomal abnormalities: Aneuploidies and structural chromosomal variants are common. For example, deletions or duplications at regions such as 15q26, 8p23.1, 8q23, 5p15.2, 16p11.2, 17q12, and 1q41-42 have been associated with CDH. Single-gene mutations: Mutations in genes involved in diaphragm development and related pathways have been identified. Examples include LONP1, MYRF, and genes affecting retinoid (vitamin A) signaling pathways. Syndromic associations: CDH occurs as part of several genetic syndromes, including: Pallister-Killian syndrome Fryns syndrome Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome Cornelia de Lange syndrome Donnai-Barrow syndrome Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome CHARGE syndrome Denys-Drash syndrome Apert syndrome Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome Genetic Mechanisms: CDH results from disruptions in embryonic diaphragm formation, involving multiple genes that regulate cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Many mutations affect transcription factors, cell structural proteins, or signaling pathways critical for diaphragm and lung development. Inheritance Patterns: Most isolated CDH cases are not inherited and occur sporadically. When CDH is part of a syndrome, inheritance follows the pattern of that syndrome (autosomal dominant, recessive, or chromosomal). Familial recurrence is rare but possible. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA Q1. What is congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)? A. CDH is a birth defect where there is a hole in the diaphragm, allowing abdominal organs like the stomach, intestines, or liver to move into the chest. This can prevent the lungs from developing properly, leading to breathing difficulties after birth. Q2. How is CDH diagnosed? A. CDH is often diagnosed before birth during a routine prenatal ultrasound. After birth, chest X-rays and other imaging tests confirm the diagnosis. Sometimes it is diagnosed after birth if the baby has breathing problems. Q3. What causes CDH? A. The exact cause is unknown but it occurs during fetal development when the diaphragm does not close completely. Some cases are associated with genetic syndromes or chromosomal abnormalities. Q4. What are the treatment options for CDH? A. Treatment usually involves: Stabilizing the baby after birth with respiratory support, including oxygen or mechanical ventilation. In severe cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be used to support the lungs and heart. Surgical repair to move the abdominal organs back into the abdomen and close the diaphragm defect, usually after the baby is stable. Q5. What is the outlook for babies with CDH? A. Outcomes vary depending on the severity of lung underdevelopment and other complications. Many babies survive and go on to lead healthy lives, especially with specialized care and follow-up. Q6. What kind of follow-up care is needed? A. Long-term follow-up is important to monitor lung function, growth, development, and potential complications like asthma, feeding difficulties, or scoliosis. Specialized multidisciplinary programs provide ongoing care. Q7. Can CDH be detected or treated before birth? A. Yes, prenatal ultrasounds can detect CDH. In some severe cases, fetal interventions like fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) may be offered to help the lungs grow before birth. Q8. Will my child have developmental delays? A. Some children with CDH may experience developmental delays or learning difficulties, but many develop normally. Early intervention and therapies can help support development. Q9. How can families prepare for the birth of a baby with CDH? A. Families are encouraged to work closely with a specialized fetal care team to plan delivery at a center experienced in CDH care. Support services and counseling are important throughout. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA Doctor: Hello, I’d like to talk with you about your baby’s diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, or CDH. Have you heard about this condition before? Parent: Not really. What exactly is it? Doctor: CDH is a birth defect where there is a hole in the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. Because of this hole, some abdominal organs like the stomach or intestines can move into the chest and affect lung development. This can make breathing difficult after birth. Parent: How did this happen? Did we do something wrong? Doctor: No, this happens very early during fetal development, and it’s not caused by anything you did. Sometimes it’s related to genetic factors, but often the exact cause is unknown. Parent: What will happen now? How do you treat it? Doctor: After birth, we will support your baby’s breathing with oxygen or a ventilator if needed. In severe cases, we might use a machine called ECMO to support the heart and lungs temporarily. Once your baby is stable, we plan to do surgery to move the organs back into the abdomen and close the hole in the diaphragm. Parent: Is surgery risky? Will my baby be okay? Doctor: Surgery does carry risks, but it’s necessary to help your baby breathe better. The timing depends on how stable your baby is. Many babies do very well with surgery and specialized care, but some may have ongoing challenges. We’ll monitor your baby closely and provide all the support needed. Parent: How long will my baby stay in the hospital? Doctor: It varies depending on the severity, but babies with CDH often need several weeks to months in the hospital, including time for breathing support and recovery after surgery. Parent: Will my child have problems later in life? Doctor: Some children may have issues like asthma, feeding difficulties, or developmental delays, but many grow up healthy and active. We’ll arrange follow-up care to monitor and support your child’s growth and development. Parent: Is there anything I should do to prepare? Doctor: We encourage you to ask questions and share any concerns. We’ll help you understand each step and connect you with support services. Planning delivery at a specialized center with experienced teams is important. Parent: Thank you for explaining. It helps to know what to expect. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’re here to support you and your baby throughout this journey. Please feel free to reach out anytime with questions or concerns. REFERENCES Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH): What Parents Need To Know Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) - Diagnosis and treatment - Mayo Clinic https://emedicine.medscape.com/%20https:/emedicine.medscape.com/article/978118-workup#c6 CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) is a rare lung malformation that occurs when air become trapped in the lungs. Infants with CLE have one or more lobes of the lung that are hyperinflated. An obstruction of one of the main airways of the lungs — called the bronchi — can cause CLE in some newborns. However, experts suggest the condition may have a genetic link. The severity of CLE can vary among people, and some may not experience symptoms until adulthood. Doctors typically diagnose the condition in the first 6 months of an infant’s life. However, CLE is very rare, occurring in about 1 in 20,000 to 30,000 births. About a third of newborns with CLE have symptoms at birth. CAUSES OF CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA The exact cause of CLE is not always clear — around 50% of cases occur without doctors knowing the cause. Some infants with CLE have issues with cartilage formation in the bronchi, the passageways into the lungs. This can lead to issues with lung development — they may either under develop or develop atypically — which may cause air to stay trapped in the lungs. Other possible causes of CLE include: diseases of the parenchyma, the cells responsible for lung function a blockage from inside the bronchi a blockage from outside the bronchi Signs and symptoms OF CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA Around 50% of newborns with CLE have symptoms at birth or within the first 6 months of life. Symptoms may include: blue or gray tinge to the skin due to a lack of oxygen the chest sinking below the neck or breastbone during breathing wheezing difficulty feeding or breathing frequent respiratory tract infections chronic cough What other conditions have similar symptoms? Some conditions with similar symptoms to CLE include: bronchial asthma pneumonia respiratory distress syndrome in infants cor pulmonale, or altered function in the right side of the heart that can occur following respiratory disease alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic condition that affects the liver and lungs tension pneumothorax, when air becomes trapped between the lung and chest wall other congenital diseases, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia or congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation pneumatocele when air pockets or cysts develop within the lung parenchyma following injury or trauma lung hypoplasia, another rare, congenital condition of the lungs Considering the above when diagnosing CLE helps doctors determine the best treatment plan. Diagnosis OF CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA Diagnosing CLE involves a physical exam of the lungs and medical imaging. Part of the physical exam involves the doctor tapping the chest to hear sounds within the lungs. The doctor may notice hyper-resonance, which involves a low-pitched, booming sound upon examination. This typically indicates that a particular area of the lung is masking respiratory sounds. Doctors regard a lung CT as the best method for imaging and diagnosing CLE. Another imaging technique that can provide valuable information is an MRI. In infants, MRI can provide detailed images that could potentially evaluate and identify abnormalities. An ultrasound during pregnancy cannot diagnose CLE. In some cases, ultrasound experts may still notice lung areas with an exaggerated response to sound waves with typical blood flow in the area. Doctors could also confirm a diagnosis before birth with MRI since it can show more detail in the fetal lung. Differential diagnosis OF CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA Before treating CLE, doctors need to rule out other conditions that may be causing similar symptoms. Many different respiratory diseases may resemble CLE, as mentioned in the section above. A chest X-ray showing hyperinflated lung lobes can suggest several diagnoses: pneumothorax, or collapsed lung pneumatocele lung hypoplasia Performing a differential diagnosis is the process doctors use to make a final diagnosis. They collect data, consider the most likely cause, and eliminate other less likely options. Treatment OF CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA Once a doctor establishes a diagnosis of CLE, they will choose the most appropriate treatment. These strategies can depend on the severity of the disease. Conservative treatment For mild to moderate disease, doctors prescribe conservative treatments, such as oxygen and bronchodilators, to help open the airways and improve breathing. Follow-up appointments with specialists, such as a respirologist, may be beneficial. Overall conservative treatment can provide favorable results for some. Surgery In severe CLE, newborns may require surgery to remove the lung lobe with CLE. Doctors refer to the removal of a lung lobe as a lobectomy, which typically provides positive results for newborns with severe CLE. Outlook OF CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA With appropriate treatment, the outlook for CLE is generally favorable Sometimes, the condition is so severe it can affect the cardiovascular system, which may affect the prognosis. However, treatments may improve both respiratory and cardiac problems. Epidemiology of CLE: Incidence and Prevalence: CLE is a rare congenital lung malformation, estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 30,000 live births. It accounts for about 5% of all congenital cystic lung lesions. Age at Presentation: Most cases present in early infancy, often within the first six months of life, with respiratory distress or recurrent respiratory infections. Some mild cases may be diagnosed later or incidentally. Sex Distribution: CLE shows a male predominance, with a male-to-female ratio reported around 3:1 in some series. Lobar Involvement: The left upper lobe is most commonly affected, followed by the right middle lobe and right upper lobe. Associated Anomalies: CLE may occasionally be associated with congenital heart defects or other congenital anomalies, but most cases are isolated. Prognosis: With early diagnosis and appropriate management, prognosis is generally good. Surgical lobectomy is curative in symptomatic cases. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA Q. What is congenital lobar emphysema (CLE)? A. CLE is a rare lung condition present at birth where one or more lobes of the lung become overinflated with air. This causes the affected lobe to expand abnormally, compressing the remaining lung tissue and making breathing difficult. Q2. How common is CLE and when does it usually present? A. CLE is uncommon, occurring in about 1 in 20,000 to 30,000 live births. Most infants show symptoms within the first 6 months of life, often presenting with respiratory distress. Q3. What causes CLE? A. The exact cause is often unknown. It is thought to result from partial obstruction of the lobar bronchus due to intrinsic factors like bronchomalacia or extrinsic compression by blood vessels or cysts. About 50% of cases have no identifiable cause. Q4. What symptoms does CLE cause? A. Common symptoms include: Rapid breathing or respiratory distress Wheezing and coughing Cyanosis (bluish skin) Difficulty feeding Q5. How is CLE diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is made through: Chest X-ray showing hyperinflation of the affected lobe and mediastinal shift Chest CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions Sometimes prenatal ultrasound detects lung abnormalities, but diagnosis is usually postnatal Q6. What are the treatment options? A. Mild or moderate cases: May be managed conservatively with close observation, oxygen, and bronchodilators if needed. Some asymptomatic cases may improve without surgery. Severe or progressive cases: Surgical removal of the affected lobe (lobectomy) is the standard treatment and usually results in excellent outcomes. Q7. What are the risks of misdiagnosis? A. CLE can be mistaken for pneumothorax or other lung conditions, leading to inappropriate treatments like chest tube insertion, which can worsen the condition. Q8. What is the prognosis after treatment? A. With appropriate management, especially surgical lobectomy in symptomatic patients, the prognosis is generally very good. Most children recover fully without long-term lung problems. Q9. Can CLE affect other parts of the body? A. In about 10–15% of cases, CLE may be associated with cardiovascular abnormalities, so cardiac evaluation is often recommended. Q10. Is CLE hereditary or preventable? A. CLE is usually sporadic with no known hereditary pattern and cannot be prevented. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA Doctor: Hello, I want to talk with you about your baby’s lung condition called congenital lobar emphysema, or CLE. Parent: What exactly is that? Doctor: CLE is a rare condition where one of the lobes of the lung becomes overinflated with air. This happens because the airway to that lobe is partially blocked or narrowed, causing air to get trapped. This overinflation can press on the rest of the lung and make it harder for your baby to breathe. Parent: How did this happen? Is it something we caused? Doctor: No, CLE is a congenital condition, meaning it develops before birth. It’s usually due to abnormal development of the airways or surrounding tissues. It’s not caused by anything you did during pregnancy. Parent: What symptoms should we expect? Doctor: Babies with CLE often have fast or difficult breathing, wheezing, or coughing. Sometimes they have bluish skin from lack of oxygen or trouble feeding. Symptoms usually appear in the first few weeks or months of life. Parent: How do you diagnose it? Doctor: We use chest X-rays and sometimes CT scans to see the overinflated lobe and how it’s affecting the rest of the lungs. These images help us confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment. Parent: What treatment does my baby need? Doctor: If your baby has mild symptoms, we may watch closely and provide supportive care like oxygen. For babies with more severe breathing problems, surgery to remove the affected lobe, called a lobectomy, is usually recommended. Surgery often leads to excellent improvement. Parent: Is surgery risky? Doctor: Like any surgery, there are risks, but lobectomy for CLE is generally safe and effective. It can be lifesaving if the overinflated lobe is causing serious breathing difficulties. Parent: What is the outlook after treatment? Doctor: Most babies do very well after surgery and have normal lung function as they grow. Even babies managed without surgery often improve over time. Parent: Can this happen again or affect other parts of the body? Doctor: CLE usually affects only one lobe and does not recur after surgery. Sometimes it’s associated with heart defects, so we may do heart evaluations as well. Parent: What should we watch for at home? Doctor: Watch for signs of breathing difficulty like rapid breathing, grunting, blue lips, or poor feeding. If you notice these, seek medical attention promptly. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’re here to support you and your baby. Please feel free to ask any questions anytime. REFERENCES https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560602/#article-21038.s4 Diaphragmatic Paralysis DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities. It plays a crucial role in the respiratory system, in particular with breathing. During inhalation, it contracts and flattens, increasing the volume of the chest cavity and allowing the lungs to expand and fill with air. During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes and returns to its dome shape, resulting in the expulsion of air from the lungs. It accounts for approximately 70-80% of the effort required for breathing under normal conditions. Diaphragmatic paralysis is a condition characterized by the impairment or loss of function in the diaphragm, the primary muscle responsible for respiration. It can be bilateral or unilateral, with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis being more common. It can lead to a significant reduction in lung capacity and respiratory efficiency. Resulting symptoms include shortness of breath, especially when lying down, reduced exercise tolerance, and, in severe cases, respiratory challenges. Causes of Diaphragmatic Paralysis Understanding the causes of diaphragmatic paralysis is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective management of affected individuals. Neurological Injuries Diaphragmatic paralysis can arise from various neurological causes, with nerve damage being a primary factor. The phrenic nerve, which originates from the cervical spinal cord (C3-C5), plays a crucial role in innervating the diaphragm. Damage to this nerve can result in impaired diaphragmatic function or paralysis. Common causes of phrenic nerve injury include surgical complications, particularly from procedures involving the neck or chest, such as cardiac surgery or neck dissections. Trauma, including blunt or penetrating injuries to the neck or upper chest, can also lead to phrenic nerve damage. Neurological Conditions Certain medical conditions can also affect the phrenic nerve. Tumors or masses in the neck or mediastinum can compress the nerve, leading to dysfunction. Neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS) can also result in diaphragmatic paralysis. Viral Infections Infections, such as viral neuropathies, have also been reported as possible causes. Herpes zoster, Zika, poliovirus, and other viral infections have all been linked to diaphragmatic paralysis, particularly unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Autoimmune Conditions Guillain-Barré syndrome is an autoimmune attack on the nervous system, which has been linked to diaphragmatic paralysis Muscular Disorders Diseases that affect muscle function, such as muscular dystrophy, can lead to diaphragmatic weakness or paralysis. These genetic conditions, which include Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies, cause progressive muscle degeneration, including the diaphragm. Over time, respiratory function may be significantly compromised, necessitating ventilatory support. In approximately 20% of cases, the cause of diaphragmatic paralysis is unknown (idiopathic diaphragm paralysis). In these instances, the underlying reason for the paralysis remains unknown despite extensive investigation. Idiopathic diaphragmatic paralysis can pose diagnostic and management challenges, as the absence of a clear etiology makes targeted treatment difficult. Symptoms OF Diaphragmatic paralysis Diaphragmatic paralysis can present with a range of symptoms, primarily affecting respiratory function. Common symptoms include: Shortness of Breath (dyspnea): This is often more pronounced when lying flat due to the upward pressure of abdominal contents on the paralyzed diaphragm, reducing lung capacity. Difficulty Breathing: Patients may struggle to breathe, especially during physical activity. Fatigue: Reduced oxygenation due to impaired lung function can lead to a feeling of tiredness and decreased exercise tolerance. Sleep Disturbances: Breathing difficulties may worsen during sleep, leading to conditions such as sleep apnea or insomnia. Elevated Hemidiaphragm: This may be observed on physical examination or imaging, as the affected side of the diaphragm moves abnormally or not at all. Recurrent Pneumonia DIAGNOSIS OF Diaphragmatic paralysis The diagnostic process for diaphragmatic paralysis involves a combination of clinical evaluation and imaging studies. Chest X-rays and ultrasound are commonly used to visualize the position and movement of the diaphragm. These imaging tests can reveal elevation of the affected hemidiaphragm and reduced or paradoxical movement during respiration. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are also crucial in assessing the impact of diaphragmatic paralysis on respiratory capacity and function. PFTs measure the overall performance of the lungs and can indicate reduced lung capacity due to diaphragmatic dysfunction. Specialized tests like the sniff test may be done. A sniff test is a fluoroscopic examination that observes the movement of the diaphragm during a forced sniff. Paralysis is indicated by paradoxical upward movement during a sharp inhalation. Phrenic nerve stimulation studies may be done. These assess the integrity and function of the phrenic nerve and can provide further diagnostic information. In some cases, electromyography (EMG) of the diaphragm may be performed to evaluate muscle and nerve function. Treatment Options for Diaphragmatic Paralysis The treatment for diaphragmatic paralysis depends on the severity of the condition and the underlying cause. In asymptomatic or mild cases, observation and regular monitoring may be sufficient, especially if the paralysis is expected to be temporary or if it does not significantly impact respiratory function. Patients should undergo periodic evaluations, including pulmonary function tests and imaging studies, to monitor the progression of the condition. Physical therapy plays a crucial role in the management of diaphragmatic paralysis. Respiratory therapists can guide patients through exercises designed to strengthen the accessory muscles of respiration, thereby compensating for diaphragmatic weakness. Breathing techniques, such as diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing, can also help improve ventilation and oxygenation. For more severe cases of diaphragmatic paralysis, surgical treatments may be considered. Diaphragm plication is a procedure that involves folding and suturing the weakened portion of the diaphragm to reduce its volume and increase its tension. This can improve lung expansion and overall respiratory function. In cases where the phrenic nerve is damaged, phrenic nerve repair or stimulation may be attempted to restore diaphragmatic function. Respiratory support is often necessary for patients with significant breathing difficulties. Mechanical ventilation may be required in acute settings or for those with severe respiratory challenges. Non-invasive ventilation, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), can be used to support breathing in less severe cases or as a long-term management strategy. Living with Diaphragmatic Paralysis Living with diaphragmatic paralysis requires adjustments and careful management to maintain quality of life and respiratory health. Patients should engage in regular physical activity tailored to their capacity, as exercise can improve cardiovascular health and strengthen respiratory muscles. Breathing exercises, such as diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing, are essential for enhancing lung function and ensuring efficient ventilation. These exercises can be practiced daily and incorporated into routine activities. Lifestyle adjustments, such as avoiding heavy meals that can press against the diaphragm and maintaining a healthy weight to reduce respiratory strain, are beneficial. Sleeping positions may also need modification, with some individuals finding relief in sleeping with the head elevated to ease breathing. Regular medical follow-ups are crucial for monitoring respiratory function and adjusting treatment as necessary. PFTs, imaging studies, and consultations with respiratory therapists can provide valuable insights into the management of diaphragmatic paralysis. Patients should also be vigilant for signs of respiratory infections or complications and seek medical attention as needed. Emerging Research and Therapies Emerging research and therapies for diaphragmatic paralysis are focused on innovative approaches to restore diaphragm function and enhance nerve regeneration. One area of interest is the use of diaphragmatic pacing, a technique that involves electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve to induce diaphragm contractions. This method has shown promise in improving respiratory function in patients with diaphragmatic paralysis, especially in those with spinal cord injuries or neurodegenerative diseases. Another promising avenue is the field of regenerative medicine, where researchers are exploring the potential of stem cell therapy and growth factors to repair or regenerate damaged phrenic nerves. Animal studies have demonstrated the ability of certain stem cells to promote nerve regeneration and improve diaphragmatic function. While still in the experimental stage, these findings offer hope for clinical applications in humans. Advancements in surgical techniques, such as the use of minimally invasive techniques for diaphragm plication, and new procedures, such as nerve transfer surgery, are also being used more commonly. Nerve transfer surgery involves rerouting healthy nerves to the phrenic nerve to restore diaphragm function. Early results have been encouraging, with some patients experiencing significant improvements in respiratory function. Additionally, research is being conducted on the use of biomaterials and scaffolds to support nerve regeneration and diaphragm repair. These materials aim to provide a conducive environment for nerve growth and tissue healing, potentially enhancing the recovery of diaphragmatic function. Diagnostic Considerations OF Diaphragmatic paralysis The following diagnoses may be difficult to differentiate from bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis (BDP): Diaphragmatic relaxation can occur in which the muscles are thin but no injury is seen to the nerves Alveolar hypoventilation is caused by brainstem or high cervical spine disease; patients have normal respiratory muscle strength and can voluntarily hyperventilate to lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) Anterior horn cells and neuromuscular junction diseases may be difficult to differentiate from phrenic nerve dysfunction Epidemiology OF Diaphragmatic paralysis The exact incidence of diaphragmatic paralysis has not been defined. However, like diaphragm eventration, it is known to be more common among males Prognosis OF Diaphragmatic paralysis Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis Depending on the etiology of the diaphragmatic paralysis, the prognosis for patients with UDP is usually excellent unless significant underlying pulmonary disease is present. Patients develop compensatory mechanisms, and those with phrenic injuries may recover fully or partially. At times, patients may spontaneously recover from idiopathic disease. Patients who do not recover from UDP generally lead relatively normal lives. In this group, dyspnea may develop with exertion, leading to increased ventilatory demands. The morbidity of UDP is mainly based on the underlying pulmonary functional status and the etiology of the paralysis. Because most cases of UDP are found incidentally during imaging studies, many patients have no symptoms. Diaphragmatic paralysis is more likely to affect the left hemidiaphragm. The patients with UDP who symptoms and decreased quality of life do have are those who have concurrent underlying lung diseases. Bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis The prognosis for patients with BDP depends on the nature of the underlying disease. These patients are usually symptomatic. When symptoms are severe or underlying lung pathology is present, patients may develop ventilatory failure without medical intervention. Some patients may recover diaphragmatic function if nerve injury is not permanent. Other patients, however, may require long-term treatment. If recovery occurs, it usually takes considerable time (>1 y). PREDEFINED QUESTION AND ANSWER ON Diaphragmatic paralysis Q1. What is diaphragmatic paralysis? A. Diaphragmatic paralysis is a condition where one or both sides of the diaphragm lose their ability to contract effectively, leading to impaired breathing. It can be unilateral (one side) or bilateral (both sides). Q2. What causes diaphragmatic paralysis? A.Common causes include: Injury or trauma to the phrenic nerve (e.g., during surgery or chest trauma) Neurological diseases affecting the diaphragm muscle or its nerve supply Infections, tumors, or inflammatory conditions Congenital abnormalities (rare) Idiopathic causes Q3. What are the symptoms of diaphragmatic paralysis? A. Unilateral paralysis: Often asymptomatic or mild symptoms such as shortness of breath on exertion or when lying down. Bilateral paralysis: More severe symptoms including difficulty breathing at rest, orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying flat), fatigue, disturbed sleep, recurrent pneumonia, and respiratory failure in severe cases. Q4. How is diaphragmatic paralysis diagnosed? A. Imaging studies such as chest X-ray, ultrasound, fluoroscopy, CT, or MRI can show elevated hemidiaphragm or reduced diaphragm movement. Pulmonary function tests show decreased lung volumes, especially when lying down. Electromyography (EMG) and phrenic nerve stimulation tests assess nerve and muscle function. Arterial blood gas analysis may show low oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels in advanced cases. Q5. What treatment options are available? A. Conservative management: Includes respiratory support, physical therapy, and monitoring if symptoms are mild. Mechanical ventilation: May be needed in severe bilateral paralysis. Surgical options: Diaphragm plication: Tightening the paralyzed diaphragm to improve lung expansion. Diaphragmatic pacing: Electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve if it is intact. Treatment choice depends on severity, underlying cause, and patient condition. Q6. What is the prognosis? A. Prognosis varies; unilateral paralysis often has a good outcome with minimal symptoms. Bilateral paralysis can be life-threatening without intervention but may improve with treatment. Recovery depends on the cause; nerve injury may recover over time, while muscle damage may be permanent. Q7. Can diaphragmatic paralysis be prevented? A. Prevention focuses on avoiding phrenic nerve injury during surgery or trauma. Early diagnosis and management of underlying conditions may reduce complications. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Diaphragmatic paralysis Doctor: Hello, I want to discuss the results of your recent tests. They show that you have diaphragmatic paralysis, which means one side of your diaphragm muscle is not moving properly. Patient: What causes this? How did it happen? Doctor: Diaphragmatic paralysis often happens because of injury or damage to the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm muscle. This can occur after surgery, trauma, infections, or sometimes from neurological conditions. In your case, it may be related to your previous injury/surgery. Patient: What symptoms should I expect? I’ve been feeling short of breath. Doctor: Yes, shortness of breath, especially when lying flat (called orthopnea), is common. You may also notice fatigue, chest discomfort, or difficulty with exercise. If both sides are affected, symptoms can be more severe and may lead to respiratory failure. Patient: How do you confirm this diagnosis? Doctor: We use several tests. Chest X-rays and ultrasound can show an elevated or immobile diaphragm. A special test called the sniff test under fluoroscopy or ultrasound shows diaphragm movement. The gold standard is electromyography (EMG) of the diaphragm and phrenic nerve. Patient: What treatments are available? Doctor: Treatment depends on severity. For mild cases, we monitor and support breathing. If symptoms are severe, we may recommend non-invasive ventilation at night to help you breathe better during sleep. If paralysis persists beyond 6 to 12 months and symptoms remain significant, surgery called diaphragm plication can be done to tighten the diaphragm and improve lung function. In some cases, phrenic nerve pacing may be an option. Patient: Can this get better on its own? Doctor: Sometimes, especially if caused by nerve injury, partial or full recovery can occur over months to a year or more. We will monitor your progress closely. Patient: What should I watch for? Doctor: Watch for worsening shortness of breath, especially when lying down, increased fatigue, or difficulty sleeping. If you develop any new symptoms, let us know promptly. Patient: Thank you for explaining. What’s the next step? Doctor: We’ll continue monitoring your breathing and may start you on nighttime ventilation if needed. We’ll also schedule follow-ups to assess recovery and discuss surgery if symptoms don’t improve. REFERENCES Diaphragmatic Paralysis Treatment & Management: Approach Considerations, Unilateral Diaphragmatic Paralysis, Bilateral Diaphragmatic Paralysis Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) Coughing up blood involves coughing or spitting up blood or bloody mucus from your lower respiratory tract (lungs and throat). Also called hemoptysis (pronounced “he-MOP-tih-sis”), coughing up blood is common and can have many causes. Most causes aren’t serious. However, you may need to visit an ER immediately if you’re coughing up large amounts of blood. Blood that you cough up often looks bubbly or frothy and is mixed with mucus or spit. It can appear pink, red or rust-colored and is usually in small amounts. Coughing up blood and vomiting blood Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) isn’t the same as vomiting blood (hematemesis). Blood that’s coughed up usually looks like blood-stained spit mixed with mucus. The blood comes from your throat or mouth. Vomiting blood involves spewing large quantities of blood. It usually involves internal bleeding in your upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. See a healthcare provider immediately if you’re vomiting blood. It can be. It all depends on what’s causing your blood loss and the extent of your blood loss. Most causes aren’t serious and are treatable. Still, coughing up blood can be a sign of serious conditions, like a severe infection or lung cancer. Losing too much blood at once can be life-threatening and require emergency medical attention. Only a healthcare provider can determine how serious your condition is. If you’re coughing up large quantities of blood, or if your condition doesn’t improve, see a provider. Possible Causes OF Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) Causes range from mild (most common) to serious and potentially life-threatening. Usually, coughing up blood is related to an infection. The most common causes include: Bronchitis. Pneumonia. Tuberculosis. Other causes include: Bronchiectasis. Cystic fibrosis. Vasculitis. Drug use (crack/cocaine). Complications from lupus. Congestive heart failure. Injury to the arteries in your lungs. Irritation from a bronchoscopy biopsy. Using blood thinners (anticoagulants). Excessive coughing that irritates your throat. Blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolism). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pulmonary aspiration (breathing blood into your lungs). Lung cancer (especially in people over 40 who smoke). Blood entering your throat from your nose (nosebleed), tonsils or teeth. Foreign body or obstruction in your airway (more common among children). Care and Treatment Your healthcare provider will review your medical history, perform a physical exam and ask questions to determine what’s causing you to cough up blood. They may ask: How much blood you’ve been coughing up. How often you’ve been coughing up blood. How long you’ve been coughing up blood. How much blood is mixed with mucus or spit. Your healthcare provider may also ask about behaviors that put you at risk, like drug use or smoking. They may try to identify potential causes by asking about other symptoms you’ve been experiencing. They may perform any of the following tests to diagnose the underlying cause: A chest X-ray to look for tumors or fluid in your lungs. A computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest to investigate findings from the X-ray or accompany an additional procedure, like a bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopy to check if your airways are clear and locate the site where the bleeding’s occurring. A complete blood count (CBC) to assess how much blood you’ve lost and look for signs of infection. A sputum culture of your lung excretions to look for infectious causes that may be causing you to cough up blood, like bacteria or viruses. A blood clotting test (coagulation test) to see if a bleeding disorder is related to your symptoms. Pulmonary arteriography to see how blood flows through your lungs. A urinalysis and/or kidney function test to rule out autoimmune conditions that affect your lungs and kidneys. Your provider may perform additional procedures or order other tests depending on what they suspect is causing you to cough up blood. How is coughing up blood treated? Treatment depends on how serious your blood loss is and what’s causing you to cough up blood. If you’re experiencing severe blood loss, you’ll receive care in the intensive care unit (ICU). Your care team will work to stabilize you and stop the bleeding before proceeding to diagnose what’s causing your blood loss. Treatments for severe blood loss related to coughing up blood may include: A bronchoscopy to remove clots in your airways that may be causing the bleeding. Bronchial artery angiography and embolization to stop blood flow in blood vessels that are causing your bleeding. Medicine that’s used to stop bleeding related to severe blood loss (tranexamic acid). Once they determine what’s causing you to cough up blood, your healthcare provider will discuss the best treatment plan to address your symptoms and underlying condition. Treatments to address conditions that may cause you to cough up blood include: Antibiotics: If pneumonia or tuberculosis is causing your condition. Steroids: If inflammation is causing your condition. Surgery and cancer treatment: If a malignant (cancerous) tumor is causing your condition. When To Call the Doctor Coughing up blood can be a sign of a serious medical condition. Seek emergency care if you’re coughing up large quantities of blood. If you\\'re coughing up small amounts of blood for longer than a week, make an appointment with a healthcare provider. They’ll determine what’s causing your hemoptysis and get you the necessary treatment. Seek immediate medical attention if you’re coughing up more than a few teaspoons of blood, if you’ve been coughing up blood longer than a week or if your cough is accompanied by other symptoms, including: Fever. Chest pain. Night sweats. Shortness of breath. Rapid or severe weight loss. Dizziness or light-headedness. Blood in your urine (hematuria) or stools. Differential Diagnosis (DDx) of Coughing Up Blood (Hemoptysis) in Pediatrics Common Causes: Lower respiratory tract infections: Pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, bronchitis are the most frequent causes. Foreign body aspiration: Causes mechanical trauma and inflammation leading to bleeding; often presents with coughing, wheezing, or choking history. Tracheostomy-related complications: In children with tracheostomy, local trauma or granulation tissue can cause bleeding. Bronchiectasis: Chronic airway inflammation and infection causing dilated bronchi and bleeding. Cystic fibrosis: Associated bronchiectasis and infection can cause hemoptysis. Congenital heart disease: Especially with pulmonary vascular obstruction or pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs): Abnormal blood vessel connections can rupture and bleed. Alveolar hemorrhage syndromes: Including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, Goodpasture syndrome, vasculitis (e.g., Wegener’s granulomatosis). Primary pulmonary hemosiderosis: Rare cause of recurrent alveolar bleeding. Neoplasms: Bronchial adenoma, metastatic tumors (rare in children). Trauma: Chest injury causing lung or airway bleeding. Tuberculosis: Especially in endemic areas, can cause hemoptysis. Parasitic infections: Such as echinococcosis (hydatid cyst). Idiopathic or cryptogenic hemoptysis: When no cause is found after thorough evaluation. Factitious hemoptysis: Self-inflicted or psychogenic bleeding, rare but important to consider. Epidemiology and Characteristics: Hemoptysis is rare in children under two years old presenting to emergency departments. When it occurs, it is often linked to injury or serious illness. In one study of children under two, all cases of hemoptysis were associated with significant coughing and respiratory infections. Children, especially those under six, tend to swallow sputum, so hemoptysis may go unnoticed unless bleeding is substantial. Differentiating hemoptysis from other sources of bleeding, such as hematemesis (vomiting blood), is crucial for diagnosis and treatment. Hemoptysis typically presents as bright red or rust-colored, frothy blood mixed with sputum and has an alkaline pH. Hematemesis is usually dark red or brown, may be mixed with food particles, is often preceded by vomiting, and has an acidic pH. Causes: The most common cause of hemoptysis in children is acute lower respiratory tract infection, accounting for about 40% of cases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) frequently causes hemoptysis, ranging from blood-tinged sputum to massive bleeding. Massive hemoptysis occurs in about 5% of CF patients, with mild hemoptysis in approximately 1% annually, more common in older patients . Other causes include: Bronchiectasis (non-CF related): 10-15% incidence of hemoptysis. Foreign body aspiration: A leading cause, especially in children under four. An abrupt onset of coughing in a healthy child can signal foreign body inhalation. Pulmonary hemorrhage: Extravasation of blood into airways or lung tissue, uncommon in children. Less common causes include primary pulmonary tuberculosis (less than 1% of cases), and in older children, vasculitis, bronchial tumors, and bronchiectasis PREDEFINED QUESTION AND ANSWERS ON Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) Q. What is hemoptysis in children? A. Hemoptysis is the expectoration of blood or blood-tinged sputum from the lower respiratory tract. It is rare in children and often not life-threatening but can be serious if massive. Q.What are the most common causes of pediatric hemoptysis? A. Infections: Lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and tracheobronchitis are the leading causes (~40%). Foreign body aspiration: Especially in children under 4 years, causing local trauma and inflammation. Cystic fibrosis (CF): Hemoptysis ranges from mild to massive; about 5% of CF patients experience massive hemoptysis. Bronchiectasis (non-CF related) and tracheostomy-related complications also contribute. Less common causes include tuberculosis, aberrant bronchial circulation, pulmonary hemorrhage, and tumors. Q. How is massive hemoptysis defined and managed? A. Massive hemoptysis is generally defined as expectoration of more than 8 mL/kg in 24 hours or more than 240 mL total blood loss. Management includes airway stabilization, selective lung intubation, mechanical ventilation with high PEEP to tamponade bleeding, and possibly bronchial artery embolization or surgery. Q. How is hemoptysis diagnosed in children? A. Diagnosis relies on: Detailed history and physical exam to identify cause and severity. Chest X-ray and CT scan to localize bleeding and identify underlying pathology. Bronchoscopy for direct visualization, diagnosis, and sometimes treatment. Laboratory tests including CBC, coagulation profile, and arterial blood gases. Q. What treatments are used for pediatric hemoptysis? A. Treat underlying infection with antibiotics or antivirals. Supportive care with oxygen and airway management. Bronchoscopic interventions for bleeding control (tamponade, vasoconstriction). Bronchial artery embolization or surgery if bleeding persists or is massive. Q. What should be considered in the differential diagnosis? A. Differentiate hemoptysis from hematemesis or bleeding from the upper airway or gastrointestinal tract. Consider non-respiratory causes such as bleeding disorders or vascular malformations DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) Doctor: Hello, I understand your child has been coughing up some blood. Can you tell me more about what you have noticed? Parent: Yes, over the last two days, my child has coughed up some red-tinged mucus a few times. It’s not a lot, but it’s definitely blood. Doctor: I see. Has your child had any recent illnesses, like a cold, cough, or fever? Parent: Yes, they had a bad cough and runny nose about a week ago, but it seemed to be getting better. Doctor: Has your child had any choking episodes or sudden coughing fits recently? Parent: Actually, a few days ago, they started coughing suddenly during dinner, but it stopped quickly. Doctor: That’s helpful to know. Sometimes, coughing up blood in children can be caused by infections or if something was inhaled into the lungs accidentally. Has your child ever been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis or any lung conditions? Parent: No, no known lung problems. Doctor: Okay. Has your child had any other symptoms like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or weight loss? Parent: No, none of those. Doctor: Good. We will do a physical exam and some tests, including a chest X-ray, to find out what’s causing the bleeding. Most of the time, it’s due to infections or irritation and can be treated effectively. If the bleeding gets worse or your child has trouble breathing, please bring them to the emergency room immediately. Parent: Thank you, doctor. I’m worried but glad you’re checking it out. Doctor: It’s understandable to be concerned. We’ll work together to find the cause and make sure your child gets the right treatment. REFERENCES Coughing Up Blood: Causes and When To Seek Care HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a rare heart condition that a child is born with. That means it\\'s a congenital heart defect. In this condition, the left side of the heart doesn\\'t develop fully and is too small. So it can\\'t pump blood well. Instead, the right side of the heart must pump blood to the lungs and to the rest of the body. Treatment for hypoplastic left heart syndrome may include medicines, heart surgery or a heart transplant. Advances in care have improved the outlook for babies born with HLHS. CAUSES OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) happens in the womb when a baby\\'s heart develops. The cause isn\\'t known. Gene changes may play a role. In hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the left side of the heart hasn\\'t grown enough so it does not develop fully. It can\\'t properly send blood to the body. In HLHS, the following areas of the heart are too small: The lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. The body\\'s main artery, called the aorta. The heart valves on the left side of the heart, called the aortic and mitral valves. After birth, the right side of a baby\\'s heart usually pumps blood both to the lungs and to the rest of the body. The blood passes through an opening called the ductus arteriosus. This opening, also called a vessel, connects the pulmonary artery directly to the aorta. The oxygen-rich blood goes back to the right side of the heart through a natural opening between the upper chambers of the heart. The opening is called the foramen ovale. The ductus arteriosus usually closes after the first day or two of life. When that happens, the right side of the heart has no way to pump blood to the body. The left side of the heart takes over this job. But in babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the left side can\\'t pump blood well. So they need medicine to keep these connections open and keep blood flowing to the body until they have heart surgery. Risk factors OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME People who have a child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) have a higher risk of having another baby with this or a similar condition. There is no other clear risk factors for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Symptoms OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME Babies born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) usually are very sick soon after birth. Symptoms of HLHS include: Blue or gray skin, lips or fingernails. Depending on skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see. Rapid, difficult breathing. Poor feeding. Cold hands and feet. Weak pulse. Being more drowsy or less active than is typical for most babies. Without treatment, a baby with this condition may go into shock. Symptoms of shock include: Cool, clammy skin that can be pale or lips that can be blue or gray. A weak and rapid pulse. Breathing that may be slow and shallow or very rapid. Dull eyes that seem to stare. When to see a doctor Get emergency medical help if your baby has: Changes in skin or nail color. Trouble breathing or fast breathing. Weak pulse or rapid pulse. Cool clammy skin. Diagnosis OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME To diagnose hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a healthcare professional examines the baby and listens to the baby\\'s heart. The healthcare professional may hear a sound called a heart murmur. Rushing blood flow causes this sound. Tests Tests used to find hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) in the baby before or after birth may include: Pregnancy ultrasound. A routine ultrasound exam during the second trimester of pregnancy usually can tell if the baby has HLHS. Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to make pictures of the heart. It shows how blood flows through the heart. It can be used after a baby is born to diagnose hypoplastic left heart syndrome. If a baby has HLHS, the test might find that the lower left heart chamber and heart valves are small. The body\\'s main artery, called the aorta, also may be small. Treatment OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME A baby born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) needs urgent treatment. Treatment can include many surgeries or a heart transplant. Medicines and other therapies are used to manage symptoms before heart surgery. Talk with your child\\'s healthcare professional about treatment options for your child. If hypoplastic left heart syndrome is found before birth, healthcare professionals usually recommend giving birth at a hospital with a cardiac surgery center. Medications The medicine alprostadil (Prostin VR Pediatric) is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open. It typically closes in all babies soon after birth. But in babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the ductus needs to stay open so that blood can go to the rest of the body. Therapies While waiting for surgery or a heart transplant, a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome may be given medicine and have these treatments: Breathing help. Babies who have trouble breathing may need help from a breathing machine called a ventilator. Fluids through a vein. A baby might receive fluids through a tube inserted into a vein. These are called intravenous (IV) fluids. Feeding tube. Babies who have trouble feeding or who tire while feeding can be fed through a feeding tube. Surgery or other procedures Most children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome need several surgeries. Atrial septostomy. This treatment uses tubes called catheters and a balloon to make or widen an opening between the heart\\'s upper chambers. It lets more blood flow between the upper two chambers of the heart. This treatment is done if the foramen ovale closes or is too small. Babies born with a hole in the heart, called an atrial septal defect, might not need atrial septostomy. Other surgeries can make separate pathways to get the correct blood flow to the body and lungs. The surgeries are done in three stages. Norwood procedure. This surgery is often done within the first two weeks of life. There are various ways to do this treatment. Surgeons rebuild the aorta and connect it to the heart\\'s lower right chamber. Then they add a tube called a shunt to provide the lungs with blood. The surgeons may use one of two types of tubes. One type of tube connects the body\\'s main artery to the arteries leading to the lungs. Those are the pulmonary arteries. The other type of tube goes from the right lower heart chamber to the pulmonary arteries. This treatment lets the right lower heart chamber pump blood to both the lungs and the body. Sometimes, a mixed, also called hybrid, procedure is done. Heart surgeons place a stent in the ductus arteriosus to maintain the opening between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Then they place bands around the pulmonary arteries to reduce blood flow to the lungs. They also make an opening between the upper chambers of the heart. After the Norwood procedure, a baby\\'s skin often is still slightly still slightly blue or gray. This is because oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood continue to mix within the heart. The blue or gray color may be easier or harder to see in some babies. Once a baby has this treatment, the odds of survival can go up. Bidirectional Glenn procedure. This tends to be the second surgery. It\\'s usually done when a child is between 4 and 6 months of age. It involves removing the first shunt and connecting the large vein that drains blood from the head and arms to the pulmonary artery. Now the lungs receive blood from the vein instead of the shunt. The large vein is called the superior vena cava. This surgery lessens the work of the right lower heart chamber by letting it pump blood mainly to the aorta. It also lets most of the oxygen-poor blood returning from the body flow directly into the lungs. After this treatment, all the blood returning from the upper body flows to the lungs. So blood with more oxygen is pumped to the aorta to supply organs and tissues throughout the body. Fontan procedure. This surgery usually is done when a child is between 3 and 4 years of age. The surgeon creates a path for the blood from the lower legs to flow directly into the pulmonary arteries. The vessel involved is called the inferior vena cava. The pulmonary arteries then send the blood into the lungs. The Fontan procedure lets the rest of the oxygen-poor blood returning from the body flow to the lungs. After this surgery, there\\'s little mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood in the heart. So the skin should no longer look blue or gray. Heart transplant. Many babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome need a heart transplant. (8) Children who have heart transplants need to take medicines for life to so that their bodies don\\'t reject the donor heart. Follow-up care After surgery or a transplant, a baby needs lifelong care with a heart doctor trained in congenital heart disease to watch for complications. Your child may need further treatment or other medicines for these complications. Some children may need to take antibiotics before certain dental or other procedures to help prevent infections. Ask your child\\'s healthcare professional if your child needs preventive antibiotics. Some children also may need to limit physical activity. Follow-up care for adults Adults who were born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) need to see a heart doctor trained in congenital heart disease in adults. Recent advances in surgical care have helped children with HLHS grow into adulthood. So it\\'s not yet clear what challenges an adult with the heart condition might have. Adults need regular, lifelong follow-up care to watch for changes in the condition. People thinking about becoming pregnant should talk with their healthcare professionals about pregnancy risks and birth control options. Having hypoplastic left heart syndrome raises the risk of: Heart and blood vessel problems during pregnancy. Miscarriage. A baby being born with a congenital heart defect. Complications OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME With proper treatment, many babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) survive. But they do need many surgeries and can have less energy and other challenges. Complications of HLHS may include: Getting tired more easily during sports or other exercises. Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. Fluid buildup, called edema, in the lungs, stomach area, legs and feet. Not growing well. Developmental conditions related to the brain and nervous system. Need for more heart surgery or a heart transplant. Prevention OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME There\\'s no way to prevent hypoplastic left heart syndrome. If you were born with a heart condition, talk with a heart doctor and genetic counselor before getting pregnant. Outlook / Prognosis OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME After treatment for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, your child will need lifelong follow-up visits at least once a year with a cardiologist (heart doctor). These visits ensure that their heart, lungs and other organs continue to work properly. When your child becomes an adult, they’ll transition to care with a specialist in adult congenital heart disease. Most children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome will need heart medications. They’ll also need to take antibiotics before any other surgeries, including dental surgeries. These medications reduce the risk of endocarditis (a heart infection). Outlook for hypoplastic left heart syndrome Without treatment, hypoplastic left heart syndrome is fatal days or weeks after birth. With treatment, the prognosis depends on the complexity of your child’s heart deformity. Ask your baby’s healthcare provider about the risks associated with each surgery. Some children may have decreased physical endurance for the rest of their lives. Usually, healthcare providers recommend limiting intensive physical activities, such as competitive sports. Survival rate of hypoplastic left heart syndrome About 20% to 60% of babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome survive their first year of life. After that, the survival rate for the next five, 10 and 15 years is about 40%. Babies who have a normal birth weight and aren’t born prematurely do better than babies with lower birth weights. One study found that most babies who survived their first year were still alive at age 18. Prevention Many HLHS cases don’t have an obvious cause. However, providers always encourage healthful habits during pregnancy, including: Avoiding alcohol and smoking. Managing any medical conditions, such as diabetes. Eating a healthy diet. Taking a daily prenatal vitamin with at least 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid. If you or your partner has hypoplastic left heart syndrome in their family, you may want to talk with a genetic counselor before getting pregnant. Living With HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME Children born with this condition can live a healthy life with long-term monitoring from a cardiologist. You can care for your child in these ways: Make sure your child gets vaccinated against the flu every year and against COVID-19. Bring your child to cardiologist appointments every six months or every year. Make sure your child takes their medications. Limit your child’s intense physical activity based on their provider’s recommendations. Work with them if they have learning difficulties. COMMON QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME Q. What are the risks of surgery? A. The initial surgery (Norwood procedure) carries the highest risk, with mortality rates around 20-25%, though some centers report better outcomes. Risks include complications such as aortic arch obstruction, heart rhythm problems, and organ dysfunction. Later surgeries (Glenn and Fontan procedures) have progressively lower risks but still carry potential complications. Q. Are there potential surgery complications to watch for? A. Yes. Complications can include heart failure, arrhythmias, thrombosis, infections, stroke, nerve damage, and issues related to the shunts or conduits placed during surgery. Long-term risks include heart rhythm abnormalities, protein-losing enteropathy, and decreased exercise tolerance. Q. What medications does my child need? A. Most children require lifelong heart medications, including those to support heart function and prevent infections. Antibiotics are often needed before surgeries or dental work to reduce the risk of endocarditis (heart infection). Q. Are there any medication side effects? A. Side effects vary depending on the medications but may include impacts on kidney or liver function, blood clotting, or immune system effects. Your healthcare provider will monitor for side effects closely during follow-up visits. Q. How will HLHS affect my child’s life? A. Children with HLHS often have reduced physical endurance and may need to limit strenuous activities. They may experience developmental delays and require ongoing medical care. Lifelong cardiology follow-up is essential. Some may eventually need a heart transplant. Q. What follow-up care does my child need after surgery? A. Lifelong follow-up with a cardiologist specializing in congenital heart disease is necessary, at least annually. Monitoring includes heart function, growth, development, and screening for complications. Transition to adult congenital heart disease specialists occurs as the child matures. Q. If I have another baby, does that child have a higher risk of HLHS? A. HLHS is a congenital condition with some genetic and environmental risk factors. While the exact recurrence risk varies, having one child with HLHS slightly increases the risk for subsequent children. Genetic counseling can provide personalized risk assessment DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME Several diseases or conditions can mimic the presentation of HLHS, particularly in neonates with cyanosis, signs of poor perfusion, or congestive heart failure. Accurate differentiation is critical, as management strategies for these conditions differ significantly from HLHS. Below is a discussion of diseases or conditions that can be mistaken for HLHS: Critical aortic stenosis Severe aortic stenosis can cause LV hypertrophy and poor systemic perfusion, resembling HLHS. However, the LV is typically present in critical aortic stenosis and may be dilated rather than hypoplastic. Echocardiography can differentiate this condition by visualizing the LV size and function and assessing the degree of aortic valve obstruction. Coarctation of the aorta Coarctation of the aorta, especially with a large ventricular septal defect, can lead to cyanosis and shock as the ductus arteriosus begins to close. Because of systemic hypoperfusion, this condition may be confused with HLHS, but echocardiography will show a normally sized or hypertrophied LV and an obstruction localized to the aortic isthmus. Shone complex Shone complex is a rare congenital heart condition characterized by multiple levels of left-sided obstructive lesions, including a supravalvular mitral membrane, a parachute mitral valve with all chordae attached to a single papillary muscle, subaortic stenosis caused by a fibromuscular ridge below the aortic valve, and coarctation of the aorta impairing systemic blood flow. This condition may be mistaken for HLHS because both conditions involve reduced left-sided cardiac output and systemic hypoperfusion. Symptoms such as cyanosis, poor perfusion, and heart failure, as the ductus arteriosus closes, are common to both, but echocardiography can differentiate them by identifying the discrete levels of obstruction in the Shone complex versus the global underdevelopment of the left heart in HLHS. Interrupted aortic arch This condition can present with systemic hypoperfusion and shock, similar to HLHS. This condition involves complete discontinuity of the aortic arch, but echocardiography or advanced imaging will reveal a normal or mildly hypoplastic LV and the specific site of aortic interruption.[8] Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) In TAPVR with obstruction, neonates may present with cyanosis and signs of low cardiac output that mimic HLHS. However, TAPVR is characterized by abnormal pulmonary venous drainage into the RA or systemic veins, which can be identified on echocardiography. The left-sided structures are typically normal in size and morphology. Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS) PA/IVS may resemble HLHS due to ductal-dependent systemic perfusion and cyanosis. However, in PA/IVS, the LV is usually normal in size, and the obstruction is at the pulmonary valve rather than the aortic or mitral valves. Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve Severe forms of Ebstein anomaly can cause cyanosis and right-sided heart failure, potentially mimicking HLHS. However, echocardiography will show significant apical displacement of the tricuspid valve with atrialization of the RV, distinguishing this condition from HLHS. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME HLHS is a rare congenital heart defect, accounting for approximately 2% to 3% of all congenital heart defects and about 6% to 9% of critical congenital heart disease requiring surgery or catheter-based intervention in the neonatal period. The incidence of HLHS is estimated to be 0.16 to 0.36 per 1000 live births and accounts for 1.4% to 3.8% of all congenital heart defects. Males are affected more frequently than females, with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 1.5:1. HLHS is responsible for 23% of cardiac deaths during the first week of life, highlighting its significant contribution to early neonatal mortality. Several study results have suggested a multifactorial etiology involving genetic and environmental factors. Although most cases of HLHS are sporadic, up to 20% may occur in association with chromosomal abnormalities or syndromes, such as Turner syndrome, trisomy 13, or trisomy 18. Familial clustering has been observed, and mutations in genes like NOTCH1 and HAND1 have been implicated, suggesting a genetic predisposition in some cases. HLHS is often diagnosed prenatally through routine fetal ultrasonography, with advances in imaging techniques enabling earlier and more accurate detection. Early diagnosis has improved perinatal management and outcomes. Despite its rarity, HLHS remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality due to congenital heart disease if left untreated, underscoring the importance of early intervention and specialized care. Procedures OF HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME Cardiac catheterization (pre–Norwood procedure) Routine diagnostic catheterization is not necessary because 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography can provide the necessary anatomic and hemodynamic data. However, a focused catheterization may become necessary to resolve any echocardiographic discrepancies that may be deemed important in surgical management. If catheterization is performed, the features reflect the pathophysiology described above. Oxygen saturation data indicate moderate-to-severe systemic venous desaturation, with a step-up at the level of right atrium secondary to left to right shunt across the atrial septum. The oxygen saturations in the right ventricle, pulmonary artery and aorta are similar reflecting common mixing in the right atrium. Mild systemic arterial desaturation is usually present unless severe pulmonary edema is noted. The right atrial pressure is mildly elevated, and the left atrial pressure is moderate to severely elevated, unless a large atrial septal defect is present. The right ventricular and pulmonary arterial systolic pressures are at systemic level. If the ductus arteriosus is constricted, these pressures are higher than those in the aorta. Angiography, although not necessary in all cases, reveals hypoplasia of the mitral valve, left ventricle and aorta. The ascending aorta is perfused in a retrograde fashion and serves as a common coronary artery, supplying both the right and left coronary arteries. Perform interventional catheterization with blade/balloon atrial septostomy or static dilatation of the atrial septum to relieve pulmonary venous hypertension if blood flow from left atrium to right atrium is severely restricted at the atrial septum. Because of marked hypoplasia of the left atrium, conventional Rashkind balloon or Park blade atrial septostomy may not be possible. In such situations, static dilatation of the atrial septum may be performed. If the atrial septum is extremely thick with a markedly restrictive atrial septum, stent implantation to keep the atrial septum open may become necessary. When hybrid procedures are contemplated, stenting of the ductus, atrial septum, or both may become necessary. Cardiac catheterization (pre–bidirectional Glenn [stage II] procedure) Perform routine catheterization before the operation to obtain hemodynamic data and several important angiograms. Calculate pulmonary vascular resistance to ensure the patient\\'s suitability for the stage II procedure. Perform angiography in the right ventricle to show ventricular function and tricuspid regurgitation. Perform angiography in the transverse aortic arch near the shunt to show pulmonary artery size and distribution and to rule out recurrent aortic coarctation or significant aortopulmonary collateral vessels. If collateral vessels are found, they may be occluded with coils at the same catheterization. Pre-Fontan (stage III) procedure Routine catheterization before completing the operation is generally recommended. Measure pulmonary artery pressure and calculate pulmonary vascular resistance and perform right ventricular angiography. Delineate pulmonary artery anatomy by performing angiography at the superior vena cava–pulmonary artery anastomosis via an internal jugular approach. Recurrent coarctation of the aorta and significant collateral vessels are excluded again. Descending aortography and selective right and left subclavian artery angiography to identify any collateral vessels to lungs is recommended. Postcatheterization complications include hemorrhage, vascular disruption after balloon dilation, pain, nausea and vomiting, and arterial or venous obstruction from thrombosis or spasm but are rare. Catheter intervention In the neonate, obstruction at the level of the patent foramen ovale (atrial septum) may be treated with conventional Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy. However, because the left atrium is small, Rashkind septostomy may not be feasible. In addition, the septum may be too thick to be torn by balloon septostomy; therefore, Park blade septostomy may be necessary and should precede the Rashkind procedure. However, hypoplastic left atrium may preclude blade septostomy. Static dilatation of the atrial septum with a balloon angioplasty catheter may be used and may not only relieve the obstruction but also keep some restriction, such that no rapid fall in the pulmonary vascular resistance occurs. Static balloon dilatation is preferred by the senior author. In some patients, the atrial septum may be intact or have a tight patent foramen ovale that may not even allow passage of a catheter. In such situations, puncture of the atrial septum by a Brockenbrough technique or radiofrequency perforation of the atrial septum followed by static balloon atrial septal dilatation or, preferably, stent implantation may become necessary. If progressive cyanosis develops after a previous Blalock-Taussig shunt, and if the hypoxemia is due to a stenotic shunt, balloon dilatation may be used to improve oxygen saturation. However, if the patient is of sufficient size and age to undergo a bidirectional Glenn procedure, this procedure should be performed instead of balloon angioplasty of a narrowed Blalock-Taussig shunt. If severe aortic coarctation is present, particularly after Norwood procedure, balloon angioplasty may be useful in relieving aortic obstruction and may help achieve reduce right ventricular afterload. If significant branch pulmonary artery stenosis is present before a bidirectional Glenn or Fontan conversion or after a Fontan procedure, balloon angioplasty or placement of intravascular stents is recommended. Development of aortopulmonary collateral vessels has been increasingly observed in recent studies. Before the final Fontan conversion, occlusion of these vessels in the catheterization laboratory, usually by means of coil embolization, is recommended to reduce left ventricular volume overloading and, probably, the duration of chest tube drainage following surgery. Following completion of Fontan procedure, some patients may develop recurrent pleural effusion, liver dysfunction, plastic bronchitis or protein-losing enteropathy. In these patients, following exclusion of obstructive lesion in the Fontan circuit, puncture of the atrial septum by a Brockenbrough technique followed by static balloon atrial septal dilatation or stent implantation may be beneficial. Patients who have undergone a fenestrated Fontan operation or have a residual atrial defect, despite correction, may have significant right-to-left shunting causing severe hypoxemia. These residual atrial defects may be closed using transcatheter techniques. Here are some commonly used drug classes and their considerations in pediatric HLHS: Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) Purpose: Keeps the ductus arteriosus open, which is critical for blood flow to the body in newborns with HLHS until surgical repair can be performed. Side Effects: Apnea (temporary cessation of breathing) is a common side effect, especially in neonates, requiring careful monitoring. Diuretics (e.g., Loop diuretics like Furosemide, Thiazide diuretics) Purpose: Used to manage fluid balance and control volume status, which is important for improving cardiac function and alleviating symptoms of heart failure. Side Effects: Can include electrolyte imbalances (e.g., low potassium), dehydration, and kidney dysfunction. Inotropic Drugs (e.g., Milrinone, Dopamine, Dobutamine) Purpose: These medications strengthen the heart\\'s contractions and can help improve cardiac function, particularly in severely ill neonates with cardiogenic shock or to prevent post-operative low cardiac output syndrome. Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor (PDE3i), has shown benefits in improving heart failure symptoms and survival in infants with single ventricle physiology, often used as a bridge to transplant. Side Effects: Can include arrhythmias, changes in blood pressure, and in adults, chronic use of PDE3 inhibitors has been associated with increased mortality, though this class is commonly used in children. Digoxin Purpose: A cardiac glycoside that was historically used for heart failure and arrhythmias. While its use has decreased due to narrow therapeutic windows and drug interactions in adults, it is still occasionally used in pediatric patients with fewer comorbidities. Some retrospective studies suggest improved survival in infants with HLHS discharged on digoxin after the Norwood procedure. Side Effects: Requires close monitoring due to a narrow margin between therapeutic and toxic concentrations. Potential side effects include arrhythmias and gastrointestinal issues. Beta-Blockers (e.g., Carvedilol, Metoprolol) Purpose: Fundamental in adult heart failure treatment, but their efficacy in pediatric single ventricle heart failure, including HLHS, has been limited. Some studies have even shown worse outcomes with carvedilol in patients with a systemic right ventricle. Side Effects: Can include bradycardia (slow heart rate) and hypotension. ACE Inhibitors (e.g., Captopril, Enalapril) Purpose: Used to manage heart failure, though their specific efficacy in pediatric HLHS is not as well-established as in biventricular heart failure. Side Effects: Can include hypotension and kidney dysfunction. Antibiotics Purpose: Children with HLHS often need prophylactic antibiotics before surgeries or dental work to reduce the risk of endocarditis (heart infection). Side Effects: Vary depending on the specific antibiotic but can include gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, and antibiotic resistance with overuse. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME Q. What is Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)? A. HLHS is a congenital heart defect where the left side of the heart is underdeveloped and cannot pump blood effectively to the body. This includes a small or missing left ventricle, mitral valve, aortic valve, and aorta. Q. What are the signs and symptoms of HLHS in a baby? A. Common signs include: Fast or difficult breathing Blue or grayish skin and nails (cyanosis) Trouble feeding Low energy or lethargy Fewer wet diapers than normal. Q. How is HLHS diagnosed? A. HLHS can sometimes be detected before birth via prenatal ultrasound. After birth, diagnosis involves: Chest X-ray Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) Pulse oximetry to measure oxygen levels Blood tests. Q. How is HLHS treated? A. Treatment involves: Prostaglandin medication to keep the ductus arteriosus open, allowing blood flow to the body. A series of three staged surgeries: Norwood procedure (within the first two weeks of life) Glenn procedure (around 4-6 months) Fontan procedure (between 18 months and 3 years). Some babies may need feeding tubes or additional catheter procedures to improve blood flow. Q. What is the outlook for children with HLHS? A. Without surgery, HLHS is fatal. With staged surgical treatment, many children survive into childhood and beyond, though they require lifelong cardiac care and monitoring. Q. What follow-up care will my child need? A. Children with HLHS need lifelong follow-up with pediatric cardiologists experienced in congenital heart disease. This includes regular imaging, monitoring for complications, and managing growth and development. Q. Can HLHS be prevented? A. The exact cause is unknown, and there are no known ways to prevent HLHS. It may involve genetic and environmental factors. If I have one child with HLHS, is my next baby at higher risk? Having one child with HLHS slightly increases the risk for another child to have congenital heart defects. Genetic counseling is recommended for personalized risk assessment DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME Doctor: Hello, I understand your baby was diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. I want to explain what this means and what we can do to help. Parent: Yes, we’re still trying to understand it. What exactly is HLHS? Doctor: HLHS is a condition where the left side of the heart — including the left ventricle, mitral valve, aortic valve, and the ascending aorta — is very small or underdeveloped. Because of this, the heart cannot pump blood effectively to the body on its own. Your baby’s oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood in the right side of the heart and relies on a special blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus to supply blood to the body. Parent: Is this why the doctors started a medication right away? Doctor: Exactly. We give a medication called prostaglandin E1 to keep the ductus arteriosus open. This is critical because if it closes, blood flow to the body will stop, which can be life-threatening. Parent: What happens next? Is surgery needed? Doctor: Yes, HLHS requires a series of three surgeries staged over the first few years of life. The first, called the Norwood procedure, usually happens within the first two weeks after birth. This surgery reconstructs the heart’s pathways to improve blood flow. Later, the Glenn and Fontan procedures further help the heart work more efficiently. Parent: Will my child need other treatments? Doctor: Besides surgery, your baby will need close monitoring and medications to support heart function and prevent complications. Some babies also need special feeding support because they can tire easily during feeding. Parent: What is the outlook for children with HLHS? Doctor: With modern surgical techniques and care, many children survive and grow, but they will need lifelong follow-up with a cardiologist experienced in congenital heart disease. They may have some limitations in activity and require ongoing medical care. Parent: If we have another baby, is there a chance they could have HLHS too? Doctor: Having one child with HLHS slightly increases the chance of congenital heart defects in future children. We can refer you for genetic counseling to better understand the risks. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything. It’s a lot to take in, but I feel better knowing the plan. Doctor: I understand this is overwhelming. We’re here to support you and your baby every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions anytime.

The pleural space is the area between the layers of the tissue lining the lung and the chest cavity. In a person with parapneumonic pleural effusion, the fluid buildup is caused by pneumonia. Causes OF Parapneumonic pleural effusion Pneumonia, most commonly from bacteria, causes parapneumonic pleural effusion. Symptoms OF Parapneumonic pleural effusion Symptoms can include any of the following: Chest pain, usually a sharp pain that is worse with cough or deep breaths Cough with sputum Fever Rapid breathing Shortness of breath Exams and Tests OF Parapneumonic pleural effusion Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. Your provider will also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and tap (percuss) your chest and upper back. The following tests may help to confirm a diagnosis: Complete blood count (CBC) Chest CT scan Chest x-ray Thoracentesis (a sample of fluid is removed with a needle inserted between the ribs) Ultrasound of the chest and heart Treatment OF Parapneumonic pleural effusion Antibiotics are prescribed to treat the pneumonia. If the person has shortness of breath, thoracentesis might be used to drain the fluid. If better drainage of the fluid is needed due to more severe infection, a drain tube can be inserted. Outlook (Prognosis) This condition improves when the pneumonia improves. Possible Complications Complications may include: Lung damage Infection that turns into an abscess, called an empyema, which will need to be drained with a chest tube Collapsed lung (pneumothorax) after thoracentesis Scarring of the pleural space (lining of the lung) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have symptoms of pleural effusion. Contact your provider or go to the emergency room if shortness of breath or difficulty breathing occurs right after thoracentesis. Alternative Names Pleural effusion - pneumonia Epidemiology OF Parapneumonic pleural effusion US and international statistics Hospital discharge data indicate that in the United States, approximately 1.3 million patients are hospitalized with pneumonia every year. The prevalence of parapneumonic effusions is dependent, in part, on the organism involved. Overall, pleural effusions are seen in about 35-40% of patients with bacterial pneumonia or anaerobic pneumonia, with a prevalence approaching 60% in pneumococcal pneumonia. Complicated pleural effusions are more common with anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections. This results in an estimated 500,000-750,000 patients with parapneumonic effusions annually. No good estimates are available regarding how many of these patients proceed to complicated effusions or empyema, but in small series, approximately 5-10% have been found require drainage or a surgical procedure. A study of US hospitalization data found that in 1996, the national hospitalization rate for parapneumonic empyema–related diagnoses was 3.04 per 100,000; by 2008, it had increased to 5.98 per 100,000, and by 2016, it had increased to 11.1 per 100,000. The empyema hospitalizations had a high cost per case ($38,591) and required a prolonged stay (13.8 d). Over the study period, a downward trend in length of stay and a small reduction in associated mortality were not, possibly due to increasing use of innovative treatments (e.g., surgery or intrapleural enzymatic therapy). No good estimates are available on the international incidence of pneumonia. The World Health Organization (WHO) cited a figure of 4.2 million for cases involving death from lower respiratory tract infections in 2004. From this figure, it is possible to extrapolate the incidence of pleural effusions and empyema using a US estimate, but caution is advised because lack of treatment and delayed treatment in developing countries may skew the international incidence upward. Age-, sex-, and race-related demographics In a 2021 report from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), 60% of the hospitalizations related to pleural infections were found to occur in the 18- to 64-year-old age group. In the United Kingdom and Europe, this age group accounted for 40% of adult pleural infections. Advancing age leads to an increase in associated comorbidities, including a higher risk of pneumonia and, subsequently, pleural effusions and empyema. In the 2021 ACCP report, a male predominance in adult pleural infections was noted. Plausible hypotheses for this difference include the following: Gender differences in health-seeking behaviors, with a delayed presentation in males Worse dental hygiene trends Greater frequency of preexisting comorbidities in males No specific ethnic or racial predisposition is recognized for empyema; however, a larger number of ethnic minorities have limited financial resources, less access to healthcare, and more comorbidities, which, in turn, may increase their risk of pneumonia, pleural effusions, and empyema. Differential Diagnoses OF Parapneumonic pleural effusion Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Bacterial Pneumonia Boerhaave Syndrome Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) Fungal Pneumonia Hemothorax Lung Abscess Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Peritonitis and Abdominal Sepsis Pleural Effusion Pleurodynia Pneumococcal Infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae) Secondary Lung Tumors Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Tuberculosis (TB) Procedures OF Parapneumonic pleural effusion Thoracocentesis and evaluation of pleural fluid A diagnostic thoracentesis is recommended for pleural fluid sampling when the effusion is suspected to be parapneumonic in nature. With the routine bedside use of US guidance for localization, there is no minimum safe size of effusion that should deter the procedure if it is clinically indicated. This determination, however, should be made on the basis of the clinician\\'s skill level. Generally, pleural effusion greater than or equal to 10 mm thick on a lateral decubitus chest radiograph is considered safe.For large-volume pleural effusion, the procedure may also serve a therapeutic purpose in relieving the dyspnea related to the effusion. Right lateral decubitus chest radiograph shows free-flowing pleural effusion, which should be sampled with thoracentesis for pH determination, Gram stain, and culture. Assessment of gross appearance Pleural fluid may range in appearance from a clear yellow liquid to an opaque turbid fluid to grossly purulent thick, viscous, foul-smelling pus. Foul-smelling fluid indicates an anaerobic infection. Pleural fluid testing Studies used in the evaluation of pleural fluid include the following: Cell count and differential - Results generally are not diagnostic, but most transudates are associated with a white blood cell (WBC) count lower than 1000/µL; in contrast, elevated cell counts with neutrophil predominance are typically noted in the early inflammatory phase of complicated parapneumic effusions, PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Parapneumonic pleural effusion Q. What are parapneumonic effusions and empyema? A. Parapneumonic effusions are pleural fluid collections that occur as a complication of pneumonia. They range from simple, sterile fluid accumulation to infected fluid. Empyema is the presence of pus in the pleural space, representing an advanced, infected parapneumonic effusion. Q. How common are parapneumonic effusions and empyema in children with pneumonia? A. More than 40% of bacterial pneumonias develop parapneumonic effusions, and a smaller percentage progress to empyema . Empyema complicates about 0.6-3% of pediatric pneumonia hospitalizations . Q. What are the stages of parapneumonic effusion and empyema development? A. Exudative (Uncomplicated) Stage: Sterile, clear or slightly cloudy pleural fluid with normal glucose and pH. Usually resolves with antibiotics alone. Fibropurulent (Complicated) Stage: Bacterial invasion causes pus formation, loculations, low pleural fluid pH (<7.2), low glucose (<60 mg/dL), and high LDH (>1000 IU/L). Requires drainage in addition to antibiotics. Organizational Stage: Fibroblast proliferation forms thick pleural peel restricting lung expansion. Fluid is thick and acidic (pH <7.0), with very low glucose and high LDH. Surgical intervention may be necessary. Q. What symptoms suggest parapneumonic effusion or empyema in children? A. Fever and persistent or worsening cough Chest pain, often pleuritic Difficulty breathing or increased work of breathing Reduced breath sounds and dullness to percussion on the affected side Signs of systemic infection such as tachycardia and malaise Q. How is the diagnosis confirmed? A. Chest X-ray showing pleural fluid Ultrasound or CT scan to assess fluid characteristics and loculations Thoracentesis with pleural fluid analysis (cell count, Gram stain, culture, pH, glucose, LDH) to differentiate uncomplicated vs. complicated effusions or empyema Q. What is the treatment approach? A. Uncomplicated effusions: Antibiotics alone, often managed outpatient if respiratory status is stable. Complicated effusions and empyema: Require antibiotics plus drainage via chest tube thoracostomy. If drainage fails or loculations persist, options include intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Supportive care includes oxygen, pain management, and monitoring for complications. Q. What are the potential complications if untreated? A. Chronic empyema with thick pleural peel causing lung restriction Bronchopleural fistula Septicemia and systemic infection Permanent loss of lung function Q. What is the prognosis? A. With prompt antibiotic therapy and appropriate drainage, most children recover fully. Mortality is low but can reach 15-20% in severe cases or delayed treatment. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Parapneumonic pleural effusion Doctor: Hello, I understand your child has been diagnosed with a pleural effusion related to pneumonia. I want to explain what this means and how we will manage it. Parent: Yes, can you tell me what a pleural effusion is? Doctor: Certainly. A pleural effusion is when fluid collects in the space around the lungs, called the pleural space. When this happens as a complication of pneumonia, we call it a parapneumonic effusion. If the fluid becomes infected and turns into pus, that is called empyema. Parent: How serious is this? What symptoms should I watch for? Doctor: It can range from mild to more serious. Your child may have persistent fever, cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. If the fever continues despite antibiotics, or breathing worsens, it suggests the effusion may be complicated or empyema has developed. Parent: What tests will you do? Doctor: We will do a chest X-ray and an ultrasound to see how much fluid is present and whether it is thick or loculated. We may also take a sample of the fluid with a needle to check for infection. Parent: How is it treated? Doctor: For small, uncomplicated effusions, antibiotics alone may be enough. For larger or infected effusions, your child may need a chest tube to drain the fluid. Sometimes, if the fluid is thick or loculated, we use medications called fibrinolytics or perform a minimally invasive surgery called VATS to remove the infected material. Parent: Will my child recover fully? Doctor: Most children recover completely with appropriate treatment. We will monitor your child closely to ensure the infection clears and lung function returns to normal. Parent: Is this common? Doctor: Parapneumonic effusions and empyema are uncommon but increasing complications of pneumonia in children. Early diagnosis and treatment are important for the best outcome. Parent: Thank you, doctor. That helps me understand what to expect. Doctor: You’re welcome. Please contact us immediately if your child’s breathing worsens, fever persists, or if you have any concerns. REFERENCES Parapneumonic Pleural Effusions and Empyema Thoracis Workup: Laboratory Studies, Chest Radiography, Ultrasonography Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) Pectus carinatum is a condition in which your sternum (breastbone) sticks out more than usual. Some people call it “pigeon chest” or “keel chest” because of how it makes your chest look. It’s the opposite of pectus excavatum, in which your breastbone is depressed inward and gives your chest a sunken appearance. Types of pectus carinatum Healthcare providers recognize two main pectus carinatum types: Chondrogladiolar. This is the more common type. The main part of your breastbone (farther down) sticks out. Chondromanubrial. The upper part of your breastbone sticks out. Providers may also talk about whether the condition affects both sides of your chest (symmetric) and if your sternum rotates to one side. Type I is chondrogladiolar and affects both sides. Type II is chondromanubrial and affects both sides. Type III only affects one side and you can have a depression on the other side. Pectus carinatum affects about 1 in 1,000 people. But it may be even more common. Some estimate that 1 in 300 people have it. It’s more common in men than women. Although the condition is present at birth, people often notice it during their teen years. Symptoms and Causes OF Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) Most people with pectus carinatum have no symptoms. They may have some chest pain associated with certain activities and positions. Pectus carinatum isn’t dangerous and doesn’t impact life expectancy. What causes pectus carinatum? Researchers don’t know the exact cause of pectus carinatum. But they believe it’s a disorder of the cartilage that joins your ribs to your breastbone. Researchers haven’t found a genetic issue yet, but they may in the future. Up to 33% of people with pectus carinatum have a family history of a chest wall issue. Pectus carinatum has an association with: Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder. Noonan syndrome, a genetic disorder. Scoliosis, abnormal curvature of the spine. Asthma, a lung disease. Bronchitis, inflamed airways. Mitral valve prolapse, a floppy heart valve. Complications of pectus carinatum Complications of pectus carinatum may include: Self-esteem issues. Bad posture. Back pain. Diagnosis and Tests OF Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) A healthcare provider will take your medical history and perform a physical examination. They may also check to see if you have scoliosis. Then they’ll order tests if they need to. The main test for diagnosing pectus carinatum is a chest X-ray from the front and side. Other tests may include: Computed tomography (CT) scan, a type of X-ray. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, a type of imaging that doesn’t use X-rays. Management and Treatment OF Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) Bracing and surgery are the pectus carinatum treatment options for people who want correction. Bracing is a nonoperative intervention that’s generally more effective in children. It requires compliance with the use of a brace, which can be challenging for children. Pectus carinatum brace This works like the way braces work on teeth. You wear the brace around your chest under or on top of your clothes. The brace provides pressure from both the front and back to move the breastbone back to its usual position. You wear it for up to 24 hours a day, for a period of six months to years. You can remove it for showering, sports and other activities.A brace works best before a growth spurt because your chest wall is still flexible. Pectus carinatum surgery This involves a technique called the Ravitch procedure. A surgeon makes an incision (cut) in the mid-chest area to remove cartilage in the front of your chest. They make a small cut in the front of your sternum and depress your sternum to a normal position. The surgeon anchors it into position with various techniques including sutures, plates or a bar. A surgeon can use a minimally invasive surgery that’s similar to a Nuss procedure. They use a metal bar to depress your sternum. They leave the bar in for one or more years and remove it in a separate surgical procedure. Surgeons have modified these procedures in different ways, but they usually secure the breastbone in some way. Complications/side effects of the treatment Bracing treatment for pectus carinatum is very safe. A small number of people may have irritation or breakdown of the skin where the brace touches it. If this happens, you can stop using the brace at the first sign of any irritation. Then you can ask your provider to adjust the brace. The surgical repair of pectus carinatum, like other extensive surgeries, carries certain risks. Both the Ravitch and Nuss procedures are safe and effective. But complications can happen, including: Pneumothorax (collapsed lung). Bleeding. Pleural effusion (fluid around your lung). Pericarditis (inflammation around your heart). Infection. Breastbone supports moving out of place. Recurrence (return) of pectus carinatum. How long does it take to recover from this treatment? After surgery, you may be in the hospital for one to five days. You’ll have a follow-up appointment with your surgeon after a few weeks. Outlook / Prognosis OF Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) Pectus carinatum doesn’t adversely affect life expectancy. For most people, it’s primarily a cosmetic issue (although symptoms can occur). The outlook for people who have pectus carinatum is generally very good. People who wear a brace or have the surgery are usually very satisfied with the results and their appearance. Prevention OF Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) No. Until researchers can clearly identify what causes pectus carinatum, you can’t prevent it. Some of the possible causes involve the genes you inherit from your parents, which you can’t change. Living With Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) People who have pectus carinatum generally live a normal life and shouldn’t limit their activities unless they experience discomfort. When to see a doctor You should see a healthcare provider if your pectus carinatum is getting in the way of your daily life. And don’t neglect your mental health. If you’re self-conscious about your chest and it’s affecting your self-esteem, correction can be beneficial. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) Pectus Excavatum (sunken chest; opposite deformity with inward sternum) Jeune Syndrome (congenital dwarfism with small, bell-shaped chest and abnormal ribs) Poland Syndrome (unilateral chest wall muscle and rib underdevelopment, sometimes with limb anomalies) Congenital Rib Anomalies (extra, absent, fused, or malformed ribs) Sternal Cleft and Other Sternum Malformations (partial or complete sternal defects) Slipped Ribs Syndrome (rib cartilage displacement causing pain and deformity) Jarcho-Levin Syndrome (crab-like chest with multiple vertebral and rib anomalies) Scoliosis and Kyphosis (spinal deformities causing chest wall asymmetry) Connective Tissue Disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Noonan syndrome, associated with chest wall deformities) Trauma or Previous Chest Surgery (acquired chest wall deformities) Chest Wall Tumors or Infections (rare causes of localized protrusions or deformities) EPIDEMIOLOGY OF Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) The estimated incidence is approximately 1 per 2,500 live births, with some reports suggesting a prevalence ranging from 0.06% to 0.1% in the general population of children. Other studies using imaging suggest prevalence rates of 2-5% when including mild or asymmetrical cases detected by CT scans. It is more common in males, with a reported male-to-female ratio of about 4:1. The condition is most frequently diagnosed in mid-childhood to adolescence, often becoming more noticeable during the adolescent growth spurt. Racial distribution shows higher frequency in White populations, and it is less common among Black and Asian children. There is a family history of chest wall deformities in about 25% to 65% of cases, indicating a genetic predisposition. Pectus carinatum may be associated with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome and Noonan syndrome, as well as congenital heart disease. Studies in different regions show some variation: for example, higher proportions of chest wall deformities including pectus carinatum have been reported in Brazil and Argentina compared to other countries. The deformity is rarely present at birth but tends to develop or worsen with growth, especially during puberty. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) Q. What is pectus carinatum? A. Pectus carinatum, also called \"pigeon chest,\" is a chest wall deformity where the breastbone (sternum) protrudes outward. It is less common than pectus excavatum and often noticed during growth spurts in adolescence. It may cause cosmetic concerns, chest pain, and sometimes affect heart and lung function. It is often associated with scoliosis. Q. What causes pectus carinatum? A. The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to be due to abnormal growth of the rib cartilage. Up to one-third of patients have a family history of chest wall deformities, suggesting a genetic component. It can also be associated with connective tissue disorders. Q. How is pectus carinatum diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is primarily clinical through physical examination. Imaging such as chest X-rays may be done to assess the chest wall and check for associated scoliosis. Genetic testing may be considered if syndromic features are present. Q. What treatments are available for children with pectus carinatum? A. Bracing: A custom-fitted chest-wall brace applies steady pressure to reshape the sternum over time, similar to orthodontic braces. It is most effective in children and teenagers with flexible chest walls and requires wearing the brace 14–23 hours per day for several months to a year. Surgery: For severe cases or when bracing fails, surgery such as the Ravitch procedure is performed. This involves removing abnormal cartilage and repositioning the sternum, often with a temporary implanted bar to hold the chest in place for 1–2 years. Q. What is recovery like after surgery? A. Children typically stay in the hospital 3–5 days post-surgery. Pain management is important during recovery, which usually takes 1–2 months. Activity restrictions apply initially to allow healing. The implanted bar is removed in a later procedure. Q. Does pectus carinatum affect life expectancy or cause serious health problems? A. Pectus carinatum is generally not dangerous and does not affect life expectancy. Most children have no or mild symptoms. However, it can cause chest pain and psychological distress due to appearance. Treatment can improve symptoms and self-esteem. Q. When should treatment be started? A. Bracing works best during childhood or early adolescence when the chest wall is still flexible. Doctors often recommend starting treatment after age 10. Surgery is reserved for more severe deformities or when bracing is ineffective. Q. Can pectus carinatum improve without treatment? A. No, the deformity does not typically resolve on its own and may worsen during growth spurts. Treatment is needed to correct or improve the chest shape DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Pectus carinatum(PIGEON CHEST) Doctor: Hello! I understand you’re here because you noticed your child’s chest is protruding more than usual. Can you tell me when you first noticed this? Parent: Yes, it started becoming more obvious over the last year, especially during their growth spurt. The chest kind of sticks out like a bird’s chest, and we’re worried. Doctor: What you’re describing sounds like pectus carinatum, sometimes called \"pigeon chest.\" It’s a condition where the breastbone and ribs push outward due to overgrowth of the cartilage. Parent: Is this dangerous? Will it affect my child’s health? Doctor: In most cases, pectus carinatum doesn’t cause serious health problems. Some children may have mild chest discomfort or breathing difficulties, but often the main concern is cosmetic. It’s also sometimes associated with conditions like scoliosis or connective tissue disorders, so we’ll check for those. Parent: How do you diagnose it? Doctor: Usually, we can diagnose it by physical exam. We may take a chest X-ray to see the structure better and check for any spine curvature. If needed, we can also assess lung and heart function. Parent: What treatment options are there? Doctor: For children and teens with flexible chest walls, bracing is the first treatment choice. A custom brace applies gentle pressure to reshape the chest over several months to a year. It needs to be worn consistently, often 14 to 23 hours a day. Parent: What if the brace doesn’t work? Doctor: If bracing isn’t effective or the deformity is severe, surgery might be recommended. The most common surgery is the Ravitch procedure, which involves removing abnormal cartilage and repositioning the sternum. Recovery usually takes a few weeks to months. Parent: Will my child need to limit activities? Doctor: During bracing, children can usually continue normal activities. After surgery, there will be some activity restrictions initially, but most children return to full activity after healing. Parent: Does the condition get worse over time? Doctor: It often becomes more noticeable during growth spurts but tends to stabilize once growth is complete. Early treatment during childhood or adolescence gives the best chance for correction. Parent: Thank you, doctor. This helps me understand what to expect and what we can do. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’ll work together to develop the best plan for your child and support you throughout treatment. Feel free to reach out with any questions.

That means it\\'s a congenital heart defect. In this condition, one large blood vessel leads out of the heart, instead of two. Having only one large blood vessel means that oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich blood mix. This mixing reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to the body. It usually increases the amount of blood flow into the lungs too. The heart has to work harder to adjust for the changes in blood flow. A baby, also called a fetus, with truncus arteriosus also usually has a hole between the two lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. The hole is called a ventricular septal defect. Another name for truncus arteriosus is common arterial trunk. Causes OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Truncus arteriosus occurs as a baby\\'s heart forms during pregnancy. There\\'s often no clear cause. Genetics and environmental factors may play a role. How the heart works To understand more about truncus arteriosus, it may be helpful to know how the heart typically works. The typical heart has four chambers. They are: The right upper chamber, also called the right atrium. This heart chamber receives oxygen-poor blood from the body. The right lower chamber, also called the right ventricle. This heart chamber pumps blood into the lungs through a large vessel called the pulmonary artery. The blood flows through the pulmonary artery into smaller vessels in the lungs where blood picks up oxygen. The left upper chamber, also called the left atrium. This heart chamber receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through vessels called pulmonary veins. The left lower chamber, also called the left ventricle. This chamber pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the body through the body\\'s largest blood vessel, called the aorta. A baby\\'s heart before birth The way the unborn baby\\'s heart forms during pregnancy is complex. At some point, there is a single large blood vessel leading out of the heart. The vessel is called the truncus arteriosus. It usually splits in two as the unborn baby grows in the womb. One part becomes the lower end of the body\\'s main artery, called the aorta. The other part becomes the lower part of the pulmonary artery. But in some babies, the truncus arteriosus never splits. The wall separating the two lower heart chambers hasn\\'t closed all the way. This results in a large hole between those chambers, called a ventricular septal defect. Babies with truncus arteriosus also often have a problem with the heart valve that controls blood flow from the lower heart chambers to the single vessel. This valve may not close all the way when the heart relaxes. Blood can move the wrong way, back into the heart. This is called truncal valve regurgitation. Risk factors OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS The exact cause of truncus arteriosus is unknown. But some things might increase the risk of a heart problem at birth. Risk factors include: Viral illness during pregnancy. Some infections can hurt a developing baby. For example, having German measles during pregnancy can cause changes in a baby\\'s heart development. German measles also is called rubella. Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy. Careful control of your blood sugar before and during pregnancy can reduce the risk of heart problems in your baby. If you have diabetes, work with your healthcare professional to be sure blood sugar is well controlled before getting pregnant. Some medicines taken during pregnancy. Some medicines can cause heart problems and other health conditions in a baby. Tell your healthcare professional about all the medicines you take, including those bought without a prescription. Some chromosomal disorders. An extra or irregular chromosome increases the risk of truncus arteriosus. Examples are DiGeorge syndrome, also called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and velocardiofacial syndrome. Smoking during pregnancy. If you smoke, quit. Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of heart conditions in your baby. Alcohol use. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy increases the risk of heart conditions and other health issues in a baby. Obesity. Obesity increases the risk of giving birth to a baby with a heart condition. Symptoms OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Symptoms of truncus arteriosus most often occur in the first few days of life. They include: Blue or gray skin due to low oxygen levels. Extreme sleepiness. Poor feeding. Poor growth. Pounding heartbeat. Fast breathing. Shortness of breath. When to see a doctor If you are worried about your baby\\'s feedings, sleep patterns or growth, contact a healthcare professional for an appointment. Always seek emergency medical care if a baby has any of the following: Blue or gray skin. Fast breathing. Shallow breathing. Any breathing trouble. Diagnosis OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Truncus arteriosus is usually diagnosed soon after a child is born. The baby may look blue or gray and have trouble breathing. When a baby is born, a healthcare professional always listens to the baby\\'s lungs to check breathing. If a baby has truncus arteriosus, the healthcare professional may hear fluid in the lungs during this exam. The healthcare professional also listens to the baby\\'s heart to check for irregular heartbeats or a whooshing sound, called a murmur. Tests Tests to diagnose truncus arteriosus include: Pulse oximetry. A sensor placed on the fingertip records the amount of oxygen in the blood. Too little oxygen may be a sign of a heart or lung problem. Chest X-ray. This test shows the condition of the heart and lungs. It can show the size of the heart. A chest X-ray also can tell if the lungs have extra fluid. Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create pictures of the beating heart. This is the main test to diagnose truncus arteriosus. It shows blood flow through the heart and heart valves. In a baby with truncus arteriosus, the test shows one single large vessel leading from the heart. There\\'s typically a hole in the wall between the lower heart chambers. Treatment OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Infants with truncus arteriosus need surgery to improve blood flow and oxygen levels. Many procedures or surgeries might be needed, especially as a child grows. Medicines might be given before surgery to help improve heart health. Children and adults with surgically repaired truncus arteriosus need regular health checkups for life. Medications Some of the medicines that might be given before truncus arteriosus surgery include: Water pills. Also called diuretics, these medicines help the kidneys remove extra fluid from the body. Fluid buildup is a common symptom of heart failure. Positive inotropes. These medicines help the heart pump stronger, which improves blood flow. They also help control blood pressure. Positive inotropes may be given by IV to treat severe heart failure symptoms. Surgery or other procedures Most infants with truncus arteriosus have surgery within the first few weeks after birth. The specific type of surgery depends on the baby\\'s condition. Usually, the baby\\'s surgeon: Rebuilds the single large vessel and aorta to create a new, complete aorta. Separates the upper part of the pulmonary artery from the single large vessel. Uses a patch to close the hole between the two lower heart chambers. Places a tube and valve to connect the right lower heart chamber with the upper pulmonary artery. This creates a new, complete pulmonary artery. The tube used to create the new pulmonary artery doesn\\'t grow with a child. Follow-up surgeries are needed to replace the tube as the child grows. Future surgeries may be done with a flexible tube called a catheter. This avoids the need for open-heart surgery. The healthcare professional inserts the catheter into a blood vessel in the groin and guides it to the heart. A new valve can be delivered through the catheter to the proper area. Sometimes a small balloon at the tip of the catheter is inflated at the site of a blockage, making a blocked artery wider. This procedure is called balloon angioplasty. After surgery for truncus arteriosus, a person needs lifelong follow-up care with a heart doctor specializing in congenital disease. This type of healthcare professional is called a congenital cardiologist. Lifestyle and home remedies OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS If you or your child had truncus arteriosus, your healthcare professional may recommend taking a few steps to protect the heart. Exercise limits. Some people with heart conditions need to limit exercise and sports activities, especially competitive sports. Ask your healthcare professional which sports and types of exercise are safe for you or your child. People with Eisenmenger syndrome should avoid strenuous physical activity. Antibiotics. Sometimes, heart conditions can increase the risk of infection in the lining of the heart or heart valves. This infection is called infective endocarditis. Antibiotics may be recommended to prevent infections before dental procedures and other surgeries. It\\'s also important to have good oral hygiene and regular dental checkups Pregnancy. If you\\'ve had truncus arteriosus repair surgery and want to become pregnant, talk to your healthcare professional first. Ask about the possible risks and complications. It\\'s best to be checked by healthcare professionals with training in adult congenital heart disease and high-risk pregnancies. Together, you and your care team can discuss and plan for any special care needed during pregnancy. Depending on the level of lung damage that occurred before truncus arteriosus surgery, pregnancy might or might not be recommended. Pregnancy is considered very high risk for those with Eisenmenger syndrome and is not recommended. Complications OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Truncus arteriosus causes severe problems with how blood flows through the lungs, heart and rest of the body. Complications of truncus arteriosus in babies include: Breathing problems. Extra fluid and blood in the lungs can make it difficult to breathe. High blood pressure in the lungs, also called pulmonary hypertension. This condition causes the blood vessels in the lungs to narrow. It becomes hard for the heart to pump blood into the lungs. Enlargement of the heart. Pulmonary hypertension and increased blood flow strain the heart. The heart must work harder to pump blood. This causes the heart muscle to grow larger. The enlarged heart gradually weakens. Heart failure. In this condition, the heart cannot supply the body with enough blood. Too little oxygen and too much strain on the heart can lead to heart failure. Infants who had their hearts successfully fixed with surgery may still have complications later in life. Possible complications are: Pulmonary hypertension that gets worse. Backward flow of blood through a heart valve, called regurgitation. Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. Common symptoms of these complications include: Dizziness. Feeling very fast, fluttering heartbeats. Feeling very tired. Shortness of breath when exercising. Swelling of the belly, legs or feet. Truncus arteriosus in adults In rare cases, some people born with truncus arteriosus can survive without heart surgery. They may live into adulthood. But those with the condition will almost certainly have heart failure and develop a complication called Eisenmenger syndrome. This syndrome is caused by permanent lung vessel damage. It results in a significant lack of blood flow to the lungs. Prevention OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Because the cause is unclear, it may not be possible to prevent truncus arteriosus. Getting good prenatal care is important. If you or someone in your family had a heart condition present at birth, talk to your healthcare professional before getting pregnant. You might need to see a genetic counselor and a heart doctor, called a cardiologist. If you decide to get pregnant, taking these steps can help keep your baby healthy: Get recommended vaccinations. Some infections can be harmful to a developing baby. For example, having German measles — also called rubella —during pregnancy can cause changes in a baby\\'s heart development. A blood test done before pregnancy can show if you\\'re immune to rubella. A vaccine is available for those who aren\\'t immune. Talk to your healthcare professional about your medicines. Check with your healthcare professional before taking any medicines if you\\'re pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant. Many drugs aren\\'t recommended for use during pregnancy because they can harm a developing baby. Take a folic acid supplement. Take a multivitamin with folic acid. Taking 400 micrograms of folic acid daily has been shown to reduce brain and spinal cord conditions in babies. It may help reduce the risk of heart conditions present at birth too. Control diabetes. If you have diabetes, ask your healthcare professional how to best manage the disease during pregnancy. Outlook / Prognosis OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Can a baby survive with truncus arteriosus? Yes, but they need surgical repair to survive. The survival rate for truncus arteriosus surgery is 80% to 97%, according to the latest research. Survival depends on many factors, including the complexity of a baby’s heart anatomy. About 75% of babies who have surgical repair are alive 20 years later. Most deaths occur within one year of repair. About 92.5% of babies who survive to one year after surgery are alive at 20 years. Your child’s care team can tell you more about the factors that might affect your child’s life expectancy. Can you live a normal life with truncus arteriosus? There’s limited research on how truncus arteriosus (after surgical repair) affects a person’s quality of life. One study showed children have reduced exercise tolerance and a lower health-related quality of life compared to their peers. Another study showed adults have reduced physical functioning but a similar quality of life as their peers overall. What it means to have a “normal life” can vary from person to person. Quality of life is a subjective experience. It’s important to talk to your child about how they’re feeling — physically and emotionally. As they get older, encourage them to ask their doctors questions. Even when you don’t have all the answers or know the “right” thing to say, simply being there for your child will help them feel loved and supported. Diagnostic Considerations OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Important considerations Note the following: It is important for clinicians to properly diagnose truncus arteriosus. Consider various abnormalities that may be associated with truncus arteriosus, some of which may have an impact on management and outcome. Also consider potential issues that are of particular concern in patients with truncus arteriosus, including pulmonary hypertensive crisis and volume overload in patients with persistent truncal valve regurgitation. Obtain routine laboratory and imaging studies (to include a full complement of echocardiographic views) in the neonate with truncus arteriosus to aid in determining therapeutic strategy and assist diagnosis. Consult with a cardiologist before beginning, changing, or discontinuing cardiac medications in these patients. Postnatal diagnosis For postnatal diagnosis, truncus arteriosus is suggested by the history and physical findings, along with abnormal results on the critical congenital heart disease screening test in the first few days after birth, showing preductal and postductal oxygen saturation less than 95% with mild or unnoticeable cyanosis. Unscreened infants present within the first 2 weeks for evaluation of a heart murmur, or with symptoms of congestive heart failure resulting from increased blood flow to the lungs. These infants exhibit poor feeding, lethargy, tachypnea, costal-sternal retractions, grunting, nasal flaring, tachycardia, or hepatomegaly. Other conditions to consider Consider the following in the differential diagnosis: Aortopulmonary septal defect Double outlet right ventricle with normally related great arteries Shock Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection Differential Diagnoses OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Bacterial Sepsis Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Transposition Pediatric Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome Pediatric Metabolic Acidosis Shock and Hypotension in the Newborn Tetralogy of Fallot with Absent Pulmonary Valve Transposition of the Great Arteries Epidemiology OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS An estimated incidence of 7 cases of truncus arteriosus occurs per 100,000 live births each year, comprising less than 1% of all congenital heart diseases but about 4% of critical congenital heart defects. United States data Truncus arteriosus represents 1-2% of congenital heart defects in liveborn infants. Based on an estimated incidence of congenital heart disease of 6-8 per 1,000 liveborn children, truncus arteriosus occurs in approximately 5-15 of 100,000 live births. Among aborted fetuses and stillborn infants with cardiovascular anomalies, truncus arteriosus represents almost 5% of defects. A population-based review of all cases of live births from 1999 to 2008 identified as having severe congenital heart disease from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database indicated a decrease of the conditions over the study period. There was a significant decreased incidence of truncus arteriosus as well as tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome; however, these trends varied with sociodemographic factors. The investigators suggested a possible reason for the decreasing prevalence trend was the increased numbers of terminated fetuses with prenatally diagnosed congenital heart disease. International data No significant difference in the incidence of truncus arteriosus is noted among those born in the United States compared with other countries (1-4% of congenital heart conditions. However, a Canadian longitudinal study (1983-2010) of all individuals with congenital heart disease noted a more than 50% increase of severe and other congenital heart disease after the year 2000, with adults comprising two thirds of the cases by 2010. The prevalence of congenital heart disease in the first year of life between 1998 and 2005 was 8.21 per 1000 live births; in 2010, the overall prevalence was 13.11 per 1000 in children and 6.12 per 1000 in adults. A temporal increase in prevalence of congenital heart disease and severe congenital heart disease was noted for children and adults. In a German retrospective study (2019-2024) of truncus arteriosus diagnosed prenatally at a local tertial referral center, 11 of 14 neonates survived to birth, of whom 7 had postnatal confirmation and underwent surgery, with an overall 55% survival. When the investigators performed a literature review, they noted there were 576 prenatal diagnoses of truncus arteriosus and 247 postnatal diagnoses, as well as 27% of tested cases demonstrated a 22q11 deletion. Race-, sex-, and age-related demographics Based on limited data, no racial predilection is apparent. Although many series report a slight male predominance, no significant predilection based on sex is apparent. Truncus arteriosus is a congenital anomaly that is present from early in embryonic gestation. Currently, truncus arteriosus is diagnosed using prenatal ultrasonography in a small percentage of patients. Among patients diagnosed after birth, the median age at presentation is generally a few days, which is significantly earlier than was the case 20 or more years ago. Occasionally, patients are not diagnosed until later in infancy, childhood, or even adulthood, although such cases are exceedingly rare in the United States and Europe. Procedures OF TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Cardiac catheterization For individuals with a late presentation, the ESC recommends cardiac catherization for evaluation of the pulmonary vascular resistance and for testing of the pulmonary vascular reactivity (class I). Standard angiographic images from the truncal root can aid in the assessment of the coronary arterial anatomy and complex pulmonary artery anatomy arising from the thoracic aorta, if echocardiography is inadequate, and in the assessment of regurgitation through the truncal valve. Cardiac catheterization is important in decision-making regarding the time and type of surgery to be performed (palliative vs corrective). Cardiac catheterization is generally not required prior to repair in neonates and young infants with truncus arteriosus. Catheterization is an important tool for evaluating some of the most common anatomic problems in patients with repaired truncus arteriosus, such as obstruction of the surgical reconstructed right ventricular outflow tract, branch pulmonary arterial stenosis, truncal valve regurgitation, and, in patients repaired later in life, pulmonary vascular obstructive disease. Transcatheter balloon dilation Treatment of pulmonary outflow tract or pulmonary arterial obstruction with transcatheter balloon dilation or stenting is an effective therapy for these problems in many patients who have undergone complex surgical repair. Biopsy Histologic examination is not generally indicated in the evaluation of patients with truncus arteriosus. In the rare older patient with evidence of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary biopsy is occasionally performed as a means of assessing the extent of pulmonary vascular obstructive disease. TREATMENT DRUG AND THEIR SIDE EFFECTS FOR TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS 1. Diuretics (e.g., Furosemide) Purpose: Reduce fluid overload and pulmonary congestion by promoting urine output, helping to relieve symptoms of congestive heart failure. Side Effects: Electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, sodium), dehydration, kidney dysfunction, increased urination. 2. Inotropic Agents (e.g., Digoxin, Milrinone) Purpose: Improve heart muscle contractility to enhance cardiac output and support circulation in heart failure. Side Effects: Digoxin: Narrow therapeutic window; risk of arrhythmias, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances. Requires monitoring of drug levels. Milrinone: May cause low blood pressure, arrhythmias, headache. 3. Afterload-Reducing Agents (e.g., ACE inhibitors like Captopril or Enalapril) Purpose: Decrease resistance against which the heart pumps, improving cardiac output and reducing heart failure symptoms. Side Effects: Hypotension, kidney impairment, cough, elevated potassium levels. 4. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) Purpose: Maintains ductus arteriosus patency in cases where systemic or pulmonary blood flow depends on ductal circulation (e.g., associated arch obstruction). Side Effects: Apnea (especially in neonates), flushing, low blood pressure. Surgical Treatment Definitive treatment is early surgical repair, usually within the first few weeks of life, involving: Closure of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) Separation of the pulmonary arteries from the common arterial trunk Reconstruction of the aorta Placement of a conduit with a valve between the right ventricle and pulmonary arteries. Lifelong follow-up is needed, and multiple surgeries or catheter-based interventions may be required as the child grows because conduits do not grow with the patient. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Q. What is truncus arteriosus? A. Truncus arteriosus is a rare congenital heart defect where a baby is born with a single large artery (truncus) coming out of the heart instead of two separate arteries—the aorta and the pulmonary artery. This causes oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix and flow to the body and lungs together. Q. What causes truncus arteriosus? A. It happens when the fetal heart’s large vessel fails to divide properly during development. Some cases are linked to genetic conditions like 22q11 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome), but often the exact cause is unknown. Q. What symptoms does truncus arteriosus cause? A. Symptoms usually appear in the first days or weeks of life and include: Blue or purple tint to lips, skin, and nails (cyanosis) Rapid or difficult breathing Poor feeding and poor weight gain Sweating, especially during feeding Fatigue and sleepiness Heart murmur heard by a doctor. Q. How is truncus arteriosus diagnosed? A. Diagnosis involves: Physical exam and pulse oximetry to check oxygen levels Echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) to visualize the heart’s structure Chest X-ray and sometimes cardiac MRI or catheterization for detailed assessment. Q. How is truncus arteriosus treated? A. Surgery is required, usually within the first few weeks of life. It involves closing the ventricular septal defect (VSD), separating the pulmonary arteries from the truncus, and connecting them to the right ventricle using a conduit with a valve. Before surgery, medical management includes medications to support heart function and breathing support if needed. Nutritional support may be necessary for infants with feeding difficulties. Q. What is the outlook for children with truncus arteriosus? A. Surgical repair improves survival significantly, but some children may require additional surgeries or interventions as they grow. Lifelong follow-up with a cardiologist experienced in congenital heart disease is essential. Q. Is truncus arteriosus associated with other conditions? A. Yes, about one-third of children with truncus arteriosus have 22q11 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome), which may cause other health issues and requires multidisciplinary care DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS Doctor: Hello, I want to talk with you about your baby’s heart condition called truncus arteriosus. Do you have any questions so far? Parent: Yes, we are trying to understand what it means. What exactly is truncus arteriosus? Doctor: Normally, the heart has two separate arteries coming out: the aorta, which carries oxygen-rich blood to the body, and the pulmonary artery, which carries oxygen-poor blood to the lungs. In truncus arteriosus, there is only one large artery coming out of the heart instead of two. This means oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood mix together and go to both the lungs and the body. Parent: What symptoms should we expect in our baby? Doctor: Babies with this condition often appear blue or have a bluish tint to their lips and skin because their blood doesn’t carry enough oxygen. They may breathe rapidly or have difficulty feeding and gaining weight. The heart has to work harder, which can cause sweating and fatigue. Parent: How is this diagnosed? Doctor: We use an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart, to see the structure and function. It shows the single artery and the hole between the heart’s lower chambers, called a ventricular septal defect. Chest X-rays and other tests may also be done to assess the heart size and lung circulation. Parent: What treatment does our baby need? Doctor: Surgery is necessary, usually within the first few weeks of life. The surgery closes the hole between the ventricles, separates the pulmonary arteries from the common artery, and connects them to the right ventricle using a tube graft. Before surgery, we may use medications to support the heart and keep blood flowing properly. Parent: What is the outlook after surgery? Doctor: Many children do well after surgery, especially if they survive the early post-operative period. However, they need lifelong follow-up with a cardiologist because additional surgeries or interventions may be needed as they grow. Parent: Is this condition related to any genetic problems? Doctor: Sometimes, truncus arteriosus is associated with a genetic condition called 22q11 deletion syndrome, which can cause other health issues. We can arrange genetic counseling and testing if needed. Parent: Thank you for explaining. What should we watch for at home? Doctor: Watch for worsening blue color, rapid breathing, poor feeding, or lethargy. If you notice any of these, seek medical attention promptly.

The pleura are thin membranes that line your lungs and the inside of your chest cavity. Normally, everyone has a small amount of fluid in their pleura. This fluid acts as a natural lubricant and makes it easier for your lungs to move when you breathe. But with pleural effusion, you have too much fluid around your lungs. This means your body is producing too much of the fluid or not absorbing enough of the fluid it makes. Types of pleural effusion Healthcare providers split pleural effusion into two types, depending on the kind of fluid around your lungs. Excess fluid may be: Protein-poor and watery (transudative). Fluid of this kind comes from cirrhosis or heart failure, for example. This type of pleural effusion happens when there’s an increase in pressure from the fluid. Protein-rich (exudative). Fluid of this kind comes from cancer or an infection, for example. This type of pleural effusion happens because too much fluid is getting through your smallest blood vessels, or your lymphatic system isn’t draining enough. Treatment varies by type and cause. Pleural effusions are very common. Healthcare providers find pleural effusions in about 1.5 million people in the United States each year. Symptoms and Causes OF Pleural effusion You may have unrelated symptoms due to the disease or condition that caused pleural effusion. Pleural effusion symptoms include: Chest pain. Coughing or deep breathing makes it worse. Dyspnea (shortness of breath, or difficult, labored breathing). Orthopnea (the inability to breathe easily unless you’re sitting up straight or standing up straight). Some people with pleural effusion have no symptoms. They find out they have pleural effusion when they have a chest X-ray for another reason. What causes pleural effusion? There are many causes of pleural effusion, and some people have more than one. Depending on the cause, the excess fluid may be either protein-poor (transudative) or protein-rich (exudative). These two categories help providers determine the cause of the pleural effusion. A pulmonary embolism (PE) can fall under either category. The most common causes of transudative (watery fluid) pleural effusions include: Heart failure. Cirrhosis. Nephrotic syndrome (a kidney issue). Common causes of exudative (protein-rich fluid) pleural effusions include: Pneumonia. Cancer (lung cancer, breast cancer or lymphoma). Kidney disease. Inflammatory disease. Post open-heart surgery. Less common causes of pleural effusion include: Tuberculosis. Autoimmune disease. Bleeding from chest trauma. Chylothorax (chyle from your lymphatic system after trauma). Rare chest and abdominal infections. Exposure to asbestos. Esophageal rupture. Pancreatitis. Meig’s syndrome (from a benign ovarian tumor). Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Certain medications. Abdominal surgery. Radiation therapy. In some cases, the fluid itself may have malignant (cancerous) cells or may be a direct result of chemotherapy. Risk factors for pleural effusion Risk factors for pleural effusion include: Medical conditions that cause it. Tobacco products. Exposure to asbestos. Complications of pleural effusion Pleural effusion can lead to: An infection that becomes an abscess. Scarring around the lungs. Damage to your lungs. Diagnosis and Tests OF Pleural effusion A provider will ask you about your medical history. They’ll ask what other illnesses you have and when your symptoms started. They’ll do a physical exam, which includes listening to your lungs when you breathe. Next, they’ll order tests. Healthcare providers use these tests to diagnose and evaluate pleural effusion: Chest X-ray. Computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest. Ultrasound of your chest. Thoracentesis or biopsy (inserting a needle between your ribs to remove a fluid sample). Pleural fluid analysis (examining the fluid from the pleural space). If less invasive tests don’t diagnose pleural effusion, you may need a thoracoscopy. Thoracoscopy is a minimally invasive technique, also known as video-assisted thoracic surgery, or VATS. A provider performs this while you’re under general anesthesia. Thoracoscopy allows them to see and evaluate your pleura. Often, they’ll treat your effusion during the thoracoscopy. Management and Treatment OF Pleural effusion Treatment of pleural effusion focuses on getting the excess fluid out and keeping it from collecting again. Providers choose pleural effusion treatment based on the underlying condition and whether the effusion is making it hard for you to breathe. Medicines Providers use diuretics and other heart failure medications to treat pleural effusion from congestive heart failure or other medical causes. Some people need antibiotics. For a malignant effusion, you may also need treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a medication infusion within your chest. Procedures OF Pleural effusion A provider can use therapeutic thoracentesis or a chest tube to drain a pleural effusion that’s causing respiratory symptoms. Even with drainage, you may have pleural effusions that are hard to control or that come back due to a malignancy. In this case, a provider puts a sclerosing agent (a type of drug that purposely creates scarring) into your pleural cavity through a chest tube. This causes fibrosis (excessive fibrous tissue) of the pleura (pleural sclerosis). This is 50% successful in preventing pleural effusions from happening again. Surgery You may need surgery if drainage or pleural sclerosis don’t work. Your surgeon will carefully evaluate you and discuss the possible risks and benefits of surgical pleural effusion treatments. The two types of surgery include: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). This minimally invasive approach uses one to three small (half-inch) incisions (cuts) in your chest. VATS can manage pleural effusions that are difficult to drain or that come back because of a tumor. A provider can insert sterile talc or an antibiotic during surgery to prevent fluid from building up again. Thoracotomy (traditional, “open” thoracic surgery). A surgeon performs a thoracotomy through a 6-inch to 8-inch incision in your chest. They use this approach when you have an infection. A thoracotomy removes all of the fibrous tissue and helps clear out the infection from the pleural space. You’ll need chest tubes for two days to two weeks after surgery to keep draining fluid. Complications/side effects of the treatment Complications of treatment may include: Pulmonary edema. Blood clots. Abnormal heart rhythms. Pneumothorax (collapsed lung). How long does it take to recover from this treatment? You may need to take it easy for two days after a thoracentesis. If you have VATS, you may need to spend a few days in the hospital afterward. After a thoracotomy (open surgery), you’ll probably be in the hospital for a week. Outlook / Prognosis OF Pleural effusion You may have follow-up X-rays after you receive treatment. Your provider will want to make sure the treatment worked well. You’ll also need treatment for the medical condition that caused pleural effusion. The seriousness of your condition depends on: The main cause of pleural effusion. If it’s affecting your breathing. If it responds well to treatment. Outlook for pleural effusion The outlook or prognosis varies depending on what caused your pleural effusion and what other conditions you have. For some people, pleural effusion treatment is successful. But pleural effusions can happen again. The outlook isn’t good when you have a pleural effusion from cancer. It’s also not good if you don’t get treatment for pleural effusion. Prevention OF Pleural effusion You may not be able to avoid the many causes of pleural effusion. But you can lower your risk of pleural effusions in these ways: Avoiding tobacco products. Avoiding asbestos. Sticking to low-salt meals if your provider instructs you to. Taking prescribed diuretics (water pills). Limiting fluid intake if your provider tells you to. Living With Pleural effusion Some medical conditions that cause pleural effusion require long-term treatment. Be sure to talk with your provider about the best treatment for your chronic (long-term) condition. Then, stick to the treatment plan. When should I see my healthcare provider? Go to all your follow-up appointments to manage your chronic condition. Get immediate help if you’re having trouble breathing. Diagnostic Considerations OF Pleural effusion Tests may need to be ordered to rule out immune dysfunction or other underlying systemic or local pulmonary disorders that cause empyema. Other conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis of pleural effusion include the following: Chest mass Pneumonia with pleurisy Pleural thickening Differential Diagnoses OF Pleural effusion Atelectasis Lung Abscess Pediatric Pneumonia Infectious Causes Parapneumonic effusion and empyema (most common; associated with bacterial pneumonia) Tuberculous pleuritis (especially in endemic areas; lymphocyte-predominant pleural fluid, elevated ADA) Viral infections (adenovirus, influenza) Fungal infections (rare, e.g., histoplasmosis) Parasitic infections (e.g., hydatid cyst disease) Non-Infectious Causes Congestive heart failure (transudative effusion due to increased hydrostatic pressure) Nephrotic syndrome (hypoalbuminemia causing transudative effusion) Liver cirrhosis (hepatic hydrothorax) Malignancies (primary pleural tumors or metastatic disease causing exudative effusion) Collagen vascular diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) Trauma or post-surgical effusions Chylothorax (lymphatic leakage causing milky pleural fluid) Pancreatitis (rare cause of pleural effusion) Other Considerations Chest wall masses or tumors causing secondary effusion Pulmonary embolism (rare in children but possible) Foreign body aspiration with secondary infection Epidemiology OF Pleural effusion Parapneumonic effusions and empyema are more common in boys than girls. In addition, parapneumonic effusions and mpyema are more commonly encountered in infants and young children than in older children. In a Spanish study, children younger than 5 years had a higher incidence of empyema than did children aged 5-17 years. Occurrence in the United States Pleural effusion in children is usually a manifestation of an underlying disorder, and its prevalence mirrors that of the underlying disease. Empyema was reported in about 0.6-2% of children with bacterial pneumonia. The prevalence of pleural infections appears to be increasing in some industrialized countries. In the United States, the empyema-associated hospitalization rate increased 70% between 1997 (2.2 per 100,000) and 2006 (3.7 per 100,000 children). Byington et al reported that a significant increase in the incidence of empyema in children, from 1 case per 100,000 children to 14 cases per 100,000 children, occurred in Utah between 1993 and 2003. International occurrence Information on the incidence of pleural effusion in children is limited. As in the United States, infectious agents are the most common cause of pediatric pleural effusion internationally. The distribution of pleural effusion depends on the population studied. In Spain, the incidence of parapneumonic effusion in children younger than age 5 years increased from 1.7 per 100,000 (in 1999) to 8.5 per 100,000 (in 2004). In France, the incidence of empyema increased from 0.5 per 100,000 (in 1995) to 13 per 100,000 (in 2003). Antibiotic Therapy In the earlier stages of parapneumonic effusion formation (mild symptoms, short duration), institution of appropriate empiric antibiotics, based on the patient\\'s age and the organisms and sensitivities commonly present in the community, may discourage a small effusion from developing into a complicated parapneumonic effusion. Whenever possible, a pleural fluid sampling should be performed prior to the initiation of antibiotics. If a causative organism is identified, antibiotic choice should be guided by the sensitivity pattern of the organism. Some groups of antibiotics (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins, aztreonam, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin) exhibit more satisfactory pleural fluid penetration than others (e.g., aminoglycosides). In a hospitalized patient with complicated parapneumonic effusion, antibiotics are commonly administered intravenously while a thoracostomy tube is present and the patient is febrile. No data from randomized trials on an appropriate length of treatment are available, and no data on whether different organisms require different durations are noted. Many centers continue with intravenous antibiotics at least 48 hours after the patient is afebrile and the chest drain is removed. Thereafter, oral antibiotics are commonly continued for 2-4 weeks. A study by Tagarro et al that included 60 randomized children with community-acquired pneumonia and pleural effusion reported that patients receiving dexamethasone along with antibiotics had a shorter time to recovery than the placebo group PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Pleural effusion Q. What is pleural effusion in children? A. Pleural effusion is when excess fluid builds up in the pleural space—the thin area between the lungs and chest wall. This fluid can cause chest pressure, difficulty breathing, and low oxygen levels. Q. What causes pleural effusion in children? A. The most common cause is lung infection or pneumonia. Other causes include heart failure, kidney or liver problems, chest injury, inflammation (like pancreatitis), surgery, and some rare diseases. Q. What symptoms might my child have? A. Symptoms can include: Shortness of breath or rapid breathing Cough Sharp chest pain that worsens with coughing or deep breaths Fever and chills Fatigue Sometimes hiccups or abdominal pain. Q. How is pleural effusion diagnosed? A. Doctors listen to the lungs and may notice decreased breath sounds. Diagnosis is confirmed with: Chest X-rays (sometimes in different positions) Ultrasound or CT scan for detailed imaging Pleural fluid analysis obtained by needle drainage to identify infection or other causes. Q. How is pleural effusion treated? A. Small effusions often improve with treatment of the underlying cause, such as antibiotics for pneumonia. Large or infected effusions (empyema) may require drainage with a chest tube. In some cases, surgery or minimally invasive procedures (like VATS) may be needed to remove thick fluid or pus. Supportive care includes oxygen and pain management. Q. What is empyema? A. Empyema is when the pleural fluid becomes infected and thickens into pus. It usually requires more intensive treatment like drainage and longer antibiotic courses. Q. What is the outlook for children with pleural effusion? A. Most children recover well with prompt treatment. Early drainage of infected fluid reduces complications and improves outcomes. The prognosis depends on the underlying cause and treatment. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Pleural effusion Doctor: Hello, I want to discuss your child’s recent diagnosis of pleural effusion. Do you have any questions so far? Parent: Yes, can you explain what pleural effusion means? Doctor: Certainly. Pleural effusion is when excess fluid builds up in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. This fluid can make it harder for your child to breathe because it restricts lung expansion. Parent: What causes this fluid to build up? Doctor: In children, the most common cause is infection, like pneumonia. Other causes include heart problems, kidney or liver diseases, or sometimes inflammation or injury. We’ll do tests to find out the exact cause. Parent: What symptoms should we watch for? Doctor: Your child might have difficulty breathing, cough, chest pain that worsens with deep breaths, or fever if infection is involved. Sometimes they may feel tired or have less appetite. Parent: How do you confirm the diagnosis? Doctor: We use chest X-rays and ultrasound to see the fluid. Sometimes we take a sample of the fluid with a needle to test for infection or other causes. Parent: How is it treated? Doctor: Treatment depends on the cause. If it’s due to pneumonia, antibiotics are given. If the fluid is large or infected, we may need to drain it using a small tube. Small effusions might just be monitored. Parent: Is the procedure painful? Doctor: We use local anesthesia to minimize discomfort. Your child might feel some pressure but it’s generally well tolerated. Parent: What is the outlook? Doctor: Most children recover well with treatment. Early drainage of infected fluid helps prevent complications and improves breathing. Parent: Thank you, doctor. That helps me understand what’s going on. Doctor: You’re welcome. Please call us if your child’s breathing worsens, fever persists, or if you have any concerns. REFERENCES Pleural Effusion: Symptoms, Causes & Treatment https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1003121-treatment#d9 Pneumococcal Pneumonia DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Pneumococcal Pneumonia Pneumococcal pneumonia is a potentially serious bacterial lung disease you shouldn\\'t ignore. It can disrupt your life for weeks and even land you in the hospital. Cause: OF Pneumococcal Pneumonia Pneumococcal pneumonia is a bacterial lung infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common cause of pneumonia in children worldwide. Symptoms: Children may present with cough, fever, rapid or difficult breathing, chest pain (especially with coughing or deep breaths), lethargy, and sometimes bluish discoloration of lips or nails due to low oxygen levels. Diagnosis: Clinical evaluation includes physical exam and listening to the lungs. Chest X-ray helps confirm pneumonia and assess severity. Laboratory tests and cultures may be done in severe cases. Treatment: The first-line antibiotic for treating pediatric pneumonia, including pneumococcal pneumonia, is amoxicillin (often as dispersible tablets), given orally in mild to moderate cases. Severe cases may require hospitalization with intravenous antibiotics and supportive care such as oxygen. Treatment duration typically lasts several days, and improvement is usually seen within 24-48 hours of starting antibiotics. Prevention: Vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15 or PCV20) starting at 2 months of age is highly effective in preventing pneumococcal disease. Other vaccines like Hib, measles, and influenza vaccines also reduce pneumonia risk. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months and reducing indoor air pollution improve natural defenses. Good hygiene and nutrition further reduce risk. Prognosis: Most children recover fully with timely antibiotic treatment. Severe infections can lead to complications requiring hospitalization. Epidemiology OF Pneumococcal Pneumonia United States statistics Pneumonia can occur at any age, although it is more common in younger children. Pneumonia accounts for 13% of all infectious illnesses in infants younger than 2 years of age. In a large community-based study conducted by Denny and Clyde, the annual incidence rate of pneumonia was 4 cases per 100 children in the preschool-aged group, 2 cases per 100 children aged 5-9 years, and 1 case per 100 children aged 9-15 years. Thompson et al reported that, after elderly persons, the second highest rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States were in children younger than 5 years of age. These investigators evaluated annual influenza-associated hospitalizations by hospital discharge category, discharge type, and age group. In a randomized double-blind trial, the heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine reduced the incidence of clinically diagnosed and radiographically diagnosed pneumonia among children younger than 5 years of age by 4% and 20%, respectively. Although the overall rate of pneumonia has decreased in the United States with the use of the 7-valent vaccine, the rate of empyema and complicated pneumonia has increased. Following the use of the 13-valent conjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, the overall rates of pneumonia are anticipated to drop further. The new vaccine includes serotypes that have become associated with complicated or antibiotic-resistant disease (19A and 6A, for example). Among school-aged children and adolescents, bronchopneumonia occurs in 0.8-2% of all pertussis cases and 16-20% of hospitalized cases. M pneumoniae accounts for 14-35% of pneumonia hospitalizations in this age group, and mycobacterial pneumonia has recently been noted with increasing frequency in some inner-city areas, particularly among children in homeless shelters and group homes and those with household contacts. International statistics Pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of death worldwide. The WHO Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group estimated the median global incidence of clinical pneumonia to be 0.28 episodes per child-year. This corresponds to an annual incidence of 150.7 million new cases, of which 11-20 million (7-13%) are severe enough to require hospital admission. Ninety-five percent of all episodes of clinical pneumonia in young children worldwide occur in developing countries. Approximately 150 million new cases of pneumonia occur annually among children younger than 5 years of age worldwide. This accounts for approximately 10-20 million hospitalizations. A WHO Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group publication cited the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia among children younger than 5 years of age in developed countries as approximately 0.026 episodes per child-year. In addition, a study conducted in the United Kingdom showed that 59% of deaths from pertussis are associated with pneumonia. Diagnostic Considerations OF Pneumococcal Pneumonia Pneumonia can occur at any age, although it is more common in younger children. Different age groups tend to be infected by different pathogens, which affects diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Many patients referred for evaluation for recurrent pneumonia are diagnosed with asthma. In emergency department studies, 35% of children with an asthma exacerbation have abnormalities visible on chest radiographs. In a child not yet diagnosed with asthma, these abnormalities are frequently interpreted simply as pneumonia. Inflammation, often triggered by viral infection, is part of the asthmatic response. Wheezing responsive to bronchodilators, a history of atopy, a family history of asthma, and a history of cough or wheeze with exercise may be helpful in identifying such patients. Consider any other diseases that may present with respiratory dysfunction in the first 24 hours of life. Keep in mind that any of the conditions listed below may also be superimposed by pneumonia: Alveolar-capillary dysplasia Arrhythmia Asphyxia Bronchial duplication Chest wall injury or anomaly Choanal atresia Chylothorax Diaphragmatic eventration Heart block Intracranial hemorrhage Laryngeal cleft Laryngeal nerve injury Mutation of ABCA3 gene (for surfactant phospholipid transport) Neuromuscular disorders Phrenic nerve injury Pulmonary hemorrhage Pulmonary hypoplasia Pulmonary lymphangiectasia Spinal injury Surfactant-related protein B deficiency Tachycardia syndromes Tracheoesophageal fistula Transplacental medications Vascular catheter accident Other causes of airway obstruction Other congenital heart diseases Other inborn errors of metabolism Other neuromuscular diseases A careful history and examination in patients with recurrent pneumonia are both very helpful to further narrow the differential diagnosis. However, additional testing is often needed to confirm most of these diagnoses and is generally outside the scope of a primary care provider.

Amoxicillin (First-line oral antibiotic) Use: Preferred for outpatient treatment of mild to moderate pneumococcal pneumonia in children under 5 years and school-aged children. Dosage: Typically given twice daily for 3–7 days depending on severity. Side Effects: Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) Allergic reactions (rash, rarely anaphylaxis) Possible alteration of gut flora leading to yeast infections. 2. Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (Augmentin) Use: Alternative when beta-lactamase producing organisms or mixed infections are suspected or in treatment failure. Side Effects: Similar to amoxicillin but higher risk of diarrhea and gastrointestinal discomfort. 3. Macrolides (Azithromycin, Clarithromycin) Use: Added or alternative therapy in school-aged children to cover atypical pathogens (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae) and some pneumococcal strains. Side Effects: Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, abdominal pain) Rare QT prolongation and arrhythmias Possible drug interactions. 4. Cephalosporins (Cefuroxime, Cefdinir, Ceftriaxone) Use: For hospitalized or severe cases, intravenous or oral cephalosporins are used. Ceftriaxone is common for inpatient therapy. Side Effects: Allergic reactions (rash, anaphylaxis in penicillin-allergic patients) Diarrhea, including risk of Clostridioides difficile infection Injection site reactions (for IV forms). 5. Vancomycin or Clindamycin Use: Reserved for suspected or confirmed methicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae or S. aureus infections in severe cases. Side Effects: Vancomycin: Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, “red man syndrome” (infusion reaction) Clindamycin: Diarrhea, risk of C. difficile colitis. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Pneumococcal Pneumonia Q. What is pneumococcal pneumonia? A. Pneumococcal pneumonia is a lung infection caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is a common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children and can sometimes lead to serious illness like bloodstream infections or meningitis. Q. What are the symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia in children? A. Symptoms include fever, cough, rapid or difficult breathing, chest pain, lethargy, poor appetite, and sometimes bluish discoloration of lips or nails due to low oxygen levels. Q. How is pneumococcal pneumonia diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical evaluation and chest X-ray. Blood tests and cultures may be done in severe cases to identify the bacteria and guide treatment. Q. How is pneumococcal pneumonia treated? A. Treatment involves antibiotics, with amoxicillin being the first-line choice for most children. Severe cases may require hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics and supportive care like oxygen. Q. Can pneumococcal pneumonia be prevented? A. Yes. Vaccination is the most effective prevention. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15 or PCV20) are given starting at 2 months of age in a series of doses. Keeping up with flu vaccines and good hygiene also helps reduce risk. Q. Are pneumococcal vaccines safe? A. Yes, pneumococcal vaccines are safe and effective. Common side effects include pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site, mild fever, or irritability. Serious allergic reactions are very rare. Q. Can a child get pneumococcal pneumonia more than once? A. Yes. There are over 100 different types of pneumococcus bacteria, so infection with one type does not provide immunity against others. Q. Who is at higher risk for pneumococcal pneumonia? A. Young children under 5 years, the elderly, and those with certain medical conditions like immune deficiencies or chronic illnesses are at higher risk. What should I do if I suspect my child has pneumococcal pneumonia? Seek medical care promptly if your child has difficulty breathing, persistent fever, lethargy, or bluish lips. Early diagnosis and treatment improve outcomes DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Pneumococcal Pneumonia Doctor: Hello, I understand your child has been diagnosed with pneumonia. I want to explain what that means and how we will treat it. Parent: Thank you, doctor. What exactly is pneumonia? Doctor: Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs that causes inflammation and fluid buildup, making it harder for your child to breathe. In children, pneumonia can be caused by viruses or bacteria. One common bacterial cause is Streptococcus pneumoniae, which we call pneumococcal pneumonia. Parent: How do you know it’s caused by these bacteria? Doctor: Sometimes it’s hard to tell the exact cause right away. We look at symptoms, physical exam, and chest X-rays. If your child is very sick, we might do blood tests or cultures. Because pneumococcus is a common cause, we often start antibiotics that work well against it. Parent: What treatment will my child need? Doctor: For most children with pneumococcal pneumonia, we prescribe an antibiotic called amoxicillin, which your child will take by mouth. It usually helps improve symptoms within a couple of days. If your child has trouble breathing or is very sick, hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics may be needed. Parent: Are there any side effects from the antibiotics? Doctor: Some children may have mild stomach upset, diarrhea, or a rash. Serious allergic reactions are rare. It’s important to give the full course of antibiotics even if your child feels better sooner. Parent: How can we prevent this from happening again? Doctor: Vaccination is the best prevention. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is given starting at 2 months of age and protects against many types of pneumococcal bacteria. Also, good hand hygiene and avoiding exposure to sick people help reduce risk. Parent: What should I watch for while my child is sick? Doctor: Watch for worsening breathing difficulty, persistent high fever, lethargy, or if your child is not drinking fluids. If any of these happen, seek medical care promptly. Parent: Thank you, doctor. This helps me understand the illness and how to care for my child. Doctor: You’re welcome. Please call us if you have any questions or concerns during your child’s recovery.

It causes fluid and blood to collect around your lungs. Its symptoms can sometimes be vague, like coughing or wheezing, until the injury is severe. A pulmonary contusion is a serious condition that can cause life-threatening complications. Healthcare providers will need to monitor you in a hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU). Symptoms and Causes OF Pulmonary contusion Symptoms of a pulmonary contusion include: Trouble breathing or shortness of breath. Coughing. Wheezing. Fast heart rate (tachycardia). Coughing up blood. Chest pain. Bruises on your chest. Symptoms can appear right after an injury or several hours to days later. You might notice slight changes, like a cough or breathlessness, before your symptoms become serious. What causes a pulmonary contusion? Blunt force trauma (impact with something dull) or a penetrating injury (one that goes through your skin and deeper tissues) causes a pulmonary contusion. The most common cause is injury from a car accident. Other causes can be explosions and stab wounds. These injuries damage the blood vessels around your lungs, so blood and other fluids collect in your lung tissues. Anyone who’s had an injury that impacts their chest is at risk for a pulmonary contusion. Children are at higher risk for serious complications. Complications of a pulmonary contusion Pulmonary contusions can lead to serious complications, including: Pneumonia. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Hypoxia, a condition where not enough oxygen is getting to your tissues. Hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, conditions where you have too much carbon dioxide in your blood. Diagnosis and Tests OF Pulmonary contusion Healthcare providers diagnose a pulmonary contusion by getting images of your lungs. Imaging methods they might use include: Chest X-rays. Thoracic (chest) ultrasound. CT scan (computed tomography scan). Management and Treatment OF Pulmonary contusion There’s no specific treatment for pulmonary contusion. Healthcare providers will monitor you in the hospital and work to keep your condition stable while you heal. Some medications and procedures they might use to prevent complications and keep you comfortable include: Oxygen therapy. Pain medications. Pulmonary hygiene. Fluid drainage. Surgery to repair damage. Mechanical ventilation. Outlook / Prognosis OF Pulmonary contusion Pulmonary contusions take about a week to heal. Depending on the severity of your condition, you may need to stay in the hospital for longer. Some people need surgery to repair damage to their lungs or chest. Up to 20% of people with a pulmonary contusion develop pneumonia. It’s important to practice good pulmonary hygiene, including coughing up mucous and deep breathing. People who’ve had a pulmonary contusion sometimes have reduced lung function for years after the contusion heals. This can make it hard to breathe. You might also have long-lasting scarring (fibrosis). It’s hard to know the exact mortality rate from a pulmonary contusion. But studies estimate it to be between 14% and 40%. Prevention OF Pulmonary contusion The only way to prevent a contusion is to avoid injury to your chest. Always wear your seatbelt when you’re driving or riding in a vehicle. WHEN TO SEE THE DOCTOR Go to an emergency room right away if you’ve had an injury to your chest. Even if you feel fine, having a healthcare provider check you out is always best. Call 911 if you’re having any of these symptoms: Chest pain. Difficulty breathing. Bluish skin, lips or nails. Dizziness. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF Pulmonary contusion Pulmonary contusion (bruise of lung tissue after blunt chest trauma) Pulmonary laceration (tear in lung parenchyma, may cause pneumatoceles or air leaks) Pneumothorax (air in pleural space causing lung collapse) Hemothorax (blood in pleural space following trauma) Atelectasis (collapse of lung segments due to mucus plugging or compression) Aspiration pneumonia (infection from inhaled material, often with patchy infiltrates) Pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in lungs from cardiac or non-cardiac causes) Infectious pneumonia (bacterial or viral lung infection causing consolidation) Pulmonary embolism (rare in children, but can cause respiratory distress and infarcts) Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (severe inflammatory lung injury that can follow trauma or infection) EPIDEMIOLOGY OF Pulmonary contusion Epidemiology of Pediatric Pulmonary Contusions: Pulmonary contusions are the most common chest injury in children following blunt thoracic trauma, with an incidence ranging from 27% to over 50% of pediatric chest trauma cases in various studies. In a large Dutch trauma registry study, among children admitted with chest injuries, lung contusions accounted for 40.5% of injuries, making them the most prevalent thoracic injury in pediatric trauma. Chest trauma in children is relatively infrequent but remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The overall incidence of pediatric chest injuries is about 4.9 per 100,000 person-years. The median age of affected children is around 10 to 11 years, with a male predominance (~60%). The leading causes of pulmonary contusions in children are blunt trauma mechanisms, especially motor vehicle accidents and pedestrian injuries, with pedestrian trauma accounting for approximately 26% to 72% of cases in some studies. Unlike adults, children can sustain pulmonary contusions without rib fractures due to the greater flexibility of their chest wall. Mortality rates related to pediatric chest trauma, including pulmonary contusions, range from 6% to 7%, with higher mortality associated with multiple trauma and severe injuries. Pulmonary contusions can progress to complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which carries a mortality of approximately 10–25% in severe cases. Most pediatric chest trauma cases (80–90%) are due to closed (blunt) trauma, with pulmonary contusions being a common injury pattern within this group PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Pulmonary contusion Q. What is a pulmonary contusion in children? A. A pulmonary contusion is a bruise of the lung tissue caused by blunt chest trauma. It leads to bleeding and fluid leakage into the lung’s alveoli, impairing oxygen exchange and causing respiratory difficulties. Q. How common are pulmonary contusions in pediatric trauma? A. Pulmonary contusions are the most common intrathoracic injury in children after blunt chest trauma. They occur in about 27–50% of pediatric chest trauma cases and are a significant cause of morbidity. Q. Why are children more prone to pulmonary contusions without rib fractures? A. Children’s chest walls are more flexible and compliant, so their ribs often do not fracture during trauma. However, this flexibility allows more force to be transmitted to the lung tissue, increasing the risk of contusions. Q. What symptoms do children with pulmonary contusions show? A. Symptoms can include chest pain, rapid or difficult breathing, coughing, low oxygen levels (hypoxia), and respiratory distress. Symptoms may worsen over 24–48 hours after injury. Q. How is pulmonary contusion diagnosed? A. Initial diagnosis is usually by chest X-ray, but contusions may not appear immediately. CT scans detect contusions earlier and more precisely but are not always necessary. Clinical assessment and oxygen levels guide management. Q. How is pulmonary contusion treated in children? A. There is no specific cure; treatment is supportive: Oxygen therapy as needed Pain control to allow effective breathing and coughing Pulmonary hygiene (incentive spirometry, physiotherapy) Non-invasive ventilation (e.g., BiPAP) may help reduce work of breathing Mechanical ventilation if respiratory failure occurs Fluid management to avoid overload Antibiotics are not routinely given unless infection develops. Q. What complications can occur? A. Complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure. Close monitoring is essential to detect and treat these promptly. Q. How long does it take for a pulmonary contusion to heal? A. Pulmonary contusions generally improve over about one week, but recovery depends on severity and complications. Q. When should a child with chest trauma be evaluated for pulmonary contusion? A. Any child with blunt chest trauma and respiratory symptoms should be evaluated promptly, especially if breathing is difficult or oxygen levels are low. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Pulmonary contusion Doctor: Hello, I want to talk with you about your child’s lung injury called a pulmonary contusion. Do you have any questions before we start? Parent: Yes, doctor. What exactly is a pulmonary contusion? Doctor: A pulmonary contusion is essentially a bruise of the lung tissue caused by a blunt injury to the chest, like from a fall or car accident. This injury causes bleeding and swelling inside the lungs, which can make it harder for your child to breathe properly. Parent: How serious is this? Will my child have trouble breathing? Doctor: The severity depends on how much of the lung is affected. Some children have mild symptoms and just need oxygen and monitoring, while others may have more difficulty breathing and need extra support. Because the lung tissue becomes stiff and filled with fluid, it can reduce oxygen exchange. Parent: How do you know how bad it is? Doctor: We use chest X-rays to look for signs of contusion, but sometimes the injury doesn’t show up right away. A CT scan can detect it earlier and more precisely, but we usually base treatment on how your child is doing clinically—how well they are breathing and their oxygen levels. Parent: What treatment will my child need? Doctor: Treatment is mostly supportive. We give oxygen if needed, manage pain so your child can breathe deeply and cough, and encourage pulmonary hygiene like breathing exercises. In some cases, non-invasive ventilation like BiPAP can help reduce the work of breathing. We try to avoid mechanical ventilation if possible, but if breathing worsens, it might be necessary. Parent: Will my child need antibiotics? Doctor: Not routinely. Antibiotics are only used if there is a confirmed infection like pneumonia. Pulmonary contusions themselves are not infections. Parent: How long will it take for my child to get better? Doctor: Most pulmonary contusions improve over about a week, but it depends on the injury’s extent and whether complications develop. We will monitor closely for any signs of worsening. Parent: Is there anything we should watch for at home? Doctor: Yes. If your child develops increased difficulty breathing, persistent low oxygen levels, fever, or becomes unusually sleepy or irritable, please seek medical attention promptly. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything clearly. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’ll keep monitoring your child carefully and adjust treatment as needed. Please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any concerns. REFERENCES Pulmonary Contusion: Causes, Symptoms & Treatment https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558914/ PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the valve between the lower right heart chamber and the lung arteries. In a narrowed heart valve, the valve flaps may become thick or stiff. This reduces blood flow through the valve. Usually, pulmonary valve disease is caused by a heart problem that develops before birth. A heart problem present at birth is called a congenital heart defect. In adults, pulmonary valve stenosis may be a complication of another illness. Pulmonary valve stenosis ranges from mild to severe. Some people with mild pulmonary valve stenosis don\\'t have symptoms. They may need only occasional health checkups. Moderate and severe pulmonary valve stenosis may need a procedure to repair or replace the valve Causes OF PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS Pulmonary valve stenosis usually results from a heart problem present at birth. The exact cause is unclear. The pulmonary valve doesn\\'t develop properly as the baby is growing in the womb. The pulmonary valve is made of three thin pieces of tissue called flaps, also called cusps. The cusps open and close with each heartbeat. They make sure blood moves in the right direction. In pulmonary valve stenosis, one or more of the cusps may be stiff or thick. Sometimes the cusps may be joined together. That means they are fused. So the valve doesn\\'t open fully. The smaller opening makes it harder for blood to leave the lower right heart chamber. Pressure increases inside the chamber. The increased pressure strains the heart. Eventually the lower right heart chamber wall gets thicker. Risk factors OF PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS Things that may increase the risk of pulmonary valve stenosis include: German measles, also called rubella. Having German measles during pregnancy increases the risk of pulmonary valve stenosis in the baby. Noonan syndrome. This condition is caused by altered deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). It can lead to many problems with the heart\\'s structure and function. Rheumatic fever. This complication of strep throat can cause permanent damage to the heart and heart valves. It increases the risk of developing pulmonary valve stenosis later in life. Carcinoid syndrome. This condition occurs when a rare cancerous tumor releases certain chemicals into the bloodstream. It causes shortness of breath, flushing and other symptoms. Some people with this syndrome develop carcinoid heart disease, which damages heart valves. Symptoms OF PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS Pulmonary valve stenosis symptoms depend on how much blood flow is blocked. Some people with mild pulmonary stenosis do not have symptoms. Those with more-severe pulmonary stenosis may first notice symptoms while exercising. Pulmonary valve stenosis symptoms may include: A whooshing sound called a heart murmur that can be heard with a stethoscope. Fatigue. Shortness of breath, especially during activity. Chest pain. Fainting. Babies with pulmonary valve stenosis may have blue or gray skin due to low oxygen levels. When to see a doctor Talk to your health care provider if you or your child has: Shortness of breath. Chest pain. Fainting. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary valve stenosis can help reduce the risk of complications. Diagnosis OF PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS Pulmonary valve stenosis is often diagnosed in childhood. But it may not be detected until later in life. A health care provider uses a stethoscope to listen to the heart. A whooshing sound, called a heart murmur, may be heard. The sound is caused by choppy blood flow across the narrowed valve. Tests to diagnose pulmonary valve stenosis include: Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick and painless test records the electrical signals in the heart. Sticky patches, called electrodes, are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which displays the test results. An ECG can show how the heart is beating and may reveal signs of heart muscle thickening. Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to produce images of the heart. This common test shows how the heart beats and pumps blood. An echocardiogram can show the shape of the pulmonary valve. The test can show how much of the valve is narrowed. Cardiac catheterization. A thin tube called a catheter is inserted into the groin and threaded through the blood vessels to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter into the blood vessels to make them show up more clearly on X-rays. This part of the test is called a coronary angiogram. During the test, pressures within the heart can be measured to see how forcefully blood pumps through the heart. A provider can determine the severity of pulmonary stenosis by checking the difference in pressure between the right lower heart chamber and the lung artery. Other imaging tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans are sometimes used to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary valve stenosis. Treatment OF PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS If you have mild pulmonary valve stenosis without symptoms, you may only need occasional health checkups. If you have moderate or severe pulmonary valve stenosis, you may need a heart procedure or heart surgery. The type of procedure or surgery done depends on your overall health and the appearance of your pulmonary valve. Surgeries or other procedures Pulmonary valve stenosis treatment may include: Balloon valvuloplasty. The provider inserts a flexible tube with a balloon on the tip into an artery, usually in the groin. X-rays help guide the tube, called a catheter, to the narrowed valve in the heart. The balloon inflates, making the valve opening larger. The balloon is deflated. The catheter and balloon are removed. Valvuloplasty may improve blood flow through the heart and reduce pulmonary valve stenosis symptoms. But the valve may narrow again. Some people need valve repair or replacement in the future. Pulmonary valve replacement. If balloon valvuloplasty isn\\'t an option, open-heart surgery or a catheter procedure may be done to replace the pulmonary valve. If there are other heart problems, the surgeon may repair those during the same surgery. People who have had pulmonary valve replacement need to take antibiotics before certain dental procedures or surgeries to prevent endocarditis. Self-care OF PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS If you have valve disease, it\\'s important to take steps to keep your heart healthy. Certain lifestyle changes can decrease your risk of developing other types of heart disease or having a heart attack. Lifestyle changes to talk about with your health care provider include: Quitting smoking. Eating a heart-healthy diet that includes fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, and lean meat. Maintaining a healthy weight. Getting regular exercise. Complications OF PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS Possible complications of pulmonary stenosis include: Infection of the lining of the heart, called infective endocarditis. People with heart valve problems, such as pulmonary stenosis, have an increased risk of developing bacterial infections that affect the inner lining of the heart. Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. People with pulmonary stenosis are more likely to have irregular heartbeats. Unless the stenosis is severe, irregular heartbeats due to pulmonary stenosis usually aren\\'t life-threatening. Thickening of the heart muscle. In severe pulmonary stenosis, the lower right heart chamber must pump harder to force blood into the pulmonary artery. The strain on the heart causes the muscular wall of the ventricle to thicken. The condition is called right ventricular hypertrophy. Heart failure. If the right ventricle can\\'t pump properly, heart failure eventually develops. Symptoms of heart failure include fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling of the legs and belly area. Pregnancy complications. The risks of complications during labor and delivery are higher for those with severe pulmonary valve stenosis than for those without it Diagnostic Considerations OF PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS Other conditions to be considered in patients with suspected pulmonic stenosis (pulmonary stenosis) (PS) include the following: Associated or different congenital heart abnormalities Rheumatic valvular heart disease Carcinoid heart disease Pulmonic stenosis in pregnancy Valvular heart disease, including PS, warrants follow-up care by a high-risk obstetrics team. The hemodynamic changes in pregnancy are significant and include relative anemia due to increased plasma volume proportionally greater than red blood cell volume, increase in cardiac stroke volume, decrease in systemic vascular resistance, decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance with a drop in pulmonary pressures and, finally, decrease in venous return that is more marked in the third trimester. Pregnancy, in the already symptomatic woman with severe PS, can worsen symptoms. However, pregnancy is generally well tolerated in asymptomatic women with PS, even if the degree of stenosis is severe. When symptoms are referable to PS, they are similar to those of individuals who are not pregnant and symptomatic. The symptoms of healthy pregnancy can resemble those of PS, including exertional fatigue, dyspnea, orthopnea, presyncope, and, rarely, frank syncope. Palpitations due to arrhythmias have been noted to be more common in those with PS. Mild PS produces a murmur similar to that of the benign flow murmur of pregnancy, which typically increases in intensity as the stroke volume is augmented. During the physical examination, this murmur can be distinguished from the flow murmur of pregnancy by noting a prominent jugular venous a wave, an RV lift, a systolic thrill over the pulmonic area, a pulmonic ejection sound (in doming PS), and a diminished or absent P2. Electrocardiographic (ECG) and echocardiographic evaluation are essential in confirming clinical suspicion. Fetal echocardiography is indicated in patients with PS or tetralogy of Fallot. Treatment of PS during pregnancy Balloon valvuloplasty is recommended in nonpregnant, asymptomatic patients with a peak instantaneous gradient >60 mmHg or mean Doppler gradient >40 mmHg (provided there is less than moderate pulmonary regurgitation). In the presence of symptoms, balloon valvuloplasty is indicated for a peak instantaneous gradinet of >50 mmHg or mean gradient >30 mmHg (with the same caveat of less than moderate pulmonary regurgitation). If severe symptomatic PS is detected during pregnancy, percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty to relieve the obstruction usually can be accomplished safely, obviating the need to terminate the pregnancy. Arrhythmias are treated according to the severity and etiology. Considerations for labor and delivery Patients who are asymptomatic during pregnancy generally tolerate labor and delivery well. For more severe valvular disease, a high-risk obstetrics team along with a cardiology consultation may be required to manage deliveries. Differential Diagnoses OF PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS Benign Cardiac Tumors Cardiac Sarcoma Primary Cardiac Neoplasms Sinus of Valsalva Aneurysm Epidemiology United States data Pulmonic stenosis (pulmonary stenosis) (PS) is a common form of congenital heart disease that occasionally is diagnosed for the first time in adulthood. Isolated valvular PS comprises approximately 10% of all congenital heart disease in the United States. About 2% of familial occurrences are without a genetic cause. Sex-related demographics A slight female predominance exists GUIDELINES OF PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS Select class I and III recommendations are outlined. RV Outflow Tract Obstruction (OTO) In valvular pulmonary stenosis (PS), balloon valvuloplasty is the intervention of choice, if anatomically suitable. As long as no valve replacement is required, RVOTO intervention at any level is recommended regardless of symptoms when the stenosis is severe (Doppler peak gradient >64 mmHg). If surgical valve replacement is the only option, it is indicated in (1) symptomatic patients with severe stenosis; or (2) asymptomatic patients with severe stenosis in the presence of ≥1 of the following: Objective decrease in exercise capacity Falling RV function and/or progression of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) to at least moderate RV systolic pressure (SP) >80 mmHg Right-to-left (RL) shunting via an ASD or VSD CHD-Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) Counsel patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) and confirmed precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) against pregnancy. All patients with PAH-CHD should undergo risk assessment. In low- and intermediate-risk patients with repaired simple lesions and precapillary PH, initial oral combination therapy or sequential combination therapy is recommended; treat high-risk patients with initial combination therapy including parenteral proteinoids. After Repair of Tetralogy of Fallot Pulmonary valve replacement (PVRep) is recommended in symptomatic patients with severe pulmonary regurgitation (PR) and/or at least moderate RVOTO. In those without a native outflow tract, catheter intervention (transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation [TPVI]) is preferred if anatomically feasible. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS Q. What is pulmonary stenosis in children? A. Pulmonary stenosis is a congenital heart defect where the pulmonary valve or the area around it is narrowed, making it harder for blood to flow from the right ventricle to the lungs. This causes the heart to work harder to pump blood. Q. What causes pulmonary stenosis? A. Most cases are present at birth due to abnormal development of the pulmonary valve or surrounding structures during fetal growth. The exact cause is usually unknown, and it is not related to anything the mother did during pregnancy. Q. What are the symptoms of pulmonary stenosis in children? A. Many children with mild pulmonary stenosis have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include: A heart murmur heard by a doctor Fatigue or tiredness, especially during activity Shortness of breath Bluish tint to lips or skin (cyanosis) in severe cases Chest pain Fainting Swelling in legs, abdomen, or face in severe cases Poor weight gain or feeding difficulties in infants Q. How is pulmonary stenosis diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is often made by hearing a heart murmur during a physical exam. Confirmatory tests include: Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to visualize the valve and measure the narrowing Electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess heart muscle strain Chest X-ray to evaluate heart size and lung blood flow Sometimes fetal echocardiogram before birth Cardiac catheterization in rare cases for detailed assessment or treatment Q. How is pulmonary stenosis treated? A. Mild cases may only require regular monitoring without treatment. Moderate to severe cases often need intervention, such as balloon valvuloplasty, a catheter-based procedure to widen the valve. Surgery is less common but may be needed if catheter treatment is not successful. Treatment improves symptoms and prevents complications like heart failure. Q. What is the outlook for children with pulmonary stenosis? A. With appropriate treatment, most children lead normal, active lives. Regular follow-up with a cardiologist is important to monitor heart function and valve status. Can pulmonary stenosis be prevented? Since it is usually a congenital condition with unknown cause, it cannot be prevented. Early diagnosis and treatment improve outcomes. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS Doctor: Hello, I’d like to talk with you about your child’s heart condition called pulmonary stenosis. Do you have any questions before we begin? Parent: Yes, doctor. What exactly is pulmonary stenosis? Doctor: Pulmonary stenosis is a congenital heart defect where the valve that controls blood flow from the right side of the heart to the lungs is narrower than normal. This narrowing makes it harder for blood to flow through, so the heart has to work harder to pump blood to the lungs. Parent: How do you diagnose this condition? Doctor: We start with a physical exam and listen for a heart murmur, which is often the first clue. Then, we perform an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart that lets us see the valve and measure how narrow it is. Sometimes, a chest X-ray or other imaging tests may be done to assess the heart and lungs. Parent: What symptoms should we expect? Doctor: Many children with mild pulmonary stenosis have no symptoms. In more severe cases, children might get tired easily, have shortness of breath, or even a bluish tint to their lips or skin. Infants might have feeding difficulties or poor growth. Parent: How is pulmonary stenosis treated? Doctor: Mild cases usually just need regular monitoring. For moderate to severe narrowing, we often perform a procedure called balloon valvuloplasty. This is done in the catheterization lab, where a small balloon is inserted and inflated to widen the valve. Surgery is less common but may be necessary if the catheter procedure isn’t successful. Parent: Is the balloon procedure safe? Doctor: Yes, it is generally safe and effective. It usually helps improve blood flow and symptoms with a relatively quick recovery time. Parent: What is the outlook for my child? Doctor: With appropriate treatment, most children do very well and can lead normal, active lives. We will continue to follow your child regularly to monitor heart function and valve status. Parent: Thank you, doctor. This helps me understand the condition and what to expect. Doctor: You’re welcome. Please feel free to ask any questions anytime, and we’ll support you and your child throughout the treatment. REFERENCES Pulmonary valve stenosis - Diagnosis & treatment - Mayo Clinic https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/157737-guidelines PULMONARY ATRRESIA DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF PULMONARY ATRRESIA Pulmonary atresia (uh-TREE-zhuh) is a heart problem present at birth. That means it is a congenital heart defect. In this condition, the valve that helps move blood from the heart to the lungs doesn\\'t form correctly. The valve is called the pulmonary valve. Instead of a valve that opens and closes, a solid sheet of tissue forms. So, blood can\\'t travel its usual path to get oxygen from the lungs. Instead, some blood travels to the lungs through other natural passages within the heart and its arteries. A baby in the womb needs these other passages. But they usually close soon after birth. Pulmonary atresia is a life-threatening condition that needs emergency treatment. Treatment includes surgery to repair the heart and medicines to help the heart work better. In addition to not having a normal pulmonary valve, a baby with pulmonary atresia may have: Lips, fingers, and toes that look blue because of a lack of oxygen in their blood. An underdeveloped right ventricle and tricuspid valve (the valve connecting the right atrium and right ventricle). An opening (the foramen ovale) between their heart’s right atrium and left atrium that may stay open instead of closing like it should after birth. This allows oxygen-poor blood to pass from the right atrium to the left atrium, where it flows through the left ventricle to the aorta. In babies with pulmonary valve atresia, there also may be a problem with a dividing wall in their heart. This wall normally helps blood go where it’s supposed to go. Your heart has four chambers, with a solid wall called the septum between your heart’s two sides. The right side sends blood to your lungs to get oxygen. The left side of your heart moves oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body through your aorta (the main artery in your heart). Pulmonary atresia types Pulmonary atresia with a ventricular septal defect. This opening in the wall (septum) between the right and left ventricles allows oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood. Pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum. The wall between the left and right sides of your heart is whole (intact). Who does pulmonary atresia affect? Genetic factors, such as an abnormal gene or chromosomal defect, may increase the chances of heart defects in certain families. Some children with genetic disorders like DiGeorge’s syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome may be at greater risk for pulmonary atresia. Yes. Pulmonary atresia occurs in about one out of 10,000 live births CAUSES OF PULMONARY ATRRESIA The cause of pulmonary atresia is not clear. During the first six weeks of pregnancy, the baby\\'s heart begins to form and starts beating. The major blood vessels that run to and from the heart also begin to develop during this critical time. It\\'s at this point in a baby\\'s development that a congenital heart defect such as pulmonary atresia may begin to develop. To understand how pulmonary atresia occurs, it may be helpful to know how the heart works. How the heart works The typical heart is made of four chambers. There are two upper chambers, called atria, and two lower chambers, called ventricles. The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs. In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns it to the heart\\'s left side. The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the body\\'s main artery, called the aorta. The blood goes to the rest of the body. In pulmonary atresia, the pulmonary valve doesn\\'t form as usual so it can\\'t open. Blood can\\'t flow from the right ventricle to the lungs. Before birth, not having a pulmonary valve opening doesn\\'t affect the baby\\'s oxygen. That\\'s because the baby gets oxygen from the tissue that connects the baby to the womb, called the placenta. The oxygen-rich blood from the placenta goes to the baby\\'s right upper heart chamber. The blood going into the right side of the baby\\'s heart then passes through a hole between the top chambers of the baby\\'s heart. The hole is called the foramen ovale. It lets oxygen-rich blood move to the rest of the baby\\'s body through the aorta. After birth, the lungs are needed for oxygen. In pulmonary atresia, without a working pulmonary valve, blood must find another way to reach the baby\\'s lungs. Blood from the right side of the heart can cross over the foramen ovale to the left heart. From there it can be pumped to the aorta. Newborn babies have a temporary opening called the ductus arteriosus between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. This opening lets some blood travel to the lungs. There the blood picks up oxygen to send to the rest of the baby\\'s body. The ductus arteriosus most often closes soon after birth. But medicines can keep it open. Sometimes there\\'s a second hole in the tissue between the main pumping chambers of the baby\\'s heart. This hole is a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The VSD lets blood flow from the right lower heart chamber to the left lower heart chamber. People with pulmonary atresia and a VSD often have other changes with the lungs and the arteries that bring blood to the lungs. If there\\'s no VSD, the right lower heart chamber gets little blood flow before birth. The chamber often doesn\\'t form fully. This is a condition called pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS). Risk factors OF PULMONARY ATRRESIA Pulmonary atresia happens as the baby\\'s heart is forming during pregnancy. Certain health conditions or illicit drug use during pregnancy may increase a baby\\'s risk of pulmonary atresia or other congenital heart defects. Risk factors include: Obesity. Alcohol or tobacco use. Diabetes. Use of some types of medicines during pregnancy, such as certain acne and blood pressure medicines. Some types of congenital heart defects occur in families. This means they are inherited. If you or someone in your family was born with a heart problem, including pulmonary atresia, ask your care team is genetic screening is right for you. Screening can help show the risk of certain congenital heart defects in future children. Symptoms OF PULMONARY ATRRESIA Symptoms of pulmonary atresia may be seen soon after birth. They can include: Blue or gray skin, lips or fingernails due to low oxygen levels. Depending on the skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see. Fast breathing or shortness of breath. Tiring easily. Not feeding well. When to see a doctor Pulmonary atresia is most often found soon after birth. If your baby has symptoms of pulmonary atresia after you\\'ve left the hospital, get medical help right away. Diagnosis OF PULMONARY ATRRESIA Pulmonary atresia is usually diagnosed soon after birth. Tests are done to check the baby\\'s heart health. Tests FOR PULMONARY ATRRESIA Tests to diagnose pulmonary atresia may include: Pulse oximetry. A sensor placed on the fingertip records the amount of oxygen in the blood. Too little oxygen may be a sign of a heart or lung problem. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray shows the size and shape of the heart and lungs. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick and painless test records the electrical activity of the heart. It shows how the heart is beating. Sticky patches called electrodes are put on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the patches to a computer, which prints or displays the results. Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the beating heart. An echocardiogram is usually the main test to diagnose pulmonary atresia. It shows how blood moves through the heart and heart valves. If an echocardiogram is done on a baby before birth, it\\'s called a fetal echocardiogram. Cardiac catheterization. A doctor threads a thin tube called a catheter through a blood vessel in the arm or groin to an artery in the heart. Dye is sent through the catheter. This makes the heart arteries show up more clearly on an X-ray. The test can provide detailed information on blood flow and how the heart works. Certain heart treatments can be done during cardiac catheterization. Treatment OF PULMONARY ATRRESIA Babies need emergency medical care for pulmonary atresia symptoms. The choice of surgeries or procedures depends on how severe the condition is. Medications FOR PULMONARY ATRRESIA Medicine may be given through an IV to keep the ductus arteriosus open. This is not a long-term treatment for pulmonary atresia. But it gives healthcare professionals more time to decide what type of surgery or procedure might be best. Surgery or other procedures Sometimes, pulmonary atresia treatment can be done using a long, thin tube called a catheter. A doctor places the tube into a large blood vessel in a baby\\'s groin and guides it to the heart. Catheter-based procedures for pulmonary atresia include: Balloon atrial septostomy. A balloon is used to enlarge the natural hole in the wall between the upper chambers of the heart. This hole, called the foramen ovale, most often closes soon after birth. Making the hole larger lets blood move easily from the right side of the heart to the left side. Stent placement. A doctor may put a rigid tube called a stent in the ductus arteriosus to prevent it from closing. This keeps blood flowing to the lungs. Babies with pulmonary atresia often need many heart surgeries over time. The type of heart surgery depends on the size of the child\\'s lower right heart chamber and pulmonary artery. Types of surgery for pulmonary atresia include: Shunting. This involves making a new route for blood to flow, called a bypass shunt. The shunt goes from the main blood vessel leading out of the heart, called the aorta, to the pulmonary arteries. This lets enough blood flow to the lungs. But most babies outgrow this shunt within a few months. Glenn procedure. In this surgery, one of the large veins that returns blood to the heart is joined to the pulmonary artery. Another large vein keeps blood flowing to the right side of the heart. The heart then pumps it through the pulmonary valve that\\'s been repaired. This can help the right ventricle grow. Fontan procedure. If the right lower heart chamber stays too small to do its work, surgeons may use this procedure to make a pathway. The pathway lets most, if not all, of the blood coming to the heart to flow into the pulmonary artery. Heart transplant. In some cases, the heart is too damaged to fix. Then a heart transplant may be needed. If the baby also has a ventricular septal defect (VSD), surgery is done to patch the hole. Then the surgeon makes a connection from the right pumping chamber to the pulmonary artery. This repair may use an artificial valve. Lifestyle and home remedies FOR PULMONARY ATRRESIA Here are some tips for caring for someone with pulmonary atresia after coming home from the hospital: Go to scheduled health checkups. A person born with pulmonary atresia needs regular checkups, even as an adult. A doctor trained in congenital heart diseases, called a congenital cardiologist, often provides care. Get recommended vaccines, including yearly flu vaccines. Ask about exercise and activity. Some children with a congenital heart defect may need to limit exercise or sports activities. However, many others with a congenital heart defect can participate in such activities. Your child\\'s care team can tell you which sports and types of exercise are safe for your child. Practice good oral hygiene. Brushing and flossing teeth and getting regular dental checkups can help prevent infection. Ask about preventive antibiotics. Sometimes, a congenital heart defect can increase the risk of infection in the lining of the heart or heart valves. This infection is called infective endocarditis. Antibiotics may be recommended before dental procedures to prevent infection, especially for people who have a mechanical heart valve. Complications OF PULMONARY ATRRESIA Without treatment, pulmonary atresia most often leads to death. After surgery for pulmonary atresia, babies need regular health checkups throughout their lives to watch for complications. Complications of pulmonary atresia may include: Bacterial infection of the inner lining of the heart and valves, called infectious endocarditis. Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. Weakening of heart function. Prevention OF PULMONARY ATRRESIA It might not be possible to prevent pulmonary atresia. But getting good prenatal care is important. Some things you can do before or during pregnancy might help lower your baby\\'s risk of congenital heart defects. They include: Control other health conditions. If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar in check. For other conditions that need medicines, talk to your healthcare professional about taking these medicines while pregnant. Don\\'t smoke and don\\'t be around others who smoke. If you smoke, quit. Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of a congenital heart defect in the baby. Aim for a healthy weight. Obesity increases the risk of having a baby with a congenital heart defect. Get recommended vaccinations. Having rubella, also called German measles, during pregnancy can cause problems in a baby\\'s heart development. A blood test done before pregnancy can determine if you\\'re immune to rubella. A vaccine is available for those who aren\\'t immune. Outlook / Prognosis OF PULMONARY ATRRESIA Complications of pulmonary atresia may include: Delays in growth. Abnormal heart rhythms. Heart failure. Liver disease. It is also very important to monitor for complications after surgical repair. Fontan circulation is not normal, so your child will need close lifelong follow up. Over time, people with Fontan circulation may develop signs of heart failure (difficulty breathing, fatigue, swelling in the belly and legs, poor exercise tolerance), liver dysfunction, and abnormal heart rhythms. Some people need a heart transplant. Is pulmonary atresia fatal? Without treatment, pulmonary atresia is fatal because it makes your oxygen level low. However, when your healthcare provider makes a diagnosis before or shortly after your baby’s birth, they can treat your newborn to improve their oxygen circulation. Your baby may need several surgeries at different ages to keep improving their situation. Outlook for pulmonary atresia Pulmonary atresia life expectancy varies depending on how severe your child’s condition is and other individual factors. Survival rates are better today than they were in previous decades. About 60% to 85% of people who have a Fontan procedure (the last in the surgical series) are alive 20 years later. However, many have long-term complications. Some say a person who had a Fontan procedure and is now 35 years old has as many years of life left as someone who is already 72. Survival rate of pulmonary atresia Without having surgery to fix pulmonary atresia with a ventricular septal defect, the survival rate is 50% at age 1 and 8% at 10 years of age. Most people don’t live into their 30s without surgery. Can pulmonary atresia be cured? No. Medical procedures and surgeries can improve your child’s condition, but they aren’t cures. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF PULMONARY ATRRESIA Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS) Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia Tricuspid atresia Critical pulmonary stenosis (severe narrowing of pulmonary valve, may mimic atresia) Severe pulmonary valve dysplasia or hypoplasia Ebstein anomaly (malformation of tricuspid valve causing cyanosis) Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) Other complex cyanotic congenital heart diseases causing right ventricular outflow obstruction or cyanosis Epidemiology of Pediatric Pulmonary Atresia: Pulmonary atresia is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by the absence or complete closure of the pulmonary valve, preventing blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs. The overall birth prevalence of pulmonary atresia is approximately 1 in 6,700 to 1 in 10,000 live births in the United States and other developed countries. Specifically, pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) occurs in about 0.042 per 1,000 live births (roughly 1 in 24,000), making it an unusual but recognized cardiac malformation. Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS) is even rarer, accounting for less than 1% of all congenital heart defects, with an estimated incidence of about 1 in 15,000 live births. Pulmonary atresia is classified into two main forms based on the presence or absence of a ventricular septal defect, which differ in clinical presentation, associated anomalies, and epidemiology. It is considered a critical congenital heart defect (critical CHD) because infants typically present with cyanosis shortly after birth due to lack of pulmonary blood flow. Some forms of pulmonary atresia, especially PA-VSD, are associated with genetic syndromes such as 22q11 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome). Pulmonary atresia accounts for a significant proportion of cyanotic congenital heart diseases and often requires early diagnosis and intervention. The condition can sometimes be detected prenatally via fetal echocardiography during the second trimester. GENOMIC DATA ON PULMONARY ATRRESIA Genomic Research: Rare Candidate Genes: Studies have identified novel candidate genes likely involved in PA pathogenesis, including DNAH10, DST, FAT1, HMCN1, HNRNPC, TEP1, and TYK2 . These genes are expressed in human pulmonary artery and embryonic heart tissues. Copy Number Variants (CNVs): Several rare CNVs have been implicated in PA-VSD, such as deletions at 16p11.2 (affecting PPP4C and TBX6), 5q35.3 (FLT4), and 5p13.1 (RICTOR), as well as duplications at 6p21.33 (TNXB), 7p15.2 (HNRNPA2B1), and 19p13.3 (FGF22) . These genes interact with known cardiac development genes and are expressed in embryonic hearts. Novel Rare Variants: A recent study identified 176 risk genes with rare variants in PA patients, including 18 rare variants in 11 new candidate genes potentially involved in PA pathogenesis . These findings expand the genetic landscape of PA. Single-Gene Mutations: Mutations in genes such as GJA5, GDF1, and MTHFR have been reported in PA patients, suggesting a cumulative effect of multiple genetic factors . Family Studies: Whole exome sequencing in familial cases has revealed mutations in the BMPR2 gene, which is involved in vascular development and signaling pathways related to heart formation. A novel heterozygous mutation c.2804C>T (p.A935V) in BMPR2 was identified in affected family members, linking it to PA. Genetic Syndromes: PA can be associated with genetic syndromes such as 22q11 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome), which involves multiple congenital anomalies including cardiac defects. PREDEFINED QUESTION AND ANSWERS ON PULMONARY ATRRESIA Q. What is pulmonary atresia in children? A. Pulmonary atresia is a rare congenital heart defect where the pulmonary valve, which controls blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs, is completely closed or absent. This prevents blood from reaching the lungs to get oxygen. Q. What causes pulmonary atresia? A. Pulmonary atresia occurs because the fetal heart does not develop normally during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy. Most cases have no known cause, though some congenital heart defects can run in families. Environmental and genetic factors may play a role. Q. What are the symptoms of pulmonary atresia? A. Symptoms usually appear shortly after birth or when the ductus arteriosus (a fetal blood vessel) closes. Common symptoms include: Bluish skin or lips (cyanosis) due to low oxygen Rapid or troubled breathing Trouble feeding or poor weight gain Fatigue or tiredness Heart murmur detected by a doctor Q. How is pulmonary atresia diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is made using: Pulse oximetry to measure oxygen levels Chest X-ray to assess heart and lung size Electrocardiogram (ECG) to check heart rhythm Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to visualize the valve and blood flow Cardiac catheterization for detailed imaging and sometimes treatment Fetal echocardiogram can diagnose the condition before birth Q. How is pulmonary atresia treated? A. Babies need emergency care after birth. Medications like prostaglandins keep the ductus arteriosus open to allow blood flow to the lungs temporarily. Procedures such as balloon atrial septostomy or stent placement in the ductus arteriosus may be done via catheter. Surgery is usually required, which may include shunts to direct blood flow to the lungs or more complex repairs depending on heart anatomy. Some children require multiple surgeries over time. In severe cases, heart transplantation may be considered. Q. What is the outlook for children with pulmonary atresia? A, With timely treatment and surgery, many children survive and can lead active lives, though ongoing cardiac care is essential. The prognosis depends on the severity of the defect and associated heart abnormalities. Q. Can pulmonary atresia be prevented? SiA. nce the exact cause is unknown and it is a congenital defect, it cannot be reliably prevented. However, good prenatal care, avoiding harmful substances during pregnancy, and managing maternal health conditions may reduce risk. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON PULMONARY ATRRESIA Doctor: Hello, I want to talk with you about your child’s diagnosis of pulmonary atresia. Do you have any questions before we start? Parent: Yes, doctor. What exactly is pulmonary atresia? Doctor: Pulmonary atresia is a serious congenital heart defect where the valve that allows blood to flow from the right side of the heart to the lungs didn’t form properly. The valve is completely closed, so blood can’t get to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Parent: That sounds very serious. How does this affect my child? Doctor: Because blood can’t flow normally to the lungs, your child’s body isn’t getting enough oxygen, which causes the bluish skin color we call cyanosis. Babies with this condition often have trouble breathing and feeding, and they can get very tired quickly. Parent: How is this treated? Doctor: Right after birth, we give medication called prostaglandin to keep a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus open. This vessel helps blood reach the lungs temporarily. Then, your child will need surgery or catheter-based procedures to create or improve blood flow to the lungs. The exact treatment depends on how well the right ventricle and pulmonary arteries have developed. Parent: What kind of surgeries will my child need? Doctor: There are a few surgical options. Sometimes, a shunt is placed to connect the aorta to the pulmonary arteries to increase blood flow to the lungs. In other cases, more complex repairs or staged surgeries like the Fontan procedure may be needed if the right ventricle is too small to pump effectively. Your child may need multiple surgeries as they grow. Parent: Will my child need lifelong care? Doctor: Yes, pulmonary atresia requires lifelong follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist and later an adult congenital heart disease specialist. Your child will need monitoring, possible additional interventions, and support for a healthy life. Parent: What can we expect in terms of recovery and quality of life? Doctor: With timely treatment, many children do well and can lead active lives. Recovery from surgery takes time, and your child will need special care after procedures, but advances in treatment have greatly improved outcomes. Parent: Is there anything I should watch for at home? Doctor: Yes. Watch for worsening breathing difficulty, poor feeding, increased fatigue, or changes in skin color. If you notice any of these, seek medical attention promptly. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything. It helps to understand what’s ahead. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’ll support you and your child every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to ask any questions as we go forward.

It’s usually caused by an injury, illness or surgery. While the condition itself is usually harmless, underlying causes can be serious. Pneumomediastinum is also called mediastinal emphysema. Types of pneumomediastinum Pneumomediastinum can either be spontaneous or secondary. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) isn’t caused by injury or illness, or the cause is unknown. Secondary pneumomediastinum develops because of an injury or illness. Pneumomediastinum is uncommon. Experts estimate that it affects 1 in 25,000 people between the ages of 5 and 34 (the group most affected by SPM). Spontaneous pneumomediastinum isn’t an emergency. But if you have air in your mediastinum due to an injury or illness, you should be treated right away. Go to the nearest emergency room or seek medical care immediately if you have chest pain and shortness of breath. These could be signs of life-threatening illnesses or conditions. Pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax Pneumothorax is a collapsed lung. It happens when there’s air between your lung and chest wall. The air pushes on your lung until it collapses under the pressure. Pneumomediastinum is air in the space between your lungs, in the center of your chest. This area is called your mediastinum. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of pneumomediastinum include: Severe pain in the middle of your chest or breastbone. It may radiate to your arms or neck. The pain may be worse with breathing or swallowing. Shortness of breath. Air pockets under your skin on your face, neck or chest (subcutaneous emphysema). Neck or face swelling. High-pitched voice or other voice distortion. Some people don’t have any symptoms. What causes pneumomediastinum? Pneumomediastinum is usually caused by air moving into your mediastinum from an injury to an internal organ or structure. This includes your airways (trachea or bronchi), air sacs in your lungs (alveoli), tube from your throat to your stomach (esophagus) or intestines. Anything that increases pressure in your chest can cause spontaneous pneumomediastinum, though this is rare. Sometimes, your provider can’t find the cause. Examples of pneumomediastinum causes Examples of specific causes of pneumomediastinum include: Severe injury (trauma) to your chest. Surgery. Rupture of the small sacs of your lungs (alveoli). Tear in your airways or gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Bacterial, fungal or viral infections. Excessive coughing, sneezing, vomiting and other body functions that increase pressure in your chest suddenly. Bearing down while going to the bathroom. Pushing during childbirth. Inhaling cocaine or marijuana. Scuba diving. Mechanical ventilation. Risk factors for pneumomediastinum You might be at higher risk for pneumomediastinum if you: Smoke. Have asthma, COPD or other lung conditions. Use inhaled recreational drugs. Recently had surgery on your abdomen, neck or chest. Recently gave birth. Complications of pneumomediastinum Some rare complications of pneumomediastinum are life-threatening and need to be treated right away. They include: Buildup of air might push on the area around your lungs, causing one to collapse (pneumothorax). Air may move from the mediastinum to the area between your heart and the sac around it (pneumopericardium). If too much air builds up, it can put pressure on structures in your chest, including your heart and blood vessels. They may not work properly if this happens. Diagnosis and Tests A healthcare provider diagnoses pneumomediastinum with a chest X-ray or CT scan. These are tests that take pictures of the inside of your chest. They’ll order them after listening to your heart and lungs. Hearing a crunching sound in time with your heartbeat (Hamman’s sign) is a sign that you might have air in your mediastinum. Management and Treatment There’s no specific treatment for pneumomediastinum. It’s usually not serious and your body will absorb the air on its own. Oxygen therapy can speed this up. If you have an underlying health condition, like an infection or injury to an internal organ, your provider will treat you for that condition. Treatments Your provider may admit you to the hospital for 24 hours or longer for observation or treatment. While there, they might treat you with: Oxygen therapy. Breathing in additional oxygen can help the air absorb into your body faster. Medication. Medication like pain relievers or cough suppressants can ease your symptoms until your body absorbs the extra air. Needle aspiration. If you have a lot of air that’s pressing on structures inside of your body, a provider may remove some with a needle or put a drain in. This is rare. Can pneumomediastinum be fatal? Pneumomediastinum isn’t fatal on its own. But sometimes, serious, life-threatening health conditions can cause it. Your provider will look for causes of the air and treat them if necessary. Outlook / Prognosis People with spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) spend an average of three days in the hospital but are sometimes there for a week or more. People with underlying causes of pneumomediastinum can be hospitalized for several weeks. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum usually goes away on its own without treatment. If it wasn’t caused by an underlying health condition, it shouldn’t come back. The health conditions that cause it can sometimes be cured. Your outlook will depend on what’s causing the air in your mediastinum. People with spontaneous pneumomediastinum can make a full recovery and rarely have it happen again. If you have secondary pneumomediastinum, recovery will depend on the severity of your underlying condition. Some conditions that cause pneumomediastinum can be fatal. Prevention Pneumomediastinum is rare and researchers don’t understand all the causes or risk factors. There aren’t any recommended ways to prevent it. Not smoking and not using inhaled recreational drugs might lower your risk. Living With See a healthcare provider if you’re experiencing discomfort in your chest, face swelling or unexpected changes in your voice, especially if you’ve recently had surgery or given birth. Seek medical attention or go to the nearest emergency room immediately if you’re experiencing: Chest pain. Shortness of breath. Severe face or neck swelling. Lightheadedness.

Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is uncommon. Based on previous studies, a review by Chalumeau et al determined a prevalence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum ranging from 1 per 800 to 1 per 42,000 pediatric patients presenting to a hospital emergency department. Stack et al reported a 0.3% incidence of pneumomediastinum in association with asthma presenting to their institution over a 10-year period. The mean age of affected patients was 11 years. No sex differences were observed in this cohort. Another study by Vianello et al that included 45 patients with severe acute asthma exacerbation found that 11.1% (5 patients) were diagnosed with pneumomediastinum. A study reported the frequency of extra-abdominal gas in a series of patients undergoing laparoscopic esophageal surgery. Forty-seven percent of patients (N = 45) had evidence of extra-abdominal air on chest radiography. Of these, 86% had a pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum persisted at least 1 postoperative day in two thirds of these cases. However, no mortality or morbidity was attributable to the presence of pneumomediastinum. In a series of patients with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), air leaks of any type, excluding pneumothorax, occurred in 3.7% of patients. Ventilator pressures and volumes delivered were not correlated with the development of air leak. In a series of adult patients presenting with blunt chest trauma, as many as 10% had evidence of pneumomediastinum. A study by Muckart et al that included 389 patients with blunt thoracic trauma reported a minimal incidence (5.9% for pneumomediastinum) of pneumomediastinum or pneumopericardium following blunt thoracic trauma. International statistics A study by Briassoulis et al from Greece, evaluating the frequency of air leaks in children receiving mechanical ventilation, reported a prevalence of 27%. However, they did not report the prevalence of specific types of air leak. Esayag et al reported an Israeli series of 13 patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum. This group represented 1 in 41,600 referrals to the emergency room and 1 in 15,500 hospitalizations. The median age of the patients was 19 years (range 2-72 y). Males comprised 77% of this group. A case series from Taiwan reported by Lee et al defined an incidence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum in children of 1:8,302 patient visits to the pediatric emergency department. They observed a bimodal distribution, with cases occurring in children younger than 4 years old and in adolescents aged 15-18 years. Males outnumbered females by a ratio of 4:1. Sex- and age-related demographics In a series of pneumomediastinum occurring in persons with asthma, there was a very slight male predominance in the prevalence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Other series confirm this excess of male cases. Damore and Dayan reported 29 cases of pneumomediastinum over a 10-year period unrelated to trauma, intubation, or surgical procedures; 69% of patients were male. Traumatic pneumomediastinum is more common in males, reflecting the male predominance among those who experience trauma and accidents. Some have suggested that a body habitus favoring a tall thin build is an additional risk factor for the development of spontaneous pneumomediastinum. The mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. The peak prevalence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum is seen in the second to fourth decades of life. This presumably reflects involvement in activities that increase the risk for developing pneumomediastinum, such as diving or marked physical exertion (eg, athletic activities, weight lifting). Moreover, the force of an individual\\'s cough, vomit, and Valsalva maneuvers (all of which may lead to pneumomediastinum) attenuates with age, accounting for the decline in the prevalence of pneumomediastinum with age. The age distribution for pneumomediastinum occurring in conjunction with specific disease processes reflects the age profile of the particular disease. Procedures Diagnostic or therapeutic procedures are generally not necessary. Placement of a chest tube should not be attempted unless an accompanying symptomatic pneumothorax is present. Bronchoscopy is indicated if a tracheobronchial perforation is suspected, which may occasionally be observed following blunt chest trauma. Neal et al observed that pneumomediastinum after blunt trauma in clinically stable children is rarely associated with significant underlying injury to the tracheobronchial tree. In addition to trauma indications, bronchoscopy may assist with localization and removal of foreign bodies as well as the evaluation of endobronchial lesions that may occur in association with pneumomediastinum. Haam et al reported a series in which all patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum undergoing contrast studies of the esophagus or esophagoscopy had normal studies. These authors suggest that these studies are indicated only if an esophageal perforation is suspected or signs of mediastinitis are present. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q. What is pneumomediastinum? A, Pneumomediastinum is a condition where air is present in the mediastinum, the central space in the chest between the lungs. It can occur spontaneously or due to trauma, medical procedures, or underlying lung or esophageal problems. Q. What causes pneumomediastinum? A. Common causes include blunt or penetrating chest trauma, asthma exacerbations, severe coughing or vomiting, mechanical ventilation, esophageal rupture, and certain infections. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum occurs without an obvious cause, often in young adults or children after activities that increase intrathoracic pressure. Q. What are the symptoms of pneumomediastinum? A. Symptoms may include sudden severe chest pain beneath the breastbone that can radiate to the neck or arms, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, throat or jaw pain, voice changes, neck swelling, and sometimes subcutaneous emphysema (air under the skin causing swelling or crackling sensation). Q. How is pneumomediastinum diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is primarily made by chest X-ray or CT scan showing air in the mediastinum. Physical exam may reveal subcutaneous emphysema or a characteristic crunching sound over the chest called Hamman’s sign. Additional tests may be done to rule out esophageal perforation or other causes. Q. How is pneumomediastinum treated? A. Most cases resolve on their own without treatment. Supportive care includes rest, oxygen therapy to help absorb the air faster, and pain management. If pneumomediastinum is caused by trauma or esophageal rupture, more urgent interventions like surgery or chest tube placement may be necessary. Q. What is the prognosis? A. The outlook depends on the underlying cause. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum usually resolves completely without complications. Secondary pneumomediastinum related to trauma or esophageal injury may have more serious outcomes and require prompt treatment. Q. When should I seek medical care? Seek immediate medical attention if you experience sudden chest pain, difficulty breathing, or swelling in the neck or chest, especially after trauma or invasive procedures DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON pneumomediastinum Doctor: Hello, I want to discuss your recent diagnosis of pneumomediastinum. Do you have any questions before we begin? Patient: Yes, doctor. What exactly is pneumomediastinum? Doctor: Pneumomediastinum means there is air trapped in the mediastinum, which is the central space in your chest between the lungs. This can happen spontaneously or due to injury or other causes. Patient: How did this happen to me? Doctor: In your case, it appears to be spontaneous, meaning it occurred without trauma or medical procedures. It can happen after activities that increase pressure in the chest, like severe coughing, vomiting, or asthma attacks. Patient: What symptoms should I expect? Doctor: Common symptoms include sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, neck pain or swelling, and sometimes a crackling sensation under the skin called subcutaneous emphysema. Some people also notice a crunching sound in sync with their heartbeat, called Hamman’s sign. Patient: Is this dangerous? What treatment do I need? Doctor: Most spontaneous cases are not serious and tend to resolve on their own. Treatment mainly involves rest, oxygen therapy to help absorb the air faster, and pain relief. We will monitor you closely to ensure no complications develop. Patient: How long will it take to get better? Doctor: Usually, symptoms improve within a few days to a week. We’ll do follow-up imaging to confirm the air has been absorbed. Patient: When should I seek urgent care? Doctor: If you experience worsening chest pain, difficulty breathing, swelling in your neck or face, or fever, please seek medical attention immediately, as these could indicate complications or other serious conditions. Patient: Thank you, doctor. This helps me understand what’s going on. Doctor: You’re welcome. Feel free to ask any questions anytime, and we’ll support you throughout your recovery.

The baby is usually less than a year old and seems to be healthy. It often happens during sleep. Sudden infant death syndrome also is known as SIDS. It is sometimes called crib death because infants often die in their cribs. The cause of SIDS is unknown. But it may be caused by problems in the area of an infant\\'s brain that controls breathing and waking up from sleep. Researchers have found some things that might put babies at higher risk. They\\'ve also found some things you can do to help protect your child from SIDS. The most important action may be to place a baby on the back to sleep. Causes OF SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME Both physical and sleep factors put an infant at risk of SIDS. These factors vary from child to child. Physical factors Physical factors associated with SIDS include: Brain defects. Some infants are born with problems that make them more likely to die of SIDS. In many of these babies, the part of the brain that controls breathing and waking up from sleep hasn\\'t developed enough to work properly. Low birth weight. Being born early or being part of a multiple birth increases the chances that a baby\\'s brain hasn\\'t fully developed at birth. The baby may have less control over such automatic processes as breathing and heart rate. Respiratory infection. Many infants who died of SIDS had recently had a cold. A cold may lead to breathing problems. Sleep factors A baby\\'s sleeping position, items in the crib and other conditions may increase the risk of SIDS. Examples include: Sleeping on the stomach or side. Babies placed in these positions to sleep might have more trouble breathing than those placed on their backs. Sleeping on a soft surface. Lying face down on a fluffy comforter, a soft mattress or a waterbed can block an infant\\'s airway. Sharing a bed. The risk of SIDS rises if a baby sleeps in the same bed with parents, siblings or pets. But it may help if the infant sleeps in a separate bed in the same room with parents. That seems to lower the risk of SIDS. Overheating. Being too warm while sleeping can increase a baby\\'s risk of SIDS. Risk factors OF SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME SIDS can happen to any infant. But researchers have found several factors that might raise the risk. They include: Sex. Boys are slightly more likely than girls to die of SIDS. Age. Infants are at higher risk between the second and fourth months of life. Race. For reasons that aren\\'t well understood, SIDS occurs more often in Black, Native American and Alaska Native infants. Family history. Babies with siblings who died of SIDS are at higher risk of SIDS. Secondhand smoke. Babies who live with smokers have a higher risk of SIDS. Premature birth. Being born early and having a low birth weight increase a baby\\'s chances of SIDS. Risk factors in mothers During pregnancy, mothers also affect their babies\\' risk of SIDS, especially if they: Are younger than 20. Smoke cigarettes. Use drugs or alcohol. Do not receive good medical care while pregnant. Prevention OF SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME There\\'s no definite way to prevent SIDS. But you can help your baby sleep more safely by following these tips: Back to sleep. Place your baby to sleep in the correct position — on the back. Be sure to use the back position every time you or anyone else puts your baby to sleep for the first year of life. Don\\'t trust that others will place your baby to sleep in the correct position: Insist on it. This won\\'t be needed once your baby can roll over both ways without help. Don\\'t put your baby on the stomach or side to sleep. Advise a caregiver to only use the stomach position when the baby and caregiver are both in the same room and both are awake. Short periods of \"tummy time\" help a baby build muscle strength. But the baby should never be left alone during tummy time. Keep the crib as bare as possible. Use a firm, flat mattress. Make sure the mattress does not sit at an angle higher than 10 degrees. Avoid placing your baby on thick, fluffy padding, such as lambskin or a thick quilt. Don\\'t leave pillows, fluffy toys or stuffed animals in the crib. They can cause problems with breathing if your baby\\'s face presses against them. Don\\'t overheat your baby. To keep your baby warm, try a sleep sack. Or dress your baby in layers instead of using blankets. Don\\'t cover your baby\\'s head. Have your baby sleep in your room. If possible, your baby should sleep in your room with you, but not in the same bed. Have your baby sleep alone in a crib or bassinet with a mattress designed for infant bedding. Your baby should sleep in the same room with you for at least six months. Adult beds aren\\'t safe for infants. A baby can become trapped and suffocate between the headboard slats. Those are the spaces between the mattress and the bed frame. A baby also can get trapped in the space between the mattress and the wall. And a baby can suffocate if a sleeping parent accidentally rolls over and covers the baby\\'s nose and mouth. Breastfeed your baby, if possible. Breastfeeding for at least six months to a year lowers the risk of SIDS. Don\\'t use baby monitors and other commercial devices that claim to reduce the risk of SIDS. The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages the use of monitors and other devices. These devices do not prevent SIDS. And they cannot be used instead of safe sleep practices. Offer a pacifier. Sucking on a pacifier at nap time or bedtime may reduce the risk of SIDS. Make sure the pacifier does not have a strap or cord. If you\\'re breastfeeding, wait to offer a pacifier until you and your baby have settled into a nursing routine. It usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to set up a nursing routine. If your baby is not interested in the pacifier, don\\'t force it. Try again another day. If the pacifier falls out while your baby is sleeping, don\\'t put it back in. Vaccinate your baby. There\\'s no evidence that recommended shots to protect against diseases increase the risk of SIDS. Some evidence shows that such shots may help prevent SIDS. Treatment There\\'s no treatment for SIDS. But your baby\\'s pediatrician or other health care professional can talk with you about any risks your baby may have. And there are ways to help your baby sleep safely. For the first year, always place your baby to sleep on the back. Use a firm, flat mattress and avoid fluffy pads and blankets. Remove all toys and stuffed animals from the crib. Try using a pacifier. Don\\'t cover your baby\\'s head, and make sure your baby doesn\\'t get too hot. Your baby can sleep in your room, but not in your bed. Breastfeeding for at least six months to a year lowers the risk of SIDS. Vaccine shots to protect your baby from diseases also may help prevent SIDS. Diagnostic Considerations OF SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME A clinician untrained in forensic medicine may inadvertently overlook or destroy gross or trace evidence. Furthermore, misinterpretation of physical injuries or other objective evidence may lead to an inaccurate opinion that, if documented on the chart, may pose considerable problems when used in future court proceedings. Tragic consequences can follow the misattribution of an infant’s death. One example is that of a young African American couple who were criminally charged after a medical examiner indicated that their baby had died of abandonment—even though autopsy findings were consistent with SIDS and there were no signs of abuse or neglect. The couple spent 6 months in jail because they were unable to post bond before the charges were dismissed. Similarly egregious examples may be found at the other end of the spectrum, as illustrated by the case of Mary Beth Tining. Only when Tining was charged with the smothering death of her adopted daughter was it discovered that 8 of her biologic children had died, their deaths having been attributed to SIDS or other natural causes. A similar case is that of Waneta Hoyt, who was convicted in 1995 of murdering her 5 children between 1965 and 1971, all of whom were described as having succumbed to SIDS. In addition to the conditions listed in the differential diagnosis, other problems to be considered include the following: Aberrant thermoregulation Brain stem tumor Cardiac dysrhythmias Chiari malformation type I Choanal atresia/stenosis Central nervous system immaturity Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome Congenital heart disease Craniofacial abnormalities Disorders of cardiorespiratory control Drowning Drug exposure Fluid and electrolyte imbalance Gastroesophageal reflux Heat injury Hemangioma Lymphangioma Laryngomalacia Mast cell activation Neuromuscular disorders Occult trauma Pharyngeal/retropharyngeal mass Poisoning Respiratory syncytial virus infection Seizures Shaken infant impact syndrome or nonaccidental trauma Suffocation Toxin exposure Tracheobronchial or esophageal foreign bodies Tracheoesophageal fistula Tracheomalacia Upper airway obstruction Vascular malformation Vascular ring Vocal cord paralysis Differential Diagnoses OF SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME Abdominal Trauma, Blunt Acute Anemia Alcohol Toxicity Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery Aspiration Syndromes Bronchiolitis CBRNE - Botulism Carbon Monoxide Toxicity Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Child Abuse Child Abuse and Neglect Chronic Anemia Coarctation of the Aorta Coronary Artery Anomalies Emergent Management of Pediatric Patients with Fever Epiglottitis Head Trauma Hemorrhagic Shock Management in the ED Hypocalcemia Hyponatremia in Emergency Medicine Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome Hypothermia Hypovolemic Shock Intestinal Volvulus Long QT Syndrome Long-Chain Acyl CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency Meningitis, Bacterial Meningococcal Infections Myocardial Infarction in Childhood Myocarditis Myocarditis, Viral Pediatric Dehydration Pediatric Pneumonia Pediatric Status Epilepticus Pediatrics, Hypoglycemia Pediatrics, Inborn Errors of Metabolism Pediatrics, Meningitis and Encephalitis Pediatrics, Pertussis Septic Shock Shock, Cardiogenic Sleep Apnea Ventricular Fibrillation Epidemiology OF SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME United States statistics In spring 1992, a multiagency statement directed by officials at the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) was issued, informing health care providers and the general public that a supine sleep position could significantly reduce SIDS. In spring 1994, this was followed by the federal “Back to Sleep” campaign (see the image below), sponsored by the NICHD, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the Association of SIDS and Infant Mortality Programs (ASIP), the SIDS Alliance, and the United States Public Health Service. After the “Back to Sleep” campaign, federal SIDS researchers carried out annual surveys to examine how infant sleep practices and SIDS rates have changed. These studies, conducted by NICHD, demonstrated that the rate of prone sleeping for infants decreased from approximately 75% in 1992 to a low of 11.3% in 2002. The observation that the rate of prone sleeping increased to 14.5% in 2008 is of some concern. Since 1992, SIDS rates have fallen by approximately 58% in the United States (see the image below). In 1992, the incidence of SIDS was 1.2 cases per 1000 live births; in 2004, the incidence had dropped to 0.51. In 2004, 2246 deaths were certified as SIDS, accounting for 8% of infant deaths. In 2006, the National Center for Health Statistics reported a total of 2323 SIDS deaths nationwide, for an incidence of 0.54 per 1000 live births Simultaneously with this decrease in SIDS, post neonatal mortalities associated with several other causes of sudden unexpected death have increased significantly, particularly since 1999.It is postulated that some deaths previously classified as SIDS are now being more correctly categorized and that the true SIDS rate since 1999 may be static. A survey of medical examiners and coroners in 6 jurisdictions found that most used to certify many more deaths as SIDS than they do now. Although cases of true SIDS are decreasing, concern exists that the proportion of unexplained infant deaths resulting from child abuse may be increasing. Notably, the AAP estimates that the incidence of infanticide among cases designated as SIDS ranges from less than 1% to 5%. International statistics Significant reductions in the prevalence of SIDS have been observed worldwide, though rates of decline have leveled off in the past few years. These changes followed public health campaigns that emphasized the use of the supine sleep position as a simple means of lowering the risk of SIDS. These campaigns began in overseas centers in the late 1980s. In many Asian countries, the current incidence of SIDS is 0.04 per 1000 live births. Japan has a rate of 0.09/1000, and Hong Kong has a rate of approximately 0.2/1000. Some Scandinavian countries have rates in the range of 0.1-0.06/1000. In Italy, the incidence is 0.7/1000. Before the recommendation of the supine sleeping position, the incidence of SIDS United Kingdom was 3.5/1000; this figure is now 0.41/1000. The incidence in New Zealand was once approximately 4.5/1000 but is now 0.8/1000. In many of these countries, rates of prone sleeping have fallen to 2-5%. As an illustration of the impact of this single factor, Dwyer et al estimated that 70% of the overall decline in SIDS rates could be attributed to a change to the supine sleep position. They further noted that of 38 additional infant care variables studied, no other individual factor explained more than 7% of the overall decline in SIDS. With a change to supine sleep for infants, cigarette smoke exposure has emerged as one of the most important potentially modifiable risk factors for SIDS. Infants of mothers who smoke have a 2-fold to 5-fold higher risk of SIDS, and postnatal smoking by one or both parents has been identified as an independent SIDS risk factor.Despite emphasis within “Back to Sleep” campaigns on avoidance of cigarette smoke exposure (prenatal and postnatal), rates of maternal smoking during pregnancy have changed little in most countries. Other infant care practices have been found capable of modifying the risk of SIDS, as follows: Bed-sharing may lead to compromise of an infant’s airway, especially before the age of 3-4 months; sharing a couch or sofa is associated with an unusually high risk for SIDS and should be avoided Room-sharing reduces SIDS risk by 50% The effect of breastfeeding on SIDS risk varies; in a German infant cohort, breastfeeding reduced the risk of SIDS by approximately 50% at all ages throughout infancy Pacifier (dummy) use may reduce the risk of SIDS Over bundling of infants during sleep should be avoided; this advice appears to be more important for prone-sleeping infants than for supine-sleeping infants Covering the infant’s head with bedding or bed clothing is a risk factor for SID ; it is estimated that avoidance of head covering could reduce SIDS deaths by more than one quarter After \"Back to Sleep\" initiatives in Germany, Vennemann et al reexamined SIDS risk factors and noted that although only 4.1% of infants slept prone, those infants were at high risk for SIDS. Infants unaccustomed to sleeping prone were at very high risk, as were those who turned to prone. Bed-sharing, duvets, sleeping prone on a sheepskin, sleeping in the house of a friend or a relative, and sleeping in the living room increased the risk of SIDS. Pacifier use during sleep continued to be associated with a significantly reduced risk of SIDS. Age-related demographics About two-thirds of SIDS deaths occur in infants aged 2-4 months. Ninety percent of deaths occur in children younger than 6 months, and 95% of deaths occur in children younger than 8 months; few occur in children younger than 1 month or older than 8 months. This age-at-death profile suggests a relation to neurobiological components of infant development (see Pathophysiology). Slightly higher proportions of SIDS-certified deaths occurring in the neonatal period and after 6 months were reported in 2001 than were reported in 1992. Sex-related demographics Approximately 60-70% of SIDS deaths occur in males. Despite other notable changes in SIDS epidemiology, the male-to-female ratio has remained relatively unchanged in most population studies. Race-related demographics Risk among racial and ethnic groups in the United States varies substantially. In 2003, SIDS rates were highest for American Indian/Alaskan Native and non-Hispanic Black mothers—2.5 and 2.2 times higher, respectively, than the rate for non-Hispanic white mothers. African Americans are twice as likely to place infants prone for sleep, and they are also twice as likely to bed-share than other racial groups are. In contrasted, the SIDS rate for Mexican mothers was 51% lower than the rate for non-Hispanic white mothers, and the SIDS rate for Central American and South American mothers was 62% lower. The following data have been reported for the incidence of SIDS in various racial and ethnic groups (as number of cases per 1000 live births): Central Americans and South Americans - 0.20 Asian/Pacific Islanders - 0.28 Mexicans - 0.24 Puerto Ricans - 0.53 Whites - 0.51 African Americans - 1.08 American Indian - 1.24 These variations remain unexplained but appear to be independent of other risk factors, such as low birth weight, young maternal age, or high parity. They appear to mirror those observed for infant mortality in general. GUIDLINES OF SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME AAP recommends a safe sleep environment that can reduce the risk of all sleep-related infant deaths. Recommendations for a safe sleep environment include supine positioning, the use of a firm sleep surface, room-sharing without bed-sharing, and the avoidance of soft bedding and overheating. Additional recommendations for SIDS reduction include the avoidance of exposure to smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs; breastfeeding; routine immunization; and use of a pacifier. New evidence is presented for skin-to-skin care for newborn infants, use of bedside and in-bed sleepers, sleeping on couches/armchairs and in sitting devices, and use of soft bedding after 4 months of age. Offer a pacifier at nap time and at bedtime. Studies show these can reduce the risk for SIDS. Infants should be immunized in accordance with AAP and CDC recommendations. Provide supervised, awake tummy time daily to facilitate development. Remove infants from car seats, strollers, swings, infant carriers, and infant slings, if they fall asleep in them, to reduce the risk for gastroesophageal reflux and positional plagiocephaly. Do not use home cardiorespiratory monitors as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS. unexplained sudden death occurring in a child younger than 1 year with negative pathological and toxicological assessment be called “sudden unexplained death in infancy” (SUDI). Additional recommendations are summarized below. Evaluation Personal/family history and circumstances of the sudden death, along with blood and/or tissue for molecular autopsy should be collected in all cases of SUDI (Class I) An arrhythmia syndrome focused molecular autopsy/postmortem genetic testing can be useful (Class IIa) Considered assessment by an expert cardiac pathologist to rule out the presence of microscopic indicators of structural heart when a diagnosis of SUDI is made at autopsy. (Class IIb) Follow-up Screening of First-degree relatives First-degree relatives should undergo genetic testing whenever a pathogenic mutation in a gene associated with increased risk of sudden death is identified by molecular autopsy. Obligate carriers should be prioritized. First-degree relatives with a family history of inherited heart disease should be evaluated with resting ECG and exercise stress testing. Additional tests as indicated can be useful. Those with a history of arrhythmias or syncope should be prioritized. (Class IIa) Follow-up clinical assessment in young family members with a family history of inherited heart disease or other sudden unexplained death syndrome (SUDS) or SUDI death who may manifest symptoms and/or signs of the disease at an older age and in all family members whenever additional SUDS or SUDI events occur. (Class IIa) Consider evaluation of first-degree relatives with resting ECG and exercise stress testing. (Class IIb) The death of an infant may be attributed to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) when all of the following are true: A complete autopsy is performed, including cranium and cranial contents, and autopsy findings are compatible with SIDS No gross or microscopic evidence of trauma or significant disease process is present No evidence of trauma exists on skeletal survey Other causes of death are adequately ruled out, including meningitis, sepsis, aspiration, pneumonia, myocarditis, abdominal trauma, dehydration, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, significant congenital lesions, inborn metabolic disorders, carbon monoxide asphyxia, drowning, and burns No evidence of current alcohol, drug, or toxic exposure is present Thorough death scene investigation and review of the clinical history are negative Circumstances could indicate the possibility of intentional suffocation include: Recurrent cyanosis, apnea, or ALTEs occurring only while in the care of the same person; Age at death older than 6 months; Previous unexpected or unexplained deaths of 1 or more siblings; Simultaneous or nearly simultaneous death of twins Previous death of infants under the care of the same unrelated person Evidence of previous pulmonary hemorrhage (such as marked siderophages in the lung). marked change in muscle tone (hyper- or hypotonia); or altered responsiveness. The guidelines also add that a BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after completion of a thorough history and physical examination. Infants younger than 1 year who present with a BRUE are categorized either as (1) a lower-risk patient on the basis of history and physical examination for whom evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and management are offered or, (2) a higher-risk patient whose history and physical examination suggest the need for further investigation and treatment but for whom recommendations are not offered. This clinical practice guideline is structured to promote a patient- and family-centered approach to care, reduce unnecessary and potentially costly medical interventions, improve patient outcomes, and enhance efforts at future research. The form contains 25 questions that medical examiners and coroners should ask before beginning an autopsy. The following information is collected on the SUIDIRF: Investigation data. Witness interview. Infant’s medical history. Infant’s dietary history. Pregnancy history. Incident scene investigation. Investigation summary. Investigation diagrams. Summary for pathologist. Prevention Since 1996, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has recommended infants be placed in the supine position for sleep. In 2011, the AAP issued a policy statement expanding its recommendations to ensure a safe sleeping environment for infants and to further reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Other key recommendations are: Breastfeeding is recommended Always use a firm sleep surface. Car seats and other sitting devices are not recommended for routine sleep. The baby should sleep in the same room as the parents, but not in the same bed (room sharing without bed sharing). Keep soft objects or loose bedding out of the crib. Wedges and positioners should not be used. Offer a pacifier at nap time and bedtime. Avoid covering the infant\\'s head or overheating. Do not use home monitors or commercial devices marketed to reduce the risk for SIDS. Supervised, awake tummy time is recommended daily to facilitate development and minimize the occurrence of positional plagiocephaly (flat heads). Avoid alcohol, illicit drug use and smoke exposure during pregnancy and after birth Infants should be immunized in accordance with recommendations of the AAP and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME Q. What is SIDS? A. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden, unexpected death of an infant under 1 year of age that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history. Q. What causes SIDS? A. The exact cause of SIDS is unknown. It likely results from multiple factors including brain abnormalities affecting breathing and arousal, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors such as unsafe sleep environments. Q. Who is at risk for SIDS? A. Risk factors include: Infants aged 1 to 4 months (peak risk) Male infants slightly more than females Premature or low birth weight babies Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy or after birth Sleeping on stomach or side instead of back Sleeping on soft surfaces or with loose bedding Overheating during sleep Bed sharing with adults or siblings Q. How can SIDS be prevented? A. Prevention strategies include: Always placing babies to sleep on their backs Using a firm sleep surface without soft bedding or toys Avoiding bed-sharing and overheating Keeping the sleep environment smoke-free Offering a pacifier at nap time and bedtime (once breastfeeding is established) Ensuring regular prenatal care and avoiding smoking during pregnancy Q. What are the signs or symptoms before SIDS? A. Most infants do not show any warning signs before SIDS. It is usually a sudden, unexpected event during sleep. What should parents do if they find their baby unresponsive? Call emergency services immediately and start infant CPR if trained. Early intervention may be life-saving in other critical conditions mimicking SIDS. Q. Is SIDS hereditary? A. SIDS is generally not considered hereditary, but some genetic factors may contribute to susceptibility. What happens after a SIDS diagnosis? A thorough medical and forensic investigation is done. Support and counseling are offered to grieving families. Families may be referred to support groups and mental health resources. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME Doctor: I’m very sorry for your loss. I want to talk with you about what happened with your baby and explain what Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS, means. Do you have any questions before we start? Parent: Thank you, doctor. I don’t really understand what SIDS is. Why did this happen? Doctor: SIDS is the sudden and unexpected death of an otherwise healthy baby under one year of age, and even after a thorough examination, including an autopsy and investigation of the death scene, we cannot find a clear cause. It is very distressing because it happens without warning. Parent: Is there something I did wrong? Could it have been prevented? Doctor: It’s important to know that SIDS is not caused by anything you did or didn’t do. However, certain factors increase the risk, like babies sleeping on their stomachs or soft bedding, exposure to smoke, or overheating. That’s why safe sleep practices are strongly recommended—to reduce the risk as much as possible. Parent: What do you mean by safe sleep? Doctor: Safe sleep means putting your baby on their back to sleep, using a firm mattress without pillows or toys in the crib, keeping the room at a comfortable temperature, and avoiding smoking around your baby. Breastfeeding and using a pacifier during sleep can also reduce the risk. Parent: Will this happen again if I have another baby? Doctor: The risk for SIDS is low in future babies, but it’s natural to feel anxious. We encourage following safe sleep guidelines and regular pediatric care. There are also support groups for families who have experienced this loss. Parent: What should I look out for? Are there any signs before this happens? Doctor: Unfortunately, most babies who die from SIDS don’t show warning signs. That’s why prevention through safe sleeping environments is so important. Parent: Is there anything more we can do medically? Doctor: At this time, there is no treatment to prevent SIDS because its exact cause is unknown. Our focus is on education, prevention, and supporting families through this difficult time. Parent: Thank you for explaining. This is very hard to understand, but I appreciate your help. Doctor: I know this is an incredibly tough time. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or need support. We’re here for you.

Transient means it is short lived (usually less than 24 hours) and tachypnea means rapid breathing. CAUSES OF Transient tachypnea of the newborn Before babies are born, they have fluid in their lungs. Babies reabsorb some of that fluid because of hormone changes that happen before birth. More fluid gets reabsorbed as they pass through the birth canal during delivery. The rest of the fluid is absorbed into the lungs after they are born and start breathing on their own. If the fluid isn\\'t absorbed fast enough or if they have too much fluid in the lungs, they can\\'t take in oxygen very well. Babies with this problem have to breathe faster and harder to get enough oxygen into the lungs. RISK FACTOR OF Transient tachypnea of the newborn Only a small number of all newborn babies get this breathing problem. Although premature babies can have it, most babies with this problem are full-term. Babies delivered by C-section (without labor) are more likely to have this condition. This is because without the hormone changes of labor the fluid in the lungs is still there. The baby has to work to reabsorb it after birth. Babies of moms with asthma and diabetes may also be more likely to have this condition. Symptoms OF Transient tachypnea of the newborn Newborns with TTN have respiratory problems soon after birth (within one to two hours). These usually consist of some combination of rapid, noisy breathing (grunting) and/or the use of extra muscles to breathe (flaring nostrils or movements between the ribs or breastbone known as retractions). Diagnosis OF Transient tachypnea of the newborn The mother’s pregnancy and labor history are important to make the diagnosis. A chest X-ray may be taken to eliminate other causes of respiratory problems. A blood count and blood culture may be drawn to try to rule out infection. TTN is usually diagnosed after monitoring your baby for one to two days. Treatment OF Transient tachypnea of the newborn Your baby will be given oxygen as needed to maintain an adequate blood oxygen level. Pulse oximeter and/or blood gases may be used. Your baby’s oxygen requirement will usually be highest within a few hours after birth and then begin to decrease. Most infants with TTN improve in 12 to 24 hours. If your baby is breathing very rapidly, feedings may be withheld, and intravenous fluids may be given for nutrition until he or she improves. Your baby may also receive antibiotics during this time until infection is ruled out. Rarely, babies with TTN may have persistent lung problems for as long as one week. Prognosis TTN usually resolves completely within 24 hours after delivery. Babies who have had TTN usually have no further problems from it and require no special care or follow-up other than their routine pediatrician visits. Diagnostic Considerations Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is important not to assume that respiratory distress is solely transient tachypnea of the newborn and to consider other severe etiologies such as congenital cyanotic heart disease. Quickly assuming a diagnosis of transient tachypnea of the newborn limits the evaluation of the infant, potentially resulting in misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy. Further investigation should be performed with infants whose conditions are not improving or who are having worsening respiratory distress, particularly when incubator support is needed. Other conditions to consider In addition to the differentials list below, other conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis include the following: Hyperventilation Congenital heart disease Congenital malformations Metabolic disorders Pulmonary edema Pneumonia Aspiration Air leaks Differential Diagnoses OF Transient tachypnea of the newborn Congenital Pneumonia Meconium Aspiration Syndrome Metabolic Acidosis Neonatal Sepsis Pediatric Pneumothorax Pediatric Pulmonary Hypoplasia Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN) Pneumomediastinum Polycythemia of the Newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome Epidemiology OF Transient tachypnea of the newborn United States data Approximately 1% of infants have some form of respiratory distress that is not associated with infection. Respiratory distress includes both respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (ie, hyaline membrane disease) and transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). Of this 1%, approximately 33-50% have transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). Race-, sex-, and age-related demographics No racial predilection has been reported. Male neonates are more affected than females. Clinically, transient tachypnea of the newborn presents as respiratory distress in full-term or near-term infants. Treatment of Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN) — Drugs and Side Effects 1. Supportive Care (Primary Treatment) Oxygen therapy: To maintain adequate oxygen saturation; delivered via nasal cannula, oxygen hood, or CPAP if needed. Monitoring: Close observation and respiratory support as required. Most infants recover within 2–3 days. 2. Antibiotics Common regimen: Combination of an aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin) plus a beta-lactam antibiotic (e.g., ampicillin or penicillin) may be used if infection cannot be ruled out initially, as symptoms may overlap with neonatal infection. Potential side effects: Gentamicin: Ototoxicity (hearing loss), nephrotoxicity (kidney damage), requires blood level monitoring. Ampicillin: Allergic reactions, rash, gastrointestinal upset. Cautions: Use of antibiotics can alter gut flora and possibly increase risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC); therefore, antibiotics are used judiciously only when infection is suspected or cannot be excluded. 3. Inhaled Beta-2 Agonists (e.g., Salbutamol/Albuterol) Some studies suggest inhaled salbutamol may decrease the severity and shorten the duration of TTN by promoting fluid clearance from the lungs. Side effects: Possible tachycardia, jitteriness, hypokalemia, but generally well tolerated in neonates when used carefully. 4. Diuretics Occasionally used to promote removal of lung fluid, though no strong evidence supports routine use GENOMIC DATA OF Transient tachypnea of the newborn Beta-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms: A 2008 study found that loss-of-function variations in the beta1-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB1), specifically the beta1Gly49 homozygosity, significantly increase susceptibility to TTN. Similarly, a particular TACC haplotype in the beta2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2) is associated with higher TTN risk. These receptor genes modulate the catecholamine-driven process responsible for lung fluid absorption after delivery. Mechanism: Catecholamines released during labor stimulate lung epithelial sodium channels and inhibit chloride pumps, promoting rapid clearance of fetal lung fluid. Genetic variations that reduce receptor function may impair this process, leading to fluid retention in the lungs and resulting in TTN. Epidemiological associations: TTN occurs more frequently in male infants, those born by cesarean section without labor, and infants with lower gestational age and birthweight. Genetic predisposition acts alongside these environmental and clinical factors. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Transient tachypnea of the newborn Q. What is Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN)? A. TTN is a common cause of respiratory distress in newborns caused by delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid after birth. It usually presents with rapid breathing shortly after delivery and typically resolves within 48–72 hours. Q. What causes TTN? A. TTN occurs when the newborn’s lungs retain extra fluid that normally clears quickly after birth. This can happen due to cesarean delivery without labor, premature birth, or other factors that reduce the baby’s ability to absorb lung fluid. Q. What are the symptoms of TTN? A. Rapid breathing (tachypnea), usually over 60 breaths per minute Mild grunting or nasal flaring Mild chest retractions Possible mild cyanosis (bluish skin) Generally normal blood oxygen levels or mild hypoxia Q. How is TTN diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by chest X-ray showing fluid in the lung fissures, prominent pulmonary vasculature, and hyperinflation. Other causes of respiratory distress must be excluded, such as respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia. Q. How is TTN treated? A. Treatment is supportive: Oxygen therapy if needed Monitoring of breathing and oxygen saturation Rarely, nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for assistance Most infants improve within 2–3 days without specific medication Q. What is the prognosis for TTN? A. The prognosis is excellent. TTN is transient and resolves spontaneously typically within a few days without long-term effects. How can TTN be prevented? Cesarean delivery without labor and preterm birth are risk factors, but there is no guaranteed prevention. Encouraging labor before cesarean when possible may reduce risk. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Transient tachypnea of the newborn Doctor: Hello, I want to talk with you about your baby’s breathing issue called transient tachypnea of the newborn, or TTN. Do you have any questions before we begin? Parent: Yes, doctor. What exactly is TTN? Doctor: TTN is a mild breathing problem that usually happens within the first few hours after birth. Basically, babies are born with fluid in their lungs, and normally this fluid clears quickly once they start breathing air. Sometimes, though, extra lung fluid sticks around for a bit longer, making it harder for the baby to breathe comfortably. That’s what we call TTN. Parent: What causes this fluid to stay in the lungs? Doctor: When a baby passes through the birth canal during labor, the pressure and certain hormone changes help push fluid out of the lungs. Babies born by cesarean section without labor don’t get that benefit, so they’re more likely to have extra lung fluid at birth. Other factors like maternal asthma or diabetes can also increase the risk. Parent: What symptoms should I watch for? Doctor: You might notice your baby is breathing faster than normal — more than 60 breaths per minute — along with grunting, flaring of the nostrils, or pulling in around the ribs with each breath. Sometimes the skin around their mouth may look a little bluish because they’re working harder to get enough oxygen. Parent: How do you know it’s TTN and not something more serious? Doctor: We do a chest X-ray which usually shows extra fluid in the lungs and rules out other problems like pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome. We also monitor oxygen levels and may do blood tests to check for infection. TTN tends to get better within a few days on its own, which is a key sign. Parent: How is TTN treated? Doctor: Most babies just need supportive care. We give oxygen if needed, sometimes through a mask or nasal prongs. If their breathing is very fast or they’re having trouble feeding, they might get extra fluids through an IV or a feeding tube until they’re stronger. Rarely, we might use a breathing support machine called CPAP. Antibiotics may be started if there’s concern for infection, but usually discontinued if tests are negative. Parent: Will my baby recover fully? Doctor: Yes. TTN usually resolves within 2 to 3 days without long-term problems. Your baby should improve steadily once the lung fluid clears. Parent: What can we do to prevent TTN with future babies? Doctor: If possible, allowing labor to start before a cesarean section can help, but many cases are unpredictable. Overall, TTN is uncommon and usually temporary. Parent: Thank you, doctor. This helps me understand what’s going on. Doctor: You’re very welcome. We’ll keep monitoring your baby closely and keep you informed every step of the way. Please let us know if you notice any worsening breathing or feeding problems.

As a result, their heart can’t put enough oxygen into the blood it sends to the rest of their body. TAPVR is a life-threatening heart condition. It’s congenital, which means it’s present at birth. Typically, your lungs send oxygen-rich blood to your heart’s left atrium (the chamber in your heart’s upper left side). In babies with TAPVR, the oxygen-rich blood flows through pulmonary veins to their heart’s right atrium instead. In the right atrium, the oxygen-rich blood mixes with blood that doesn’t have as much oxygen. This low-oxygen blood travels out of the heart to the rest of your baby’s body. Babies with total anomalous pulmonary venous return may have trouble breathing soon after birth. Their skin may appear blue (or gray on darker skin). All children with TAPVR also have an atrial septal defect. This is a hole between the heart’s right and left atria. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return is a rare condition. It affects 1 in about 7,800 newborns in the U.S. each year. You may hear a provider call this condition total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC). Types of TAPVR TAPVR types differ by how blood reaches the wrong place — your baby’s right atrium. The TAPVR types are: Supracardiac TAPVR: Blood flows via an ascending vertical vein into the brachiocephalic vein. Then, it flows through their superior vena cava (a large vein in their body). Cardiac TAPVR: Blood moves through their coronary sinus. This vein normally drains blood that contains low levels of oxygen. Infracardiac TAPVR: The connecting vertical vein comes from their liver and inferior vena cava. Mixed TAPVR: A combination of veins from your baby’s lungs drain to more than one of the types mentioned above. This is the rarest and most difficult form to repair successfully. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of total anomalous pulmonary venous return may include: Cyanosis (bluish or grayish skin, nails and lips) Difficulty feeding Fatigue and lethargy (lack of energy) Heart murmur Shortness of breath (dyspnea) and trouble breathing Lack of growth or weight gain Symptoms of TAPVR usually appear very soon after birth. Babies have symptoms at birth if they have any narrowing where their lung veins connect to their hearts. But some babies don’t have symptoms for several weeks. TAPVR causes Healthcare providers aren’t sure what causes total anomalous pulmonary venous return. It happens when your baby’s heart and blood vessels are forming in the uterus during fetal development. This doesn’t seem to be an inherited condition (passed down through families). But there have been similar cases among siblings. TAPVR has an association with certain syndromes and exposure to paint removers, pesticides and lead. Complications of this condition A baby with TAPVR can have heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Even after the initial repair, TAPVR can sometimes lead to abnormal heart rhythms or blockages in your child’s pulmonary veins. Children with TAPVR may have trouble with typical development, like fine motor function. You can help your child by getting screenings for developmental milestones. If a screening shows a developmental delay, you can arrange for someone to work with them to improve their skills. Talk to your child’s healthcare provider about their ability to take part in sports and physical activities. Your child may need to limit vigorous exercise. Diagnosis and Tests Cardiologists can sometimes diagnose this condition with an echocardiogram before birth. Some babies don’t get a diagnosis until they’re several weeks or months old. After your baby is born, their provider will do a physical exam and listen to your baby’s heart. A pulse oximeter (pulse ox) can measure the amount of oxygen in your baby’s blood. It fits over your baby’s big toe and sends information through a wire. To diagnose total anomalous pulmonary venous return, a provider may use: Chest X-ray CT (computed tomography) scan Heart MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) Echocardiogram Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) Some of these tests (MRI) may require anesthesia, but they’re all noninvasive. They allow your baby’s healthcare provider to see images of your baby’s heart and veins. They also help them evaluate blood flow and look for abnormalities. A provider can use cardiac catheterization to make a diagnosis. But they can usually get the information they need from imaging. This spares your baby from an invasive procedure. Management and Treatment Healthcare providers treat TAPVR with open-heart surgery. Most often, providers perform this TAPVR repair as soon as they can after diagnosing the condition. Nearly every baby with total anomalous pulmonary venous return needs surgery to survive. Though it’s extremely rare, some people don’t have surgery as babies and get a TAPVR diagnosis as adults. But they usually have high pressures within their lungs (pulmonary hypertension). This can make surgical repair very challenging. While waiting for surgery, your child may receive extra oxygen or a ventilator to help them breathe. They may receive an inotrope, which is a medicine that helps their heartbeat more forcefully. While your baby is asleep under general anesthesia, a surgeon: Makes cuts (incisions) in your baby’s chest and heart Connects the pulmonary veins to the correct place (the left atrium) in your baby’s heart Closes abnormal connections Removes any blockage in your child’s pulmonary vein Most often, closes the hole between their left and right atria (atrial septal defect) When to see a doctor After TAPVR surgery, your baby will have checkups every six to 12 months. They’ll need regular follow-up visits through adulthood. Your child’s provider may want to order tests like an electrocardiogram, exercise stress test or echocardiogram. Get medical help right away if your baby: Has bluish or grayish skin, nails or lips Has trouble breathing or difficulty eating Seems lethargic Questions to consider asking your child’s healthcare provider may include: What type of TAPVR does my child have? Do you think my child will need a second operation? How many times have you performed surgery to repair TAPVR? Outlook / Prognosis Babies who have TAPVR need an operation. With early surgery, most children with TAPVR survive into adulthood. But some will need repeat surgery or procedures to treat narrowing in their veins later in life. Because of this, people with TAPVR need to see a cardiologist (a heart expert) regularly to monitor their health following surgery. Without surgery, some forms of total anomalous pulmonary venous return are typically fatal a few weeks after birth. With early diagnosis and surgical treatment, the outlook for babies with TAPVR is very good. The survival rate after surgery is around 97%. Your child will need regular visits with their cardiologist as they grow into adulthood. Lifelong follow-up visits can help cardiologists find problems like an irregular heartbeat or blockages (obstructions) in their blood vessels. An obstruction requires another surgery and may be hard to treat. Your child may need to take medicine or have a procedure like a cardiac catheterization. Prevention There’s nothing you could’ve done to prevent this congenital heart condition. But if you’re thinking of starting a family and have TAPVR or a family history of congenital heart conditions, you might want to speak with a healthcare provider. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF TAPVR TAPVC The differential diagnoses for TAPVC includes the following: Obstructed TAPVC Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Signs typically begin after birth, unlike TAPVC, where the presentation is slightly delayed (typically occurring after 12 hours of life). Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn 2. Unobstructed TAPVC: Large ASD, VSD Truncus arteriosus AV canal defects Single ventricle lesions Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) — typically in preterm infants, surfactant deficiency, early onset respiratory distress Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN) — hypoxia with normal heart anatomy and elevated pulmonary pressures Other cyanotic congenital heart diseases (CHDs): Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection (PAPVC) — some pulmonary veins drain abnormally, often milder symptoms Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) — may coexist, needs to be distinguished as a primary diagnosis Congestive heart failure from other causes — structural or functional cardiac issues Neonatal pneumonia or sepsis — infectious causes of respiratory distress Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) — pulmonary compromise due to herniated abdominal contents Airway anomalies or obstruction — rare but should be considered Pulmonary venous obstruction conditions mimicking TAPVR physiology Epidemiology of Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR): TAPVR is a rare congenital heart defect, occurring in approximately 0.6 to 1.2 per 10,000 live births (about 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 16,000 births) . It accounts for roughly 0.7% to 1.5% of all congenital heart diseases . In the United States, around 1 in 7,800 babies is born with TAPVR, equating to approximately 500 cases annually . There is a marked male predominance, with a male-to-female ratio of about 4:1—particularly notable in the infracardiac type of TAPVR . TAPVR typically presents in early infancy, often within the first few months of life, as survival without surgical correction is rare; median survival without repair is about 2 months, with 50% mortality in the first 3 months. TAPVR is classified into types (supracardiac, cardiac, infracardiac, and mixed), with supracardiac being the most common subtype (~47%). The mixed type TAPVR is rarer (~3-20% depending on series) and associated with higher surgical mortality rates compared to other types. Survival into adulthood without repair is exceedingly rare but can occur, especially in cases with large atrial septal defects allowing adequate systemic circulation . Advances in surgical techniques have improved survival rates, but mortality remains significant, particularly in complex or obstructed variant PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q. What is Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR)? A. TAPVR is a rare congenital heart defect where the pulmonary veins, which normally carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium, instead connect abnormally to the right atrium or systemic veins. This causes oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood, affecting oxygen delivery to the body. Q. What causes TAPVR? A. The exact cause is unknown, but it occurs during fetal development when the pulmonary veins fail to connect properly to the left atrium. TAPVR can occur alone or with other heart or body anomalies. Q. What are the types of TAPVR? A. There are four main types based on where the pulmonary veins drain: Supracardiac (most common) — veins drain above the heart to systemic veins like the superior vena cava Cardiac — drainage directly to the heart’s right atrium or coronary sinus Infracardiac — drainage below the heart, often through the liver veins or portal system (usually obstructed) Mixed — combination of two or more types Q. What symptoms does TAPVR cause? A. Symptoms depend on whether there is obstruction of pulmonary venous return: Without obstruction: mild cyanosis, signs of heart failure, fatigue, poor feeding With obstruction: severe cyanosis, respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and rapid deterioration shortly after birth Q. How is TAPVR diagnosed? A. Echocardiography is the main tool to visualize abnormal pulmonary venous connections. Chest X-ray may show cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, or a characteristic “snowman” shape in supracardiac type. Sometimes, cardiac MRI or catheterization is performed. Q. How is TAPVR treated? A. TAPVR requires surgical correction to reroute pulmonary veins to the left atrium. Medical management before surgery includes treating heart failure with diuretics and supporting oxygenation. Obstructed TAPVR is a surgical emergency. Q. What is the prognosis for TAPVR? A. Without surgery, TAPVR is usually fatal in infancy. Surgical repair has improved survival significantly, but long-term follow-up is needed for potential complications like pulmonary hypertension or arrhythmias. Q. Can TAPVR be prevented? A. There is no known prevention since it arises from developmental abnormalities during pregnancy. Q. What should families expect after surgery? A. Most children improve markedly, but require lifelong cardiology care. Endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended for six months post-surgery or longer if residual defects exist. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION Doctor: Hello, I want to talk about your baby’s heart condition called Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return, or TAPVR. Do you have any questions before we start? Parent: I’ve never heard of TAPVR before. What exactly is it? Doctor: TAPVR is a rare congenital heart defect where the veins that bring oxygen-rich blood from the lungs don’t connect to the left side of the heart as they should. Instead, they connect abnormally to the right side or other large veins. This means oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood, which can reduce the amount of oxygen delivered to the body. Parent: That sounds serious. What causes this? Doctor: The exact cause isn’t known—it happens during your baby’s heart development before birth. It’s not caused by anything you did or didn’t do during pregnancy. Parent: What kind of problems does TAPVR cause in my baby? Doctor: The problem depends on whether the abnormal veins are obstructed or not. If the blood flow returning from the lungs is blocked, your baby may have severe breathing difficulties and very low oxygen levels soon after birth. Without obstruction, symptoms may be milder but can still include tiredness, poor feeding, and signs of heart failure. Parent: How do you diagnose TAPVR? Doctor: We use an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart, to see exactly how the veins connect. Chest X-rays can also show signs that support the diagnosis. Sometimes more advanced imaging is used to plan treatment. Parent: Can TAPVR be fixed? Doctor: Yes. TAPVR requires surgery to reconnect the pulmonary veins to the left atrium, which is the normal heart chamber they should drain into. Before surgery, we may use medications to manage heart failure symptoms or support breathing if needed. Parent: Is the surgery risky? Doctor: Surgery always carries some risk, but it has greatly improved over the years. Most babies recover well, especially if the surgery is done early. Some forms of TAPVR and cases with obstruction have a higher risk, so urgent surgery might be necessary. Parent: What happens after surgery? Doctor: Your baby will be closely monitored in the hospital for several days to weeks. Long-term follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist is essential to watch for any complications, like narrowing of the veins or heart rhythm problems. Parent: Is there anything I need to do now? Doctor: Right now, we want to stabilize your baby and prepare for surgery. We will provide all the support your baby needs and keep you informed every step of the way. Parent: Thank you for explaining all this. It’s a lot to take in, but I appreciate your help. Doctor: I know it’s overwhelming. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions at any time.

It can result from various causes, such as motor vehicle accidents, falls, penetrating injuries, or blunt trauma. This comprehensive article aims to explore the different types and causes of thoracic trauma, its clinical presentation, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies. By understanding the complexities of thoracic trauma, healthcare professionals can provide timely and effective care to improve patient outcomes. Causes and Types of Thoracic Trauma: Thoracic trauma can occur due to a range of causes, including: Blunt trauma: This is the most common cause of thoracic trauma and typically results from motor vehicle accidents, falls, or physical assaults. Blunt trauma can cause rib fractures, lung contusions, pneumothorax, hemothorax, or cardiac injuries. Penetrating trauma: Stab wounds or gunshot wounds can directly injure the thoracic structures, including the lungs, heart, or major blood vessels. Penetrating trauma may lead to pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, or vascular injuries. Deceleration injuries: Sudden deceleration forces, such as those experienced in motor vehicle accidents, can cause significant thoracic trauma. This may result in aortic tears, pulmonary contusions, or rib fractures. Crush injuries: Crush injuries, often associated with industrial accidents or building collapses, can cause severe thoracic trauma, including rib fractures, lung contusions, and traumatic asphyxia. Blast injuries: Explosions or blast events can cause primary, secondary, or tertiary blast injuries, leading to a wide range of thoracic trauma, including lung contusions, pneumothorax, and pulmonary barotrauma. Diagnosis: The clinical presentation of thoracic trauma can vary depending on the type and severity of the injury. Common signs and symptoms include: Chest pain and tenderness: Patients may experience localized pain and tenderness over the chest area, particularly in the region of rib fractures or soft tissue injuries. Difficulty breathing: Thoracic trauma can lead to respiratory distress, shortness of breath, or shallow breathing due to lung contusions, pneumothorax, or hemothorax. Cyanosis: In severe cases, inadequate oxygenation may result in cyanosis, characterized by a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. Hemoptysis: Blood-tinged sputum or coughing up of blood may occur in cases of lung contusions or major vascular injuries. Abnormal breath sounds: Auscultation of the chest may reveal decreased breath sounds on the affected side in the presence of pneumothorax or lung collapse. Diagnostic approaches for thoracic trauma may include: Chest X-ray: A chest X-ray is typically the initial imaging modality used to assess for rib fractures, lung contusions, pneumothorax, hemothorax, or mediastinal abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) scan: CT scans provide detailed imaging of the thoracic structures and are useful in identifying specific injuries, such as aortic tears, pulmonary contusions, or cardiac injuries. Ultrasound: Ultrasound can assist in the detection of pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or pericardial effusions, aiding in prompt diagnosis and management decisions. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) or focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST): These techniques may be employed in cases of suspected diaphragmatic or abdominal injuries associated with thoracic trauma. Management of Thoracic Trauma: The management of thoracic trauma depends on the specific injuries and their severity. It may involve: Oxygen therapy: Supplemental oxygen is provided to ensure adequate oxygenation and maintain oxygen saturation levels. Pain management: Analgesics are administered to alleviate pain associated with rib fractures, chest wall injuries, or other thoracic trauma. Chest tube placement: In cases of pneumothorax or hemothorax, a chest tube is inserted to evacuate air or blood from the pleural space and restore normal lung function. Surgical interventions: Severe thoracic trauma, such as cardiac injuries, major vascular injuries, or diaphragmatic injuries, may require surgical repair or intervention. Close monitoring: Patients with thoracic trauma often require close monitoring in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting to ensure stability and prompt management of any complications. Common Pediatric Thoracic Trauma Diagnoses: Pulmonary contusion: Bruising of the lung parenchyma causing respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and abnormal breath sounds. Diagnosed primarily clinically and with chest X-ray showing patchy, nonanatomic opacities near the trauma site. May require oxygen or mechanical ventilation if extensive. Pneumothorax (including tension pneumothorax): Air in the pleural space caused by trauma leading to lung collapse. Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency with respiratory distress, tracheal deviation, distended neck veins, and hypotension. Requires immediate needle decompression or chest tube. Hemothorax / Hemopneumothorax: Accumulation of blood (and air) in pleural space causing respiratory distress and hypovolemia. Presents with decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion. May need chest tube drainage. Rib fractures and flail chest: Though less common in younger children due to thoracic compliance, rib fractures cause localized pain and can lead to flail segments causing paradoxical chest wall movement and respiratory failure. Pulmonary laceration: Tear in lung tissue causing bleeding and air leak; may present with hemoptysis. Cardiac injury and tamponade: Blunt or penetrating trauma may cause myocardial contusion or pericardial tamponade, causing hypotension, muffled heart sounds, distended veins (Beck’s triad), and shock. Tracheobronchial injuries: Lacerations or disruption causing persistent air leak, subcutaneous emphysema, respiratory distress. Traumatic aortic injury: Usually from high-energy deceleration; suspicion raised by widened mediastinum on X-ray, hypotension, and chest/back pain. Diaphragmatic rupture: Presentation includes respiratory distress and abdominal organ herniation into the chest cavity; bowel sounds may be heard in chest. Open pneumothorax: Chest wall wound allowing air ingress during respiration (“sucking chest wound”); needs surgical coverage and chest drainage. Pediatric Thoracic Trauma Epidemiology: Thoracic injuries in children are relatively infrequent, occurring in approximately 4% to 13% of pediatric trauma patients depending on the study and setting. A large national Dutch cohort study (2015–2019) reported that among 66,751 hospitalized pediatric trauma patients, 1.1% sustained chest injuries, corresponding to an incidence of about 4.9 per 100,000 person-years. The median age of children sustaining thoracic trauma in this study was approximately 11 years, with a male predominance (about 63%). Most common thoracic injuries included lung contusions (about 40%) and rib fractures (about 28%), although rib fractures are less common in very young children due to chest wall compliance. The mortality rate in pediatric thoracic trauma ranges considerably but can be as high as 6.8% to 30%, especially with severe injuries or associated multi-system trauma. Age influences injury patterns and outcomes; incidence and severity tend to increase with age, with older children more likely to sustain rib fractures and severe chest injuries. Common mechanisms of injury include: Motor vehicle accidents (cars, motorcycles) Bicycle accidents Falls (low and high energy) Pedestrian injuries Assaults and burns also contribute in smaller proportions. Approximately 43% of children with chest injuries in the Dutch study required intensive care admission, with a median hospital stay of 3 days. Pediatric thoracic trauma has one of the highest fatality rates among injury types: one US national trauma database reported a fatality rate of 7.7% among thoracic injury admissions in children. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q. What is pediatric thoracic trauma? A. Pediatric thoracic trauma refers to injury to the chest structures—including lungs, heart, blood vessels, ribs, and airways—in children following blunt or penetrating trauma. Q. How common is thoracic trauma in children? A. Thoracic injuries occur in less than 10% of pediatric trauma admissions. Pulmonary contusions are the most common thoracic injury in children, often occurring without rib fractures due to their more flexible chest wall. Q. What are the main causes of pediatric thoracic trauma? A. The leading causes include motor vehicle accidents, falls, bicycle accidents, and less commonly penetrating injuries such as stab wounds or gunshots. Q. What types of injuries occur in pediatric thoracic trauma? A. Pulmonary contusions (lung bruising) Pneumothorax (air in pleural space) and tension pneumothorax Hemothorax (blood in pleural space) Rib fractures (less common than in adults) Flail chest Cardiac contusion or tamponade Tracheobronchial injuries Diaphragmatic rupture Q. How do thoracic injuries in children differ from adults? A. Children have more compliant chest walls, making rib fractures rarer but allowing more force transmission to internal organs, leading to serious pulmonary contusions or internal injuries without obvious external signs. Q. What are the signs and symptoms of pediatric thoracic trauma? A. Rapid breathing, respiratory distress Chest pain or tenderness Cyanosis (bluish skin) Decreased breath sounds or abnormal chest movement Subcutaneous emphysema (air under the skin) Circulatory instability if associated with cardiac injury Q. How is pediatric thoracic trauma diagnosed? A. Clinical evaluation with airway, breathing, and circulation assessment following ATLS principles Chest X-ray is the primary imaging modality Ultrasound (eFAST exam) for detection of pneumothorax or hemothorax CT scans selectively used for detailed evaluation if needed Q. How is pediatric thoracic trauma treated? A. Immediate airway management and oxygenation support Needle decompression and chest tube placement for tension pneumothorax or large hemothorax Pain control and supportive care for contusions and rib fractures Surgery in cases of cardiac tamponade, diaphragmatic rupture, or major vascular injuries Q. What is the prognosis for children with thoracic trauma? A. Prognosis depends on injury severity. Pulmonary contusions often improve with supportive care; however, severe injuries, especially with vascular or cardiac involvement, carry significant morbidity and mortality risk. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION Doctor: Hello, I want to talk with you about your child’s recent chest injury and explain what we’re doing to help. Do you have any questions before we start? Parent: Thank you, doctor. I’m very worried. What exactly does a thoracic trauma mean for my child? Doctor: Thoracic trauma means that your child has sustained an injury to the chest area, which includes the lungs, ribs, and sometimes the heart and major blood vessels. In children, this can affect breathing and circulation depending on the severity and type of injury. Parent: What kind of injuries might happen with this kind of trauma? Doctor: Common injuries include bruising of the lungs called pulmonary contusions, air leaking into the chest cavity known as pneumothorax, bleeding into the chest or hemothorax, fractured ribs, or very rarely injury to the heart or major vessels. Because children’s chest walls are more flexible than adults’, sometimes internal injuries can be serious even if there’s no obvious fracture. Parent: How do you know what injuries my child has? Doctor: We start with a thorough clinical examination, monitoring breathing and circulation carefully. Chest X-rays give us a good initial view. We also use ultrasound to look quickly for things like fluid or air around the lungs. Occasionally, a CT scan may be recommended for more detailed images. Parent: What treatments will my child need? Doctor: Treatment depends on the injuries found. Many lung bruises get better with oxygen and supportive care. If there is air or blood in the chest, we might place a chest tube to remove it and help your child breathe easier. In severe cases with injured blood vessels or heart, surgery may be necessary. Throughout, we provide pain relief and monitor closely. Parent: Is this life-threatening? What’s the outlook? Doctor: Serious chest injuries can be life-threatening, but with prompt diagnosis and treatment, most children recover well. We’re monitoring your child closely in the hospital and providing all necessary support. The key is rapid intervention to prevent complications. Parent: Will my child need surgery? Doctor: At this stage, we are assessing carefully. Most children with lung bruises or small pneumothoraces don’t require surgery and improve with supportive care. If a chest tube or surgery becomes necessary, we will discuss it with you immediately. Parent: What should I watch for in case things get worse? Doctor: Watch for signs like increased difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain, unusual paleness or blueness around lips, or decreased activity and responsiveness. Please alert any staff immediately if you notice these. Parent: Thank you for explaining everything. It’s a relief to know how you’re managing my child. Doctor: I understand this is very stressful. We’ll keep you informed every step of the way and answer all your questions. REFERENCES https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534843/ SARCOIDOSIS DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION Sarcoidosis is a condition that causes tiny collections of immune system cells in any part of the body. These tiny collections form red, swollen lumps called granulomas. Granulomas most commonly occur in the lungs and the lymph nodes of the chest. They also can occur in the eyes, skin, heart and other organs. Experts don\\'t know the exact cause of sarcoidosis, but it\\'s likely a mix of genetic and environmental factors. Some people appear to have gene changes that make them more likely to develop sarcoidosis. The condition may then be triggered by bacteria, viruses, dust or chemicals. Their immune system overreacts to the trigger, causing inflammation that forms granulomas. There is no cure for sarcoidosis, but most people do not need treatment. Sarcoidosis may go away on its own. Other people need treatment to lessen their body\\'s immune system response. Sometimes sarcoidosis can last for years and may cause organ damage. Causes The cause of sarcoidosis is not known. Experts think it results from a mix of genetic and environmental factors that cause the body\\'s immune system to overreact to a substance it doesn\\'t know. Some people have gene changes that make their immune system more likely to overreact to triggers. Triggers could be bacteria, viruses, chemicals or dust. This causes immune cells to group into tiny collections of inflamed lumps called granulomas. As granulomas build up in an organ, the function of that organ can be affected. Risk factors While anyone can develop sarcoidosis, factors that may raise your risk include: Age and sex. Sarcoidosis can happen at any age, but often occurs between the ages of 20 and 60 years. Women are slightly more likely to develop the condition than are men. Race. Sarcoidosis occurs more often in people of African descent and those of Northern European descent. African Americans are more likely to have sarcoidosis in other organs along with the lungs. Job or hobbies. Working around chemicals and dust can raise your risk. Family history. If someone in your family has had sarcoidosis, you\\'re more likely to get the condition. Symptoms Symptoms of sarcoidosis vary, depending on which organs are affected and how badly they\\'re affected. Sarcoidosis sometimes develops slowly over time and causes symptoms that last for years. Other times, symptoms appear suddenly and then disappear just as quickly. Many people with sarcoidosis have no symptoms, so the condition is found only when a chest X-ray is done for another reason. General symptoms Sarcoidosis can begin with these symptoms: Extreme tiredness. Slight fever. Swollen lymph nodes, such as in the chest, neck, armpits or groin. Weight loss. Pain and swelling in joints, such as the ankles. Lung symptoms Sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs and may cause lung problems, such as: Ongoing dry cough. Shortness of breath. A squeaking sound when breathing out, called wheezing. Chest pain. Skin symptoms Sarcoidosis may cause skin problems, which may include: A rash of small, itchy bumps, usually on the head, neck or legs. The rash may be painful. Open sores on the nose, lips, cheeks and ears, called skin lesions. Areas of skin that are darker or lighter in color. Growths under the skin, especially around scars or tattoos. Eye symptoms Sarcoidosis can affect the eyes without causing any symptoms, so it\\'s important to have your eyes checked regularly. When eye symptoms do occur, they may include: Blurred vision. Eye pain. Watery eyes. Burning, itching or dry eyes. Severe redness. Sensitivity to light. Heart symptoms Symptoms related to cardiac sarcoidosis may include: Chest pain. Shortness of breath. Fainting. Heartbeats that aren\\'t regular, called arrhythmias. Rapid or fluttering heartbeats, called palpitations. Swelling caused by extra fluid in the body. Nervous system symptoms Sarcoidosis can cause symptoms related to the brain and nerves, such as: Headaches. Dizziness. Changes in vision. Confusion. Weakness. Nerve pain, numbness or tingling. Seizures. Other symptoms Other symptoms are usually linked with the organs affected. Sarcoidosis can cause granulomas in any part of the body, such as the liver, spleen, muscles, bones and joints, kidneys, and lymph nodes. When to see a doctor See a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have symptoms that may be sarcoidosis. Diagnosis Sarcoidosis can be hard to diagnose because there may not be many symptoms in the early stages. When symptoms do occur, they may be much like those of other conditions. Your healthcare professional does a physical exam and talks with you about your symptoms and possible risk factors. The healthcare professional also listens to your heart and lungs, checks your lymph nodes for swelling, and looks at any skin lesions. No tests can specifically diagnose sarcoidosis. Tests can help rule out other conditions and show what body systems may be affected by sarcoidosis. For example, you may have: Blood and urine tests to check your overall health and how well your kidneys and liver are working. Chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart. Computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest to look at your lungs. Lung function tests, also called pulmonary function tests, to measure how much air you can breathe in and out and how much oxygen your lungs send to your blood. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) and cardiac ultrasound to check for heart problems and look at your heart\\'s health. Eye exam to check for vision problems that may be caused by sarcoidosis. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if sarcoidosis may be affecting your heart or central nervous system. Other tests may be added, if needed. Biopsy Your healthcare professional may take a small sample of tissue called a biopsy. The sample is taken from any part of your body that may be affected by sarcoidosis. The sample is used to look for the granulomas commonly seen with the condition. For example, biopsies can be taken from your skin, lungs and lymph nodes. Treatment There\\'s no cure for sarcoidosis, but often sarcoidosis goes away on its own. You may not need treatment if you have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. If you need treatment, the type of treatment you have depends on how severe your symptoms are and what organs are affected. Treatment can lessen the body\\'s immune system response and inflammation. Medicines If your symptoms are severe or affected organs aren\\'t working properly, you may need medicines. These can include: Corticosteroids. These powerful medicines lessen inflammation. They\\'re usually the first treatment tried for sarcoidosis. The medicine can be given as pills or shots. In some cases, corticosteroids can be put directly on the affected area. Examples of these types of medicines include cream put on skin lesions or rash, medicine breathed into the lungs using an inhaler, and drops put into the eyes. Medicines that lower the immune system\\'s response. Medicines such as methotrexate (Trexall) and azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) lessen inflammation by lowering the immune system\\'s response to a trigger. Hydroxychloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) may be helpful for skin lesions and high blood-calcium levels. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors. These medicines are commonly used to treat inflammation from rheumatoid arthritis. They also can be helpful in treating sarcoidosis that hasn\\'t responded to other treatments. Other medicines may be used to treat specific symptoms or complications. Other treatments Depending on your symptoms or complications, you may need other treatments. For example, you may have: Physical therapy to lessen tiredness and strengthen muscles. Pulmonary rehabilitation to help ease breathing and do more activities. Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator for heart rhythm problems. An organ transplant may be an option for some people if sarcoidosis has severely damaged the lungs, heart or liver. Ongoing monitoring How often you see your healthcare professional varies based on your symptoms and treatment. Seeing your healthcare professional regularly is important ― even if you don\\'t need treatment. Your healthcare professional monitors your symptoms and checks to see if you need treatment, how treatments are working and if you have complications. Ongoing monitoring may include tests based on your condition. For example, you may have regular chest X-rays, blood and urine tests, EKGs, and exams of your lungs, eyes, skin and other organs. Follow-up care is likely lifelong. Lifestyle and home remedies Along with your treatment, these self-care tips can help: Follow your treatment plan. Even if you start to feel better, don\\'t stop taking your medicine without talking with your healthcare professional. Keep all follow-up appointments. Let your healthcare professional know if you have new or worsening symptoms. Make healthy lifestyle choices. These can include eating a healthy diet, working toward or keeping a healthy weight, managing stress, and getting enough sleep. Get regular physical activity. Regular physical activity or exercise can raise your mood, strengthen muscles and help lessen tiredness that can get in the way of your daily activities. Avoid lung irritants. As much as possible, stay away from smoke, dust, chemicals and other substances that irritate your lungs. If you smoke, talk with your healthcare professional about ways to quit. Outlook / Prognosis The severity of sarcoidosis is different from person to person. For most people, it’s a temporary condition that goes away on its own or with treatment. For some, it’s a chronic illness that causes permanent damage. About two-thirds of people diagnosed with sarcoidosis will eventually be disease-free (sarcoidosis will go into remission) in two to three years. Löfgren syndrome has a particularly good prognosis, with most cases resolving in six months to two years. Most people who still have sarcoidosis after three years are likely to have chronic disease. Only about 10% to 20% of those with chronic sarcoidosis will have permanent organ damage. The most common complication of sarcoidosis in the U.S. is lung scarring. What is the life expectancy of a person with sarcoidosis? Most people with sarcoidosis can expect to live as long as someone without sarcoidosis. A small percentage (1% to 5%) of sarcoidosis cases are fatal. Prevention Since we don’t know for sure what causes sarcoidosis, there’s no way to prevent it or reduce your risk of getting it. Taking medications as prescribed by your healthcare provider will reduce your risk of organ damage that granulomas can cause. Living With The best way to take care of yourself while living with sarcoidosis is to follow the recommendations of your healthcare provider. Monitor your symptoms for changes and take any medications as directed. Complications Sometimes sarcoidosis causes long-term problems. Lungs. Pulmonary sarcoidosis that isn\\'t treated can lead to scarring in the lungs that lasts forever. This scarring is called pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis makes it hard to breathe and sometimes causes pulmonary hypertension. Eyes. Inflammation can affect almost any part of the eye. It may cause damage to the retina, which over time can affect vision. Sarcoidosis can cause cataracts and glaucoma. Kidneys. Sarcoidosis can affect how your body handles calcium. Sarcoidosis can result in too much calcium in the bloodstream, a condition called hypercalcemia. This can lead to kidney stones and affect how well the kidneys work. Rarely, long-term kidney disease can occur. Heart. Cardiac sarcoidosis results in granulomas in the heart. These can cause problems with heart rhythm, blood flow and heart function. Rarely, sarcoidosis results in heart problems that may cause death. Nervous system. Some people with sarcoidosis develop problems related to the central nervous system. This occurs when granulomas form in the nerves, brain and spinal cord. For example, granulomas in the facial nerves can cause paralyzed facial muscles. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q. What are the benefits of treatment vs. monitoring symptoms? A. Many cases of sarcoidosis improve or even resolve without treatment, especially if symptoms are mild. Observation with regular follow-up may be appropriate in these cases. Treatment is usually recommended to control bothersome symptoms, prevent organ damage (especially in critical organs like heart, brain, or eyes), and improve quality of life. Your doctor will evaluate the extent of organ involvement and severity to decide if treatment is needed. Q. How long will it be before I can expect symptom improvement? A. Improvement timelines vary from a few weeks up to several months after starting treatment. Corticosteroids often show symptom control within weeks, but full remission may take longer. Your provider will monitor your progress closely to adjust therapy as needed. Q. How do I know if my treatment’s working? A. Your healthcare team will track symptoms, physical exam findings, and use tests such as chest X-rays, lung function tests, blood markers, and organ-specific assessments to monitor disease activity. Improvement or stability on these is a good sign treatment is effective. Relapses or progression may prompt changes in therapy. Q. Are there any lifestyle changes I should make? A. Following your treatment plan and attending regular check-ups are essential. Avoiding smoking and environmental exposures that can worsen lung health is advised. Maintaining a healthy diet, managing stress, and staying physically active as tolerated can support your overall well-being. Inform your provider about any side effects or new symptoms promptly. Q. When should I follow up with you? A. Follow-up timing depends on your individual case—whether you are being observed or treated, and the organs involved. Regular monitoring is important since sarcoidosis can fluctuate or affect new organs. Your doctor may schedule visits every few months initially, then space them out if stable, but lifelong follow-up is often recommended Differential Diagnoses Cat Scratch Disease (Cat Scratch Fever) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Eosinophilic Granuloma (Pulmonary Histiocytosis X) Follicular Lymphoma Fungal Infection Hilar Infiltrates Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Leprosy Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis Mediastinal Lymphoma Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Noncaseating Granuloma (NCG) on Biopsy Primary Biliary Cholangitis (Primary Biliary Cirrhosis) Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Tuberculosis (TB) Epidemiology United States statistics Incidence ranges from 5-40 cases per 100,000 population. The age-adjusted incidence for Whites is 11 cases per 100,000 population. The incidence is considerably higher in African Americans, at 34 cases per 100,000 population. The prevalence is 10 times greater for African Americans than for Whites. Approximately 20% of patients who are African American reported an affected family member, while only 5% of Whites in the United States who have sarcoidosis said they have family members also diagnosed with sarcoidosis. In African Americans, siblings and parents of sarcoidosis cases have about a 2.5-fold increased risk for developing the disease. Working on the World Trade Center (WTC) debris pile after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was found to be associated with sarcoidosis(odds ratio, 9.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-74.0), but WTC dust cloud exposure was not (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-2.8). International statistics Incidence is 20 cases per 100,000 population in Sweden and 1.3 cases per 100,000 population in Japan. Sarcoidosis occurs in China, Africa, India, and other developing countries. Although its incidence may be low, the disease remains hidden and often is misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. Race-, sex-, and age-related demographics African Americans seem to experience more severe and chronic disease. Male-to-female ratio is approximately 1:2. Morbidity, mortality, and extrapulmonary involvement are higher in affected females. Incidence peaks in persons aged 25-35 years. A second peak occurs for women aged 45-65 years. Procedures Diagnosis requires biopsy in most cases. If therapy is to be given for sarcoidosis, tissue confirmation is essential. Watchful waiting is indicated only for patients who exhibit a classic presentation, are asymptomatic, and will reliably follow up. The hallmark histologic finding is the presence of noncaseating granulomas (NCGs) with special stains negative for fungus and mycobacteria. Transbronchial biopsy via fiberoptic bronchoscopy has a high diagnostic yield. Results may be positive, even in the setting of normal chest radiography findings. Standard transbronchial needle aspiration allows successful lymph node sampling in nearly all patients with sarcoidosis and is associated with high diagnostic yield regardless of disease stage. Endobronchial biopsy is performed during bronchoscopy and increases the yield of the procedure. In a study of 34 subjects, endobronchial biopsy findings were positive in 61.8% of patients with a yield comparable to transbronchial biopsy, which showed non necrotizing granulomas in 58.8% of subjects. The addition of endobronchial biopsy increased the yield of fiberoptic bronchoscopy by 20.6%. At least one study has shown that the diagnostic yield of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for stage I and II sarcoidosis is even higher than standard transbronchial lung biopsy. In at least one study, the CD4/CD8 ratio and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–α levels in induced sputum correlated with those in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and paralleled changes with treatment. Induced sputum may therefore be a surrogate for BALF for certain markers in patients with sarcoidosis. In another study, the differential cell count in BALF demonstrated a significantly lower percentage of neutrophils and a significantly higher percentage of macrophages than in induced sputum. The profiles of T-cell subsets, however, showed the same pattern in both groups. A CD4/CD8 ratio of 2.5 or greater had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 81.2%, with a positive predictive value of 81.2%, distinguishing sarcoidosis from non granulomatous interstitial lung diseases. Sarcoidosis Treatment: Drugs and Their Side Effects 1. Corticosteroids (First-Line Therapy) Examples: Prednisone, Dexamethasone, Triamcinolone Mechanism: Reduce inflammation by suppressing immune response. Common Dosage: Prednisone typically 5–40 mg daily; dosage individualized based on severity. Side Effects: Osteoporosis Weight gain and fluid retention (\"moon face\") Diabetes and elevated blood sugar Hypertension Cataracts and glaucoma Mood changes including depression and psychosis Nausea, vomiting, headaches, acne Notes: Long-term use requires close monitoring due to significant side effects. 2. Immunosuppressants / Steroid-Sparing Agents Used to reduce steroid dose or when steroids are not tolerated or insufficient. Methotrexate: 10-15 mg once weekly Side effects: Nausea, bone marrow suppression, liver toxicity, pulmonary toxicity Azathioprine: 50-250 mg daily Side effects: Nausea, bone marrow suppression, liver toxicity, increased malignancy risk Leflunomide: 10-20 mg daily Side effects: Nausea, peripheral neuropathy, interstitial pneumonia Mycophenolate mofetil: 500-1500 mg twice daily Side effects: Diarrhea, possible blood cell count changes 3. Antimalarial Drugs Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil®), Chloroquine Used especially for cutaneous sarcoidosis and hypercalcemia Side effects: Retinopathy (requires ophthalmologic monitoring), gastrointestinal upset Less potent than methotrexate but safer for some patients 4. Biologic Agents (TNF-alpha Inhibitors) Used for refractory cases or neurosarcoidosis. Infliximab: 3-5 mg/kg initially, then repeated doses every 4–6 weeks Side effects: Risk of infections including tuberculosis reactivation, infusion reactions, contraindicated in severe heart failure Adalimumab: 40 mg every 1–2 weeks Side effects: Similar infectious risks, injection site reactions Rituximab: 500-1000 mg every 1-6 months for select cases Side effects: Increased infection risk, screened for hepatitis and tuberculosis prior to use 5. Other Agents (Less Common) Colchicine, Cyclophosphamide, Corticotropin (Acthar Gel) may be considered in specific situations or refractory disease but are less commonly used. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION Doctor: Hello! I understand you\\'ve recently been diagnosed with sarcoidosis. I’d like to talk with you about what this means and answer any questions you have. How are you feeling about the diagnosis? Patient: Thanks, doctor. I’m a bit overwhelmed. I don\\'t really know much about sarcoidosis. What exactly is it? Doctor: That’s completely understandable. Sarcoidosis is a condition where small clusters of inflammatory cells, called granulomas, form in various organs—most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes. We don’t know exactly what causes it, but it’s related to an overactive immune response. Patient: Will it get worse? Is it serious? Doctor: The course of sarcoidosis varies quite a bit. For many people, it’s mild and even resolves on its own without treatment. However, in some cases it can affect how organs work, and treatment may be needed to control symptoms or prevent organ damage. We’ll monitor you closely to decide the best approach. Patient: What treatments are there? Doctor: The first-line treatment is usually corticosteroids, like prednisone, which reduce inflammation. For those who can’t take steroids or need long-term treatment, we might use other immune-suppressing medications. If your sarcoidosis is mild and not causing problems, sometimes we just monitor symptoms without medicines. Patient: How long will I need treatment? Doctor: That depends on how well you respond. Some people take steroids for several months, gradually tapering off, while others might need longer treatment if symptoms persist or come back. Regular follow-ups and tests help us tailor the plan. Patient: Are there side effects I should worry about? Doctor: Steroids can have side effects like weight gain, mood changes, high blood sugar, and bone thinning, especially if used long-term. That’s why we use the lowest effective dose and consider other medications if treatment lasts a long time. We’ll also monitor you carefully to manage any side effects early. Patient: Is there anything I can do myself? Doctor: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle helps—eating well, staying active as you can, avoiding smoking, and managing stress. Also, keep all your follow-up appointments, and let us know if you notice new symptoms like increased fatigue, shortness of breath, or new pain. Patient: How often will I need check-ups? Doctor: Initially, every few months to monitor your symptoms and organ function. Once stable, we might space them out. Sarcoidosis can change over time, so lifelong monitoring is important. Patient: Thank you for explaining. It helps to know what to expect. Doctor: You’re very welcome. It’s a lot to take in, but we are here to support you. Please call or come in if anything changes or if you have questions between visits. REFERENCES Sarcoidosis - Symptoms and causes - Mayo Clinic Sarcoidosis: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis & Treatment https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301914-treatment ASPIRIN EXACERBATED RESPIRATORY DISEASE DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also called Samter\\'s triad, has three features: Asthma, although only a small number of people with asthma will develop AERD. Nasal polyps that often come back, even after taken out by surgery. Problems with taking aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen. Keep in mind that aspirin or NSAIDs may be in cold medicines and other medicines. Usually, warning signs of AERD don\\'t show up until people have reached their 30s or 40s, but AERD can sometimes happen in children. What happens when people with AERD take aspirin or NSAIDs? Problems usually start suddenly and can be serious. Symptoms may include trouble breathing, which could be an asthma flare-up, wheezing, coughing, sneezing, and a stuffy or runny nose. Some people with AERD also have these types of problems if they drink alcohol, such as beer or wine. What causes AERD? The exact cause of AERD is not known but it is not an allergic response. There is no proof to show that it\\'s genetic or inherited. The disease is not caused by taking aspirin or NSAIDs, but AERD sinus or asthma symptoms get worse when taking these medicines. DIAGNOSIS There is no special test to find AERD. There are lab tests that can help in finding the cause of your illness. There is a blood test to look for higher than usual levels of white blood cells called eosinophils. And there is a urine test to look for raised leukotrienes, which are chemicals that can cause tightening of the airways. AERD also may affect your sense of smell. Finding AERD is possible if you have all three of these things: asthma, nasal polyps, and respiratory problems when taking aspirin or NSAIDs. When it\\'s not clear whether you have a problem taking aspirin or NSAIDs, your health care provider may do an aspirin challenge called desensitization. This is done to check if you have AERD. Your provider and medical team give you aspirin in a safe medical surrounding and follow special safety rules. TREATMENT There is no cure for AERD, but several treatments can be given, depending on your illness. A blend of treatments often work best. Choices are: Stay away from aspirin and NSAIDs, unless your health care provider prescribes desensitization to aspirin. Taking medicines to treat asthma, such as corticosteroids that you breathe in. Surgery to remove nasal polyps, although they can come back. Taking medicines such as montelukast (Singulair, zafirlukast (Accolate) or zileuton (Zyflo) to block leukotrienes. Injecting man-made proteins into your body that connect to certain targets. These proteins, called monoclonal antibodies, try to affect cells that are causing your problem. Having desensitization to aspirin. Aspirin is given in the health care provider\\'s office in slowly increasing doses over two days. After that, it is taken daily at high doses, which may help lessen the need for oral steroids. It also may stop nasal polyps from coming back. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Allergic (atopic) asthma: Common asthma with typical allergic triggers; differs in that aspirin/NSAID reactions are absent. Nonallergic rhinitis: Nasal symptoms without aspirin sensitivity or asthma. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP): May occur without aspirin sensitivity or asthma; distinguishes from AERD due to lack of NSAID reactions. NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema: Skin manifestations without respiratory symptoms. NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease: Similar to above, without respiratory involvement. Idiopathic (nonsteroidal) drug hypersensitivity: Respiratory symptoms triggered by drugs but with different mechanisms and no nasal polyps or asthma. Other causes of nasal polyps: Cystic fibrosis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA): Has asthma and eosinophilia but with vasculitis and systemic features absent in typical AERD. Infectious or nonallergic causes of asthma exacerbation: Viral infections, irritants. Other NSAID hypersensitivity syndromes: Some patients react to NSAIDs without asthma or nasal polyps. EPIDEMIOLOGY Epidemiology of Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD): The estimated prevalence of AERD among adult asthmatic patients is approximately 7%, with estimates ranging from about 5.5% to 12.4% depending on study design and population. Among individuals with severe asthma, prevalence rises to as high as 15% (about 14.9%). In patients with nasal polyps and chronic rhinosinusitis, prevalence estimates are around 9–10%. The prevalence of AERD in the general population is much lower, estimated at about 0.3% to 2.5%. Studies report that 10% to 20% of all persons with asthma experience exacerbations triggered by aspirin or NSAIDs, and up to 30% in asthmatic patients with nasal polyposis may have AERD features. AERD typically presents in adulthood, with the average onset of symptoms (nasal polyps, asthma, aspirin sensitivity) between 30 and 34 years of age. There is a female predominance in AERD cases, with about 57% to 66% being women in study cohorts. Genetic predisposition is suggested by familial clustering in about 6% of cases. AERD is rare in children, though some pediatric cases exist. The disease is associated with increased morbidity and healthcare costs due to exacerbations and treatments, highlighting the importance of early recognition PREDEFINED QUESTION AND ANSWER Q. What is AERD? A. Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD), also called Samter’s Triad, is a chronic condition characterized by three key features: asthma, nasal polyps with chronic sinus inflammation, and sensitivity to aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can trigger respiratory symptoms. Q. What causes AERD? A. The exact cause is unknown, but it involves a chronic inflammatory process in the respiratory tract. People with AERD have an abnormal reaction that causes increased leukotriene production and inflammation when exposed to aspirin or NSAIDs. Q. What are the symptoms? A. Nasal congestion and sinus pressure Recurrent nasal polyps Asthma symptoms like wheezing and shortness of breath Respiratory reactions after taking aspirin or NSAIDs, including nasal blockage, asthma attacks, and sometimes, skin flushing or gastrointestinal symptoms Q. How is AERD diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is clinical, based on the triad of asthma, nasal polyps, and NSAID sensitivity. Medical history and physical exam are essential. Sometimes aspirin challenge testing in a controlled setting is used to confirm diagnosis. Q. How is AERD treated? A. Avoidance of aspirin and NSAIDs unless desensitized. Acetaminophen is usually safe at low doses. Daily inhaled corticosteroids for asthma, nasal steroid sprays or rinses for sinus symptoms. Oral or injected corticosteroids may be used for severe symptoms or nasal polyps. Leukotriene modifiers like montelukast or zileuton can help reduce inflammation. Aspirin desensitization: a supervised process where aspirin doses are gradually increased to induce tolerance, allowing patients to take aspirin daily, which can reduce polyp regrowth and improve symptoms. Biologic therapies targeting type 2 inflammation (e.g., dupilumab, mepolizumab) may be effective for severe cases. Q. Is there a cure for AERD? A. There is no cure, but effective treatments can control symptoms, reduce polyp recurrence, improve asthma control, and enhance quality of life. Q. What should I avoid? A. Aspirin and most NSAIDs unless you have undergone aspirin desensitization. Also avoid respiratory irritants like smoke. Q. Can I take other pain relievers? A. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is generally safe at low doses (up to 500 mg), but it’s best to discuss alternatives with your doctor. Q. What is aspirin desensitization and who should have it? A. It’s a supervised medical procedure to gradually increase aspirin tolerance. Nearly 9 out of 10 patients can subsequently take aspirin daily without reactions. It is recommended for patients with severe AERD or frequent nasal polyp regrowth. Q. How often should I follow up with my doctor? A. Regular monitoring is needed to assess asthma control, sinus health, and medication side effects. Your doctor will individualize follow-up based on severity. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION Doctor: Hello, I’d like to discuss your recent diagnosis of Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease, or AERD. Do you have any questions before we start? Patient: I’ve never heard of AERD before. What exactly is it? Doctor: AERD, sometimes called Samter’s triad, is a chronic condition that includes three main problems: asthma, chronic sinus inflammation with recurrent nasal polyps, and sensitivity to aspirin and other NSAID medications. When someone with AERD takes aspirin or certain other pain relievers, it can trigger asthma attacks, nasal congestion, or other respiratory symptoms. Patient: That sounds serious. What causes it? Doctor: The exact cause isn’t fully understood, but it involves an abnormal inflammatory response in your airways. When you take aspirin or related drugs, it affects certain pathways in your body that leads to increased inflammation and respiratory symptoms. It’s not a typical allergy, and it’s not inherited. Patient: What kind of symptoms should I expect? Doctor: Most patients experience nasal congestion, sinus pressure, and recurring nasal polyps that can block the sinuses. The asthma symptoms can include wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. If you take aspirin or many NSAIDs, these symptoms can worsen rapidly. Patient: Can I still take painkillers? Doctor: If you haven\\'t undergone aspirin desensitization, you should avoid aspirin and most NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen, as they can trigger reactions. Acetaminophen is usually safe at low doses, but it’s best to check with your provider first. Patient: How is AERD treated? Doctor: Treatment involves managing your asthma and sinus symptoms with inhaled steroids, nasal sprays, and sometimes courses of oral steroids. Many patients also take medications that block inflammatory substances called leukotrienes. In addition, aspirin desensitization is a procedure where we carefully give increasing doses of aspirin under medical supervision to build your tolerance. After that, daily aspirin can improve your symptoms and reduce polyp regrowth. There are also newer biologic medicines that help some patients. Patient: Is there a cure? Doctor: There’s no cure, but these treatments can help you manage symptoms well and improve your quality of life. Regular follow-up is important to monitor your condition and adjust treatments as needed. Patient: What about surgery for nasal polyps? Doctor: Many patients do need sinus surgery to remove polyps, but unfortunately, polyps can regrow, which is why ongoing medical management including possibly aspirin therapy is key. Patient: Are there side effects or risks with aspirin desensitization? Doctor: Some patients experience mild gastrointestinal symptoms during desensitization or with daily aspirin, like stomach discomfort, but serious complications are uncommon when done in the right setting. We monitor you closely throughout. Patient: What should I do if I have a reaction? Doctor: If you take a medication and start wheezing, have severe nasal blockage, or other breathing trouble, seek medical attention immediately. Always inform healthcare providers about your AERD. Patient: Thank you for the explanation. I feel more informed now. Doctor: You’re welcome. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions anytime. We’ll work together to manage this condition effectively.

Bacteria and viruses typically cause pneumonia. Fungi can also cause some types of pneumonia. Pneumonia affects millions of people around the world each year. In the United States, about 25 of every 10,000 people get pneumonia each year. That rate gets higher as age increases. Some people develop a serious case of pneumonia while in the hospital. But it’s more common to develop pneumonia outside a hospital setting. When this happens, doctors refer to it as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). CAP is the most common type of pneumonia people experience. Although it’s not usually as serious as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), it can still have serious complications. This article will look at CAP, how it compares with other types of pneumonia, and what you can do to protect yourself. Types of pneumonia Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): CAP refers to pneumonia you develop outside a hospital setting. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): Also called nosocomial pneumonia HAP occurs if you fall ill with pneumonia 48 hours or more after your admission to the hospital. HAP is usually more serious than CAP because it can involve bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): A subgroup of people with HAP may develop VAP. It occurs in hospital patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. What causes community-acquired pneumonia? Pneumonia has many causes. Research from 2017 references 26 common causes of CAP, mainly bacteria and viruses. Some fungi can also cause CAP. The most common causes of CAP in the United States are: human rhinovirus (common cold) influenza virus (flu) Streptococcus pneumoniae Other common causes include: the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Haemophilus influenzae Legionella bacteria Mycoplasma pneumonia hard-to-detect bacteria, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae So, how do humans come in contact with these germs? Some of them, like Streptococcus pneumoniae, already live in your nose, sinuses, or mouth. They can eventually spread to your lungs, where they cause disease. It’s unclear why they invade the lungs. You might also breathe in these germs if they are in the air around you. Certain activities or environments may increase your risk of coming in contact with them. Who is at risk of community-acquired pneumonia? CAP and its complications are most likely to affect: adults older than age 65 people with existing health conditions people with a weakened immune system people who smoke people who are malnourished Children younger than 5 years also have a higher risk of CAP, as well as those who may interact with them in day care settings. Health conditions Certain conditions may increase your risk of developing CAP. According to a 2017 review of 29 studies, these include: chronic bronchitis or COPD asthma diseases of the mouth, teeth, or gums conditions that cause impaired function While the review was inconclusive on whether heart disease was a risk factor, other research from 2015 suggests it is. Other conditions, such as diabetes and liver disease, may affect your outlook with CAP. Researchers in the 2017 review also identified certain medications that may increase your risk: immunosuppressants oral steroids proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers (both used to treat gastric reflux) Environmental exposure According to the World Health Organization environmental factors may also affect your risk of CAP. These include: indoor air pollution from biomass fuels crowded homes secondhand smoke living on or near a farm with livestock living near centers of industrial food animal production According to 2015 research, people who smoke cigarettes also have a higher risk of CAP. Zoonotic (animal) exposure Exposure to certain animals that may carry the germs that cause CAP could put you at risk. According to research from 2016 and 2017, examples include: birds, including poultry rabbits goats sheep pigs cattle sick dogs cats in labor Travel exposure The germs that cause CAP exist everywhere in the world. But some regions are more likely to have certain germs. Experts know that travel to large gatherings abroad contributes to the spread of germs that cause CAP. Traveling, spending time on a cruise ship, or staying in a hotel can increase your risk of exposure to these germs. If you have symptoms of pneumonia, be sure to tell a doctor of any recent travel. It may help them make a diagnosis. symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia Pneumonia is a serious, sometimes fatal disease. The main symptoms of CAPT include: cough production of sputum fever difficulty breathing headache chest pain muscle aches irritability and restlessness (in infants) confusion (in older adults) In some people, breathing issues and fluid buildup in the lungs may become severe. This may lead to respiratory failure and the need for oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation. Diagnosis community-acquired pneumonia If a doctor notices you have symptoms of CAP, they will likely perform or order the following: Medical history: A doctor will ask about your medical history to better understand how you may have become ill. Physical exam: A doctor will perform a physical exam to check for fever and lung sounds consistent with pneumonia. Chest X-ray: A chest X-ray can show any fluid buildup or inflammation in the lungs. CT scan: A doctor might use a CT scan to confirm a diagnosis or rule out other conditions. CT scans may be more effective at detecting pneumonia than chest X-rays, but they are more expensive and take longer. Complete blood count (CBC): A CBC can help doctors see whether your immune system is fighting the infection. Electrolyte panel: An electrolyte panel can check your electrolyte levels as well as your kidney and liver function. Blood, sputum, or urine tests: Blood and sputum cultures, as well as urine antigen tests, may identify the exact cause of the infection, influencing treatment. Molecular testing: This is the standard way to test for viral pneumonia, such as cases caused by COVID-19. Research from 2020 has also shown that molecular tests, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, may also be better than cultures at detecting bacterial pneumonia. A doctor will also consider other potential diagnoses. Some illnesses with symptoms similar to CAP include: acute bronchitis or other respiratory infection chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) heart failure or heart attack pulmonary embolism (blood clot in your lung) tuberculosis Treatment for community-acquired pneumonia If you have CAP, your treatment plan will depend on your symptoms and the specific cause of your infection. A doctor will also consider how severe your symptoms are. According to 2017 research, 80% of people in the United States can treat CAP at home. If your doctor determines you have a milder case of CAP from bacteria, they may prescribe antibiotics for you to take at home. A doctor will likely prescribe one of the following: amoxicillin azithromycin clarithromycin doxycycline It’s important to take antibiotics as prescribed. If you don’t follow the proper regimen, the bacteria could become antibiotic resistant. If you have a more severe case of CAP, you may need to get treatment in a hospital. Healthcare professionals can provide a variety of intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatments based on your specific situation at a hospital. But antibiotics do not work for cases of viral pneumonia. You may need to let the virus run its course. In some cases, you may be able to use antiviral medication. Examples include: remdesivir (Veklury) for COVID-19 oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for influenza inhaled ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) There are other actions you can take to manage symptoms of viral CAP: Take over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to reduce fever. Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. Get enough rest to allow your body to recover. Quit smoking if you regularly smoke. If your symptoms are severe, you may need to go to the hospital. Additional treatments in the hospital may include: oxygen therapy intravenous (IV) fluids respiratory support with a ventilator Potential complications of community-acquired pneumonia With CAP comes the risk of possible complications. These are more likely if doctors don’t make a timely diagnosis or if initial treatments don’t work. Possible complications include: Pleural effusion: Pleural effusion is the buildup of fluid in your pleura, the space between your lungs and chest wall. Empyema: Empyema is the buildup of pus in the pleural space. Lung abscesses: An abscess is a pus-filled cavity that, in this case, forms in your lung. Sepsis: Sepsis is an extreme immune response to an infection. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): ARDS occurs when the lungs become severely inflamed and fill with fluid, preventing oxygen from getting into the blood. Complications like sepsis and ARDS can cause organ failure and death. Outlook for people with community-acquired pneumonia With rapid and appropriate treatment, many people fully recover from CAP without complications. Young people tend to recover fully more quickly. If CAP is due to bacteria, you may start to feel better within 5 to 7 days of starting antibiotics. Still, it can take months for all your symptoms to resolve. If you have a mild case of CAP, full recovery is possible with rest, antibiotics or antivirals, and sleep. More severe cases of CAP may require lengthy hospital stays to help keep you stable and aid recovery. For people admitted to intensive care, the death rate can be as high as 23%, according to 2021 research. Prevent community-acquired pneumonia Taking precautions against illness, such as getting an annual flu shot, can reduce your risk of CAP. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people ages 65 and older get a high dose flu vaccine. People over 65 can also consider getting the pneumococcal vaccine to prevent CAP. This is especially important if you have other health conditions or if you smoke. You may need a booster shot if you received your vaccine before age 65, or if you have a weakened immune system. Other everyday actions you can do to help prevent disease include the following: Wash your hands frequently, especially after using the bathroom or being in public. Cough into your elbow when you need to cough. Keep a physical distance from people who are ill. If you smoke or vape, consider quitting to reduce damage to your lungs. Such damage can make you more vulnerable to pneumonia infection. Epidemiology of Community-Acquired Pneumonia The incidence of CAP varies greatly from country to country. In the United States, CAP is estimated to occur in 649 of 100,000 adults annually, whereas a study from the Veterans Health Administration noted 472.2 cases per 100,000 person-years in 2017. Other countries report different frequencies, such as 8.1 per 10,000 in Vietnam and 31.2 per 10,000 in the United Kingdom. Rates also vary based on the population studied. In adults older than 65 years, 130.5 per 10,000 develop CAP in Malaysia, whereas 76.5 per 10,000 develop CAP in Germany. In individuals aged 85 years or older in Norway, the incidence of CAP is 172.4 per 10,000. Influenza and pneumonia combined remain in the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, ranking 9 of 10 in 2020. The combination was responsible for 1.6% (53,495) of deaths in 2020, an absolute increase of 7.5% from 2019 but a relative decrease due to the separately accounted deaths due to COVID-19, which ranked 3 of 10 at 10.3% (345,323) of all deaths. In addition, survivors of CAP have an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality risk for months to years after CAP. As many as 20% of CAP survivors have been shown to have cardiovascular events, and mortality is up to 30% 2 to 5 years after CAP. The cost of CAP has been examined in numerous studies. In a 2018 retrospective analysis of claims data for adults aged 65 years or older in a Medicare insurance plan, the rate of CAP was 846.7 per 100,000 person-years, which was greater than rates for myocardial infarction (405), stroke (278.9), and osteoporotic fractures (343.9). This study noted vaccinations against influenza and Pneumococcus infection cost $40 million; however, prevention for stroke and myocardial infarction cost more than $661 million. Age Advanced age is associated not only with a higher incidence of CAP but also with more severe disease, greater need for hospitalization, and higher mortality. A recent US study estimated 967,470 adults aged 65 and over are hospitalized annually from CAP with a 38% one-year mortality. CAP encountered in the ambulatory setting is more common among young adults, and is usually due to so-called atypical CAP pathogens (eg, Mycoplasma pneumoniae). Differential Diagnoses of Community-Acquired Pneumonia Aside from those mentioned above, the differential diagnoses to consider in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) include the following: Acute bronchitis Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis Aspiration pneumonitis Tracheobronchitis Myocardial infarction CHF and pulmonary edema Pulmonary fibrosis Sarcoidosis SLE pneumonitis Drug hypersensitivity reactions (nitrofurantoin, daptomycin) Drug-induced pulmonary disease (bleomycin, checkpoint inhibitors) Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia Pulmonary embolus or infarction Bronchogenic carcinomas Radiation pneumonitis Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) Lymphoma Vaccination Pneumococcal vaccines have been shown to have some efficacy in preventing vaccine-strain pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive disease. They have not been shown to prevent community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) of all kinds. Annual influenza vaccination has been shown to decrease pneumonia diagnoses, hospitalizations, and cardiac events in certain populations. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended in all persons older than 6 months. There are several options for vaccination, including standard-dose trivalent inactivated vaccine, high-dose inactivated trivalent vaccine, three different formulations of quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (egg-based, cell culture–based, and recombinant-derived), and a live attenuated influenza vaccine. Per current CDC recommendations, people with a history of egg allergy of any severity may receive any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate influenza vaccine. Individuals with a history of severe egg allergy should receive the vaccine under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of allergic conditions. People with a personal history of severe allergy to the flu vaccine should not receive it, and persons with history of Guillain-Barré syndrome should consult with their physician prior to being vaccinated. Four pneumococcal vaccines are approved in the United States : 15-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV15; Vaxneuvance) is approved for adults 18 years and older. 20-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV20; Prevnar 20) is approved for adults 18 years and older. 21-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV21; Capvaxive) 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax 23) is approved for adults aged 65 years or older and persons aged 2 years or older who are at an increased risk for pneumococcal disease. In October 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) approved the Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults Ages 19 Years or Older, United States, 2025.PCV21 now is listed as a vaccination option across all relevant sections of the notes. PCV21 includes 8 pneumococcal serotypes that are not present in PCV15, PCV20, or PPSV23. However, it lacks some serotypes, such as serotype 4, that are found in other pneumococcal vaccines. For routine vaccination, universal vaccination now is recommended for adults aged ≥50 years. For “special situations,” a risk-based vaccination recommendation is provided for adults aged 19–49 years. New details have been added about the use of pneumococcal vaccines during pregnancy and guidance for situations where PPSV23 is not available. The administration of pneumococcal vaccines is tailored based on an individual\\'s age, vaccination history, and specific health conditions. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends the following: Routine vaccination Adults aged 50 years and older should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine—either PCV15, PCV20, or PCV21. This recommendation applies to individuals who have not previously received any pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose vaccination history is unknown. For those administered PCV15, an additional dose of PPSV23 is required 1 year later to complete the pneumococcal vaccination series. This subsequent dose may be considered at a minimum interval of 8 weeks in specific clinical scenarios, such as patients with an immunocompromising condition, those with a cochlear implant, or individuals with a cerebrospinal fluid leak. If PCV20 or PCV21 is administered, no further vaccination with PPSV23 is indicated. For adults aged 65 years or older, shared clinical decision-making is recommended regarding pneumococcal vaccination. These patients may choose to receive PCV20 or PCV21, or opt out of additional pneumococcal vaccines if they have previously received PCV13 (but not PCV15, PCV20, or PCV21) at any age and PPSV23 at or after the age of 65. Adults under age 50 with a risk condition The CDC defines a risk condition as presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, chronic liver disease, cochlear implant, an immunocompromising condition (congenital or acquired asplenia/splenic dysfunction, immunodeficiency, conditions associated with immunosuppressive drugs or radiation therapy, HIV infection, hemoglobinopathy), or diabetes mellitus. Individuals who have never received a pneumococcal vaccine are administered 1 dose of either PCV15, PCV20, or PCV21. If PCV15 is selected, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year later, although this interval can be shortened to 8 weeks for adults with an immunocompromising condition, a cochlear implant, or a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Once this regimen is completed, the pneumococcal vaccination series is considered complete. For those who receive PCV20 or PCV21, no subsequent dose of PPSV23 is required, and the vaccination series is complete upon administration of either vaccine. Individuals who have previously received only PPSV23 should be given a dose of PCV15, PCV20, or PCV21 at least 1 year after their most recent PPSV23 vaccination. Following this, no additional dose of PPSV23 is recommended regardless of the vaccine used, completing their pneumococcal vaccination series. Those who have only received PCV13 should receive a dose of PCV20 or PCV21 at least 1 year after their most recent PCV13 vaccination, which completes their pneumococcal vaccination series. For patients who have received both PCV13 and 1 dose of PPSV23, the subsequent recommendations are contingent upon the individual\\'s risk condition. Patients with high-risk conditions such as an immunocompromising condition, a cerebrospinal fluid leak, or a cochlear implant should receive a dose of PCV20 or PCV21 at least 5 years after their most recent pneumococcal vaccination. This completes their pneumococcal vaccination series. For those with other risk conditions, no additional pneumococcal vaccines are recommended until the individual reaches at least age 50 years, at which time it is advisable to reassess the pneumococcal vaccine recommendations to ensure continued protection against pneumococcal disease. Pediatric Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) Treatment: Drugs and Side Effects 1. Amoxicillin (First-line antibiotic) Dosage: 80–90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily for 5 days (WHO recommendation) Typical max dose ~4,000 mg/day Use: Effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common bacterial cause in children. Side Effects: Diarrhea Rash (including mild hypersensitivity) Rarely allergic reactions (anaphylaxis very rare) Nausea or vomiting 2. Amoxicillin-Clavulanate Use: For children who received amoxicillin in past 30 days or suspected beta-lactamase producing organisms. Side Effects: Similar to amoxicillin but with higher risk of gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea, nausea). 3. Penicillin or Ampicillin (Parenteral) Use: Hospitalized children with severe pneumonia requiring IV antibiotics; often paired with gentamicin. Side Effects: Allergic reactions Injection site pain Gastrointestinal symptoms 4. Gentamicin (Parenteral) Use: Combined with penicillin for severe pneumonia. Side Effects: Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) Ototoxicity (hearing loss) especially with prolonged use or high doses Rare allergic reactions 5. Ceftriaxone (Second-line parenteral antibiotic) Use: For severe pneumonia not responding to first-line IV antibiotics. Side Effects: Diarrhea Allergic reactions Risk of biliary sludge (rare) 6. Macrolides (Azithromycin or Clarithromycin) Use: Target atypical pathogens like Mycoplasma pneumoniae, especially in school-age children and adolescents. Dosage: Azithromycin 10 mg/kg on day 1, then 5 mg/kg daily for 4 days (max 500 mg day 1, 250 mg days 2-5). Side Effects: Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) Risk of QT prolongation (heart rhythm irregularities) Potential drug interactions 7. Supportive Treatments Oxygen therapy for hypoxia. Antipyretics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) for fever. Fluids to prevent dehydration. Important Considerations: Duration of therapy: Typically 5 days for otherwise healthy children responding well to treatment; can be longer (7–10 days) in complicated or severe cases. Antibiotic choice depends on: Age Immunization status Severity of illness Local resistance patterns Recent antibiotic exposure MRSA coverage is reserved for complicated pneumonia or if risk factors present (e.g., clindamycin, vancomycin). PREDEFINED QUESTION AND ANSWER Q. What is pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)? A. It is a lung infection acquired outside of healthcare settings, caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, affecting the lungs of children. Q. What causes CAP in children? A. Viruses are the most common cause in infants and young children (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, influenza). In older children, bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae become more frequent causes. Q. What are the typical symptoms of CAP in children? A. Symptoms include cough, fever, rapid breathing (tachypnea), difficulty breathing, chest retractions, grunting, lethargy, and decreased appetite. Infants may present with nonspecific signs like poor feeding and irritability. Q. How is CAP diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is usually clinical, based on symptoms and physical exam findings such as crackles, decreased breath sounds, and retractions. Chest X-rays are mainly used for hospitalized or complicated cases. Tachypnea is a sensitive sign; WHO defines it differently by age group, e.g., >50 breaths/min in infants 2-12 months. Q. How is CAP treated? A. Most children with mild to moderate CAP are treated outpatient with oral antibiotics; high-dose amoxicillin is the first-line choice for bacterial pneumonia. Supportive care includes fever control, hydration, and monitoring. Hospitalized children may require oxygen and intravenous antibiotics. Q. When should a child be hospitalized? A. Hospitalization is considered for infants less than 3-6 months old, those with severe respiratory distress, hypoxia, dehydration, inability to take oral medication, or if social circumstances interfere with proper care. Q. Can CAP be viral, and do children always need antibiotics? A. Many cases, especially in young children, are viral and do not benefit from antibiotics. However, in practice, antibiotics are often started empirically due to diagnostic uncertainty and the risk of bacterial infection. Q. What are possible complications of CAP? A. Complications include pleural effusion, empyema (pus in the pleural space), abscess formation, respiratory failure, and sepsis, which are more common in severe or untreated cases. Q. How soon should symptoms improve with treatment? A. Improvement is typically expected within 48 to 72 hours of starting appropriate antibiotics. If symptoms worsen or persist, re-evaluation is necessary. Q. How can CAP be prevented in children? A. Vaccination (e.g., pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine, influenza vaccine), good hygiene, breastfeeding, and avoiding tobacco smoke exposure reduce risk. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION Doctor: Hello, I want to talk about your child’s diagnosis of pneumonia. Do you have any questions so far? Parent: Thanks, doctor. I’m worried. What exactly is pneumonia? Doctor: Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that causes inflammation and fluid buildup, making it harder for your child to breathe. It’s quite common in children and can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Parent: What caused my child’s pneumonia? Doctor: In young children, viruses often cause pneumonia, especially during cold or flu season. In older children, bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae or Mycoplasma pneumoniae can also cause pneumonia. We usually treat based on the likely cause. Parent: What symptoms should I watch for? Doctor: Common symptoms include cough, fever, fast breathing or difficulty breathing, chest pain, and sometimes less energy or poor appetite. In infants, signs can be subtle, like poor feeding or irritability. Parent: How is pneumonia treated? Doctor: Mild cases, especially viral ones, often improve with rest, fluids, and fever control at home. If bacteria are suspected, antibiotics like amoxicillin are used. We monitor closely and may adjust treatment if symptoms don’t improve. Parent: When would my child need to be hospitalized? Doctor: Hospital care is needed if your child is very young (under 3–6 months), has trouble breathing, low oxygen levels, dehydration, or other medical problems. Otherwise, many children get better comfortably at home. Parent: How long will recovery take? Doctor: Fever usually improves within a few days, but cough and tiredness may last 1 to 2 weeks or longer. It can take time for your child to fully recover energy and appetite. Parent: What can I do to help at home? Doctor: Make sure your child gets plenty of fluids and rest. You can use a cool-mist humidifier or gently tap their chest to help loosen mucus. Avoid smoke exposure and keep up with hand hygiene to prevent infections. Parent: Should my child get vaccines? Doctor: Yes, vaccines against pneumonia-causing bacteria and flu are very important to prevent future infections. We’ll check that your child’s vaccinations are up to date. Parent: When should I call you or seek emergency care? Doctor: If your child’s breathing worsens, they become very sleepy or irritable, have bluish lips or face, or can’t drink fluids, seek emergency care immediately. Also call if fever persists more than a few days despite treatment. Parent: Thank you, doctor. That helps me understand what to expect. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’re here to support you and your child through recovery. Please reach out with any questions.

It is characterized by the abnormal closure or narrowing of one or more bronchi, which can cause respiratory symptoms. In this article, we will discuss the causes, symptoms, and treatment of bronchial atresia. Causes: The exact cause of bronchial atresia is unknown. However, it is believed to be a congenital condition, meaning it occurs during fetal development. The abnormal closure or narrowing of the bronchi is thought to be caused by a failure of the bronchi to develop properly. Symptoms: Symptoms of bronchial atresia may vary depending on the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms may include: Shortness of breath Wheezing Recurrent respiratory infections Coughing Chest pain In some cases, bronchial atresia may be asymptomatic, and the condition may only be discovered incidentally on imaging studies. Treatment: Treatment for bronchial atresia depends on the severity of the condition and the symptoms present. In many cases, observation is sufficient, especially if the condition is asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, treatment may involve: Bronchodilator therapy: Medications that relax the muscles in the airways and improve breathing. Surgery: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected bronchi or to create an opening in the affected bronchi to improve airflow. Pulmonary rehabilitation: A program of exercise DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Congenital bronchial atresia (CBA): Characterized by a proximal bronchial interruption with mucus impaction (mucocele) distal to the atretic segment and hyperinflation of the affected lung parenchyma. Congenital lobar emphysema (Congenital lobar overinflation): A congenital overexpansion of a pulmonary lobe causing hyperlucency but without mucus plugging or a blind-ending bronchus. Bronchogenic cyst: A congenital cystic lesion of the bronchial tree that may cause localized mass effects without typical mucocele features. Pulmonary sequestration: Nonfunctioning lung tissue with anomalous systemic arterial supply, often intralobar or extralobar, which may mimic mucoid impaction and hyperinflation. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM / Congenital pulmonary airway malformation): A cystic lung lesion often detected prenatally or in infancy, distinct from bronchial atresia but sometimes coexisting. Mucoid impaction due to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) or cystic fibrosis: Both conditions lead to mucus plugging but usually accompanied by bronchiectasis and systemic symptoms. Acquired bronchial obstruction: Caused by foreign bodies, inflammatory strictures, tumors, or vascular anomalies compressing bronchi, which can mimic the appearance of atresia. Pulmonary embolism/infarction: Rare in children but may cause localized opacities and mimic segmental lung abnormalities. Lobar pulmonary hyperinflation secondary to airway obstruction (e.g., polyp, mucus plug): Collateral ventilation causes overinflation of lung segments like in bronchial atresia but usually lacks a blind-ending bronchus. EPIDEMIOLOGY Pediatric Bronchial Atresia Epidemiology: Congenital bronchial atresia (CBA) is a rare congenital abnormality of the tracheobronchial tree. Its estimated prevalence is 1 in 100,000 births. Key epidemiological features include: Rarity: CBA is considered uncommon. Studies often involve small numbers of patients, such as a review of 12 cases over 28 years in one hospital. In a study of congenital lung malformations in children, bronchial atresia accounted for 6.7% of cases, representing 2 out of 30 patients. Age at Diagnosis: While a congenital condition, CBA is infrequently diagnosed during childhood. Many cases, approximately two-thirds, are asymptomatic before diagnosis and are discovered incidentally on radiological imaging. When symptomatic, children may present with recurrent pneumonia or respiratory distress. A study showed children with CBA were aged 9, 10, and 11 years, while adults ranged from 25-74 years with a mean age of 37 years. Sex Predominance: There is a male predominance, with an estimated prevalence of 1.2 cases per 100,000 males and 0.6 cases per 100,000 females, leading to a male:female ratio of 2:1. Etiology: The exact cause is unknown, but it is hypothesized to be a focal bronchial interruption occurring before birth, possibly due to intrauterine ischemia after the 16th week of gestation. Prognosis and Recurrence: The condition has a high rate of perinatal mortality when detected prenatally. However, there is no increased risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. PREDEFINED QUESTION AND ANSWERS Q. What is bronchial atresia in children? A. Bronchial atresia is a rare congenital condition where a segment of a bronchus (airway) is absent or blocked, causing mucus to accumulate distally (forming a mucocele or bronchocele) and the affected lung segment to become overinflated (hyperlucent) due to trapped air. Q. What causes bronchial atresia? A. The exact cause is unknown. It is thought to result from a focal interruption in bronchial development during fetal life, possibly due to ischemic injury or a developmental defect occurring between weeks 4 and 16 of gestation. Q. How common is bronchial atresia in children? A. It is very rare, with an estimated occurrence of about 1 in 100,000 births. Many children are asymptomatic and the condition may be discovered incidentally on imaging done for another reason. Q. What symptoms do children with bronchial atresia have? A. Most children are asymptomatic, especially in early life. Some may have recurrent respiratory infections, cough, wheezing, or respiratory distress if complications occur. Q. How is bronchial atresia diagnosed? A. Diagnosis typically involves chest X-rays and high-resolution CT scans, which show a characteristic triad of findings: a blind-ending bronchus with a mucus-filled dilated segment (mucocele), surrounding hyperinflated lung tissue, and absence of normal bronchial continuity. Bronchoscopy may help confirm absence or atresia of the bronchus. Q. How is bronchial atresia treated? A. If asymptomatic, no treatment may be needed and observation is appropriate. Surgery, such as segmentectomy or lobectomy, is considered if there are recurrent infections, significant symptoms, or complications like lung destruction. Q. What is the prognosis for children with bronchial atresia? A. Prognosis is generally good for asymptomatic cases with appropriate monitoring. Surgical outcomes are typically favorable when intervention is needed. Q. Can bronchial atresia be detected before birth? A. Sometimes it is identified prenatally on ultrasound or fetal MRI as a cystic lung lesion or hyperinflation, but many cases are diagnosed postnatally during evaluation for respiratory symptoms or incidentally. Q. Are there other lung conditions similar to bronchial atresia? A. Yes, conditions such as congenital lobar emphysema, bronchogenic cysts, pulmonary sequestration, and congenital pulmonary airway malformation can present with overlapping imaging features and need differentiation. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION Doctor: Hello, I’d like to discuss the findings from your child’s recent chest imaging. We’ve identified a condition called bronchial atresia. Have you heard of this before? Parent: No, I haven’t. What is bronchial atresia? Doctor: Bronchial atresia is a rare congenital condition where part of one of the airways in the lung is blocked or ends abruptly. This causes mucus to build up in that segment, and the affected area of the lung beyond the blockage becomes overinflated because air can still get in through small collateral channels, but it can’t exit normally. Parent: That sounds serious. What symptoms does it cause? Doctor: Many children with bronchial atresia don’t have symptoms and the condition may be found incidentally on imaging done for other reasons. However, some children may have recurrent respiratory infections, cough, or difficulty breathing. Symptoms vary widely. Parent: What causes this to happen? Doctor: We don’t know the exact cause, but it likely occurs early during lung development before birth. Sometimes a part of the airway doesn’t form correctly or becomes blocked, which leads to the changes we see. Parent: How do you confirm the diagnosis? Doctor: We use chest CT scans to see the characteristic findings—the mucus-filled blind-ending airway and overinflated lung segment. Sometimes a bronchoscopy (looking into the airways with a camera) is done to further evaluate. Parent: What is the treatment? Doctor: If your child isn’t having significant symptoms or infections, we often manage it conservatively with close monitoring through periodic imaging and check-ups. If there are frequent infections, worsening breathing problems, or damaged lung tissue, surgery to remove the affected segment may be necessary. Parent: What is the outlook for my child? Doctor: The prognosis is generally good, especially if symptoms are mild or absent. Children who require surgery usually do well afterward. We will monitor your child regularly and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Parent: Should I watch out for anything specific? Doctor: Yes. If your child develops increased cough, fever, difficulty breathing, or other signs of infection, please seek medical attention promptly. Also, keep regular follow-up appointments to monitor lung function. Parent: Is this something that will improve over time or get worse? Doctor: It varies. Some children remain stable without symptoms for years. Others may experience complications that require intervention. Our goal is to support your child’s breathing and health to minimize problems. Parent: Thank you for explaining. I feel more confident knowing what to expect. Doctor: You’re welcome.

Patients with the disease experience bleeding into the lungs, resulting in recurrent episodes of shortness of breath and coughing, often with blood. The ongoing bleeding often leads to iron deficiency anemia, which causes fatigue and lack of growth in children. The disease injures the lungs, leading to inflammation and, in some people, irreversible scarring. Doctors use a flexible scope to access the lungs (bronchoscopy) and perform washing (bronchoalveolar lavage) to make the diagnosis. Sometimes, a lung biopsy could be necessary for a definite diagnosis. There is no known cure for IPH, and the prognosis is highly variable. The survival rate has improved over the past few decades as research and therapies improve. In the past, the average survival had ranged from 2.5 to 5 years after diagnosis. Standard therapies include steroids and immunosuppressants to help control the bleeding into the lungs, blood transfusions to correct the anemia and other supportive measures. Synonyms IPH immune-mediated pulmonary hemosiderosis (ImPH) diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage (DPH) Signs & Symptoms Some patients may not show any symptoms early in the disease, but the most common symptoms include: – Coughing with blood (hemoptysis) – Shortness of breath (dyspnea) – Long, unrelenting cough – Anemia (due to bleeding in the lungs and Iron deficiency) – Fatigue – Fever – Chest pain – Failure to thrive (deficient growth) – Enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) Causes The cause of IPH is still not known but it is considered to be an autoimmune disease. Many patients also have celiac disease, another autoimmune disease, and the combination of celiac disease and IPH is known as Lane-Hamilton syndrome. In most patients with Lane-Hamilton syndrome, eliminating gluten from the diet also improved the symptoms of IPH. The autoimmune hypothesis theorizes that the cells responsible for providing immunity are somehow responsible for causing bleeding into the lungs and irreversible scarring over time. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, scientists have hypothesized that the offending agents could be bioactive proteins (such as histamine, ECP or VEGF). When triggered by a yet to be discovered antigen(s), the immune cells are inappropriately activated, causing the release of these factors and prompting bleeding in the lungs. Some studies also suggest that IPH may have a genetic component because it has been reported in siblings and children of IPH patients. Moreover, patients with Down syndrome could be at a higher risk of developing IPH. Other research suggests there may be an environmental component to the disease, including secondhand smoking and mold exposure. More research is needed to evaluate these hypotheses. Due to the rarity of the disease, research can be difficult and take longer than other, more common diseases. Affected populations Approximately 80% of cases occur in children, mostly under 10 years old and 20% of cases occur in adults (majority under 30 years old). IPH may affect more girls than boys and more adult men than women, according to some studies. Disorders with Similar Symptoms The following conditions have signs and symptoms that are similar to IPH: Goodpasture syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung infections, systemic lupus erythematous, Henoch-Schoenlein purpura, ANCA vasculitis, and mixed connective tissue disease. Diagnosis Since it is a rare disease, diagnosing IPH involves ruling out all other possible causes of bleeding or scarring in the lungs. This may include various blood tests (iron studies, blood cell counts and antibody levels), sputum tests, imaging (x-rays, CT scans), bronchoscopy and biopsies. A multidisciplinary team is often involved and may include pulmonologists, hospitalists, rheumatologists, respiratory therapists, intensivists and thoracic surgeons. Early recognition and treatment can help avoid serious complications and disease progression. IPH is typically diagnosed using a camera (bronchoscope) that takes samples of the fluid in the lungs, known as a bronchoalveolar lavage. The pulmonologist will also take biopsies of the lungs to confirm the diagnosis under the microscope. Standard Therapies Treatment The goal of treatment is to suppress this immune response and decrease the damage by preventing repeated bleeding episodes. There is no gold standard treatment for IPH yet. Physicians determine the best therapies based on their experience and available research. Some commonly accepted therapies include: Steroids—These medications may control bleeding into the lungs and scarring that happens afterward. Immunosuppressants– In addition to steroids, these medications subdue the immune system further and assist in preventing bleeding in the lungs. These drugs may include 6-mercaptopurine/azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil or rituximab. Blood transfusions– Replacing the blood lost due to lung bleeding may help the symptoms of anemia. Stem cell transplant—This experimental therapy uses the body’s own stem cells to modulate the immune system and prevent bleeding. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)—This is a temporary life support system during acute severe bleeding or end-stage lung disease until a lung transplant can be accomplished for appropriate patients. Lung transplant—This is a final resort for severe IPH. IPH may recur in the transplanted lung, but few lung transplant cases have been reported. Differential Diagnosis of Pediatric IPH: Pulmonary Vasculitis / Capillaritis Syndromes Examples: Microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) Characterized by immune-mediated alveolar capillary inflammation causing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Usually accompanied by systemic symptoms and positive serologic markers (ANCA, anti-GBM antibodies). Autoimmune and Connective Tissue Diseases Systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic sclerosis can manifest with DAH. Often accompanied by other systemic signs and positive autoantibodies. Cardiac Causes Left-sided heart failure, mitral valve disease leading to pulmonary venous hypertension and hemorrhage. Infections Bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections causing pulmonary hemorrhage or secondary inflammation. Diagnosis aided by microbiological tests. Coagulopathies and Hematological Disorders Bleeding disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia, hemophilia), bone marrow failure, or malignancies. Lab tests include coagulation studies, bone marrow biopsy if indicated. Environmental / Toxic Exposures Inhalation of toxic agents, drugs causing lung bleeding. Foreign Body Aspiration or Trauma Especially focal hemorrhage, history of trauma or aspiration event. Pulmonary Hemosiderosis Secondary to Other Causes Secondary hemosiderosis due to recurrent bleeding from infections, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis. Idiopathic Pulmonary Hemosiderosis (IPH) Diagnosis of exclusion when no cause is found; characterized by repeated episodes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage leading to iron deficiency anemia and pulmonary infiltrates. Pediatric Idiopathic Pulmonary Hemosiderosis (IPH) Epidemiology: IPH is a rare but serious disease in children, with an estimated incidence of approximately 0.24 to 1.23 cases per million children per year. The condition typically presents in the pediatric age group more frequently than in adults but can occur at any age. IPH has a high mortality rate, reported around 50%, largely due to delayed diagnosis and progressive lung damage if untreated. The classical triad of presentations—hemoptysis, iron-deficiency anemia, and diffuse lung infiltrates—is often incomplete or absent in children early on, leading to diagnostic delays. There is some geographic variation reported but no clear gender predilection is consistently described. Early recognition and treatment with immunosuppression can improve outcomes, although prognosis remains guarded in severe cases. IPH may be associated with immune-mediated processes, and some pediatric patients also show coexisting conditions such as celiac disease (Lane–Hamilton syndrome) PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q. What is Idiopathic Pulmonary Hemosiderosis (IPH) in children? A. IPH is a rare lung disease characterized by recurrent episodes of bleeding into the lungs (alveolar hemorrhage) without an identifiable underlying cause, leading to iron deficiency anemia and lung infiltrates. Q. What causes IPH? A. The exact cause is unknown. Theories include autoimmune injury to the alveolar capillaries, allergic factors, environmental exposures, and possible genetic predisposition. It is considered idiopathic because no specific trigger is identified. Q. What are the common symptoms of pediatric IPH? A. Symptoms often include: Iron deficiency anemia (may be the initial or only sign) Recurrent cough and difficulty breathing (dyspnea) Repeated lung infiltrates visible on chest imaging Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) occurs in about half of cases but may be absent or unnoticed in young children who swallow sputum. Q. How is pediatric IPH diagnosed? A. Diagnosis involves: Clinical evaluation showing anemia and respiratory symptoms Chest X-rays or CT showing diffuse lung infiltrates Bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrating hemosiderin-laden macrophages (siderophages) Exclusion of other causes of alveolar hemorrhage such as vasculitis or infections Lung biopsy may be required if diagnosis is unclear Q. How common is IPH in children? A. IPH is very rare, with an incidence estimated at about 0.24 to 1.3 cases per million children annually. Q. What is the typical age of onset? A. Most children are diagnosed before the age of 10, often between 1 and 7 years old. Q. What is the prognosis of pediatric IPH? A. The disease course is variable; some children respond to treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, while others have recurrent hemorrhages leading to lung fibrosis. Early diagnosis and treatment improve outcomes, but mortality can be as high as 30-50% without intervention. Q. How is pediatric IPH treated? A. Systemic corticosteroids are the first-line therapy to control bleeding episodes. Immunosuppressive agents may be added if steroids alone are insufficient. Supportive care includes treating anemia and preventing infections. If celiac disease is present, a gluten-free diet may help. Q. What causes delays in diagnosis? A. IPH often presents insidiously, with anemia sometimes being the only sign initially. The classic triad of hemoptysis, anemia, and infiltrates is incomplete or absent early, especially in young children, leading to diagnostic delay averaging 1–3 years. Q. Are there any associated conditions? A. Some children with IPH have auto-immune markers or conditions such as celiac disease, suggesting autoimmune involvement. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION Doctor: Hello. I wanted to discuss your child’s recent diagnosis. After several tests and hospital admissions, we have identified that your child has idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, or IPH. Parent: I’m not familiar with that. What exactly is IPH? Doctor: IPH is a rare lung disease where there are repeated episodes of bleeding into the lungs. This bleeding leads to inflammation and causes symptoms like cough, breathing difficulties, and anemia because the blood loss reduces healthy red blood cells. Parent: What causes this bleeding? Is it our child’s fault or something serious? Doctor: The term ‘idiopathic’ means we don’t know the exact cause—it’s not related to infections, heart disease, or other conditions. It likely involves the immune system causing injury to the small blood vessels in the lungs. Parent: What symptoms should we expect, and what did we notice in our child? Doctor: Children with IPH often develop cough and shortness of breath. Sometimes they cough up blood, but younger children may swallow it, so it may go unnoticed. Your child has shown signs of anemia, which explains why they have been feeling tired and appearing pale. Parent: How do you diagnose it? Doctor: We use chest X-rays and CT scans showing abnormal lung infiltrates. A key test is bronchoalveolar lavage during bronchoscopy, where we sample lung fluid to look for special cells called hemosiderin-laden macrophages that indicate bleeding inside the lungs. We also rule out other causes like infections or autoimmune diseases before calling it idiopathic. Parent: What kind of treatment will my child need? Doctor: The main treatment is medications called corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation and stop the bleeding. In severe cases, high doses are given initially, followed by a maintenance dose. Some children may require other immunosuppressive medicines if steroids alone aren’t enough. Supportive care, such as oxygen and blood transfusions, may be needed during flare-ups. Parent: Is this a lifelong condition? Can it be cured? Doctor: IPH is chronic, so ongoing treatment and monitoring are necessary. While there’s no permanent cure, most children respond well to treatment, especially if started early. The goal is to prevent bleeding episodes and protect lung function. Parent: What should we watch for at home? When should we seek urgent care? Doctor: Watch for worsening cough, difficulty breathing, pale or blue lips, excessive tiredness, or coughing up blood. These signs need immediate medical attention. Also, keep all follow-up appointments and ensure your child gets routine vaccinations to prevent infections. Parent: Can infections make this worse? Doctor: Yes, respiratory infections can trigger flare-ups. Protecting your child with vaccines and good hand hygiene is very important. Parent: What is the usual outlook for children with IPH? Doctor: It varies, but with proper treatment, many children live healthy lives with few complications. Some might have recurrent flare-ups, so we need to be vigilant. We’ll guide you through managing this condition step by step. Parent: Thank you for explaining this. It’s a lot to take in, but I’m glad we know what’s going on. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’re here to support you and your child. Please don’t hesitate to ask any questions or reach out if you’re concerned.

This includes conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and other congenital or acquired lung diseases. WHO IS A PEDIATRIC PUMONOLOGIST A pediatric pulmonologist is a doctor who specializes in breathing and lung problems in children. They can help your child, and your family learn to manage the symptoms of breathing problems, prevent complications, and improve their quality of life. A pediatric pulmonologist will evaluate your child’s lung health, diagnose the cause of the breathing problem, and develop a treatment plan. What Does a Pediatric Pulmonologist Do? The pediatric pulmonologist will use a wide variety of tests. These include: Pulmonary function test to find out how well your child’s lungs are working. This is a set of painless measurements taken while your child does simple tasks like breathing out, walking, or riding a stationary bike. Allergy testing, bloodwork, or a chest X-ray to look for what’s causing your child’s symptoms. To help ease your child’s breathing symptoms, a pediatric pulmonologist can prescribe medication and/or treatments to be taken at home. These may include: Nebulizer treatments (your child will breathe in a mist that sends medicine directly to their lungs) Chest physiotherapy (a treatment that vibrates the rib cage to break up mucus in the lungs) CPAP and BiPAP (machines that use air to assist with breathing during sleep) Home oxygen or ventilator use for severe cases What Conditions Does a Pediatric Pulmonologist Treat? Pediatric pulmonologists see children with a broad range of breathing problems, from premature newborns with chronic lung disease to children with rare disorders like interstitial lung disease. Your child may need to see a pediatric pulmonologist because a part of their respiratory system (lungs, airway, nose, mouth, throat) developed in a way that makes it hard to breathe. Or the pulmonologist could be part of a medical team that treats your child for frequent aspiration (inhaling small amounts of food, drinks, saliva, or vomit) because of an aerodigestive disorder (a condition that affects your child’s airways and upper digestive tracts). In asthma, your child’s lungs and airway\\'s reaction to certain triggers by swelling and making extra mucus. This can cause wheezing, coughing, or difficulty breathing. Triggers vary but may include viruses (like colds or the flu), smoke, dust, mildew, pollen, animals, exercise, or stress. A pediatric pulmonologist can prescribe oral medications to help ease symptoms, provide inhalers and/or nebulizers that deliver medicine directly to the lungs, and order allergy testing to find out what’s triggering asthma flares. Apnea Short pauses in breathing can be normal for newborns. However, longer pauses are a concern. Infant apnea is a pause that lasts 20 seconds or longer (15 seconds in premature infants) or causes your baby’s heart rate to slow or their skin to turn pale or blue. Depending on the underlying cause, medication can sometimes help reduce the frequency of apnea. Your family can learn CPR and how to make your child’s surroundings safer. The doctor may prescribe an infant apnea monitor. It can alert you if your baby stops breathing. Most babies improve over time. They only need treatment until the apnea goes away. Sleep disorders Obstructive sleep apnea is a pattern of brief pauses in breathing because the airway collapses during sleep. Oxygen levels drop and your child wakes up just long enough to start breathing normally again. The child may not be aware that they’re waking during the night, but they might have trouble concentrating, behavior problems, or daytime sleepiness. Central sleep apnea occurs when your child stops breathing during sleep because their brain doesn’t cue their body to breathe. Pediatric pulmonologists can diagnose sleep disorders and, when needed, prescribe a CPAP or BiPAP machine to help your child breathe normally during sleep. Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that leads to the production of thick mucus, clogging airways and trapping germs in the lungs. As a result, children with CF may have frequent lung infections and trouble breathing. Treatments include inhaled medications and daily at-home therapy to break up mucus and clear airways. Procedures performed A pediatric pulmonologist performs procedures either to diagnose or treat the condition. These procedures may range from lung function test to sweat chloride test along with performing therapeutic procedures like chest physiotherapy. This is a glance at the procedures performed by them: Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy & bronchoalveolar lavage Bronchoscopy is a test to view the airways and diagnose lung disease. The flexible bronchoscope is inserted through the nose and goes into the throat and into the airways and lungs. Usually, an anesthetic will be sprayed to reduce any pain or uncomfortableness. Lung Function Test It is a series of breathing tests designed to measure the amount of air in the lungs, and how well the lungs function in moving air in and out of the lungs. These are easy, non-invasive and painless tests which require children to follow simple directions. Lung function tests include spirometry, body plethysmography, DLCO, exercise challenge test, methacholine challenge test, FeNO. Each exercise will be explained and demonstrated, and your child will be coached all through the way. Sweat Chloride test A sweat test measures the amount of chloride in the child’s sweat. It is the best way of checking for a health problem called cystic fibrosis (CF). In this test, a special machine is used to release sweat from the child’s forearm. The sweat is then tested in the lab to measure the chloride level. Skin prick allergy test A skin prick allergy test is used to find which allergy-causing substances (allergens) are causing allergy symptoms in your child. These tests may be able to confirm whether your child is allergic to a particular substance that he/she touches. In general, these tests are most reliable for diagnosing allergies to airborne particles such as pollen, pet dander and dust mites.

Bronchial Asthma A formal term emphasizing the involvement of the bronchi (airways). Allergic Asthma Asthma triggered primarily by allergens such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander. Non-Allergic Asthma Asthma triggered by factors other than allergens, such as cold air, exercise, or irritants. Exercise-Induced Asthma (EIA) or Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB) Asthma symptoms specifically triggered by physical activity. Cough-Variant Asthma A type of asthma where the main symptom is a persistent cough rather than wheezing or breathlessness. Occupational Asthma Asthma caused or worsened by workplace exposures to irritants or allergens. Intrinsic Asthma Asthma not linked to allergic reactions, often developing in adulthood. Extrinsic Asthma Asthma caused by external allergens, typically starting in childhood. DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma can\\'t be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it\\'s important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed. Types of asthma Types of asthma include: Allergic asthma: when allergies trigger asthma symptoms Cough-variant asthma: when your only asthma symptom is a cough Exercise-induced asthma: when exercise triggers asthma symptoms Occupational asthma: when substances you breathe in at work cause you to develop asthma or trigger asthma attacks Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS): when you have both asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Causes of asthma It isn\\'t clear why some people get asthma and others don\\'t, but it\\'s probably due to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors. Asthma triggers Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include: Airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste Respiratory infections, such as the common cold Physical activity Cold air Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) Strong emotions and stress Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat Risk factors of asthma Several factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. They include: Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis — which causes red, itchy skin — or hay fever — which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes Being overweight Being a smoker Exposure to secondhand smoke Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing Symptoms of asthma Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times — such as when exercising — or have symptoms all the time. Asthma signs and symptoms include: Shortness of breath Chest tightness or pain Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include: Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome Increasing difficulty breathing, as measured with a device used to check how well your lungs are working (peak flow meter) The need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations: Exercise-induced asthma, which may be worse when the air is cold and dry Occupational asthma, triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust Allergy-induced asthma, triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander) When to see a doctor for asthma Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Work with your doctor to determine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen — and when you need emergency treatment. Signs of an asthma emergency include: Rapid worsening of shortness of breath or wheezing No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity See your doctor: If you think you have asthma. If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from getting worse over time. To monitor your asthma after diagnosis. If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack. If your asthma symptoms get worse. Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn\\'t seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often. Don\\'t take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse. To review your treatment. Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments. Diagnosis and test of asthma Physical exam Your doctor will perform a physical exam to rule out other possible conditions, such as a respiratory infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Your doctor will also ask you questions about your signs and symptoms and about any other health problems. You may be given lung function tests to determine how much air moves in and out as you breathe. These tests may include: Spirometry. This test estimates the narrowing of your bronchial tubes by checking how much air you can exhale after a deep breath and how fast you can breathe out. Peak flow. A peak flow meter is a simple device that measures how hard you can breathe out. Lower than usual peak flow readings are a sign that your lungs may not be working as well and that your asthma may be getting worse. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to track and deal with low peak flow readings. Lung function tests often are done before and after taking a medication to open your airways called a bronchodilator (brong-koh-DIE-lay-tur), such as albuterol. If your lung function improves with use of a bronchodilator, it\\'s likely you have asthma. Other tests to diagnose asthma include: Methacholine challenge. Methacholine is a known asthma trigger. When inhaled, it will cause your airways to narrow slightly. If you react to the methacholine, you likely have asthma. This test may be used even if your initial lung function test is normal. Imaging tests. A chest X-ray can help identify any structural abnormalities or diseases (such as infection) that can cause or aggravate breathing problems. Allergy testing. Allergy tests can be performed by a skin test or blood test. They tell you if you\\'re allergic to pets, dust, mold or pollen. If allergy triggers are identified, your doctor may recommend allergy shots. Nitric oxide test. This test measures the amount of the gas nitric oxide in your breath. When your airways are inflamed — a sign of asthma — you may have higher than normal nitric oxide levels. This test isn\\'t widely available. Sputum eosinophils. This test looks for certain white blood cells (eosinophils) in the mixture of saliva and mucus (sputum) you discharge during coughing. Eosinophils are present when symptoms develop and become visible when stained with a rose-colored dye. Provocative testing for exercise and cold-induced asthma. In these tests, your doctor measures your airway obstruction before and after you perform vigorous physical activity or take several breaths of cold air. How asthma is classified To classify your asthma severity, your doctor will consider how often you have signs and symptoms and how severe they are. Your doctor will also consider the results of your physical exam and diagnostic tests. Determining your asthma severity helps your doctor choose the best treatment. Asthma severity often changes over time, requiring treatment adjustments. Asthma is classified into four general categories: Treatment of asthma Prevention and long-term control are key to stopping asthma attacks before they start. Treatment usually involves learning to recognize your triggers, taking steps to avoid triggers and tracking your breathing to make sure your medications are keeping symptoms under control. In case of an asthma flare-up, you may need to use a quick-relief inhaler. Medications for asthma The right medications for you depend on a number of things — your age, symptoms, asthma triggers and what works best to keep your asthma under control. Preventive, long-term control medications reduce the swelling (inflammation) in your airways that leads to symptoms. Quick-relief inhalers (bronchodilators) quickly open swollen airways that are limiting breathing. In some cases, allergy medications are necessary. Long-term asthma control medications, generally taken daily, are the cornerstone of asthma treatment. These medications keep asthma under control on a day-to-day basis and make it less likely you\\'ll have an asthma attack. Types of long-term control medications include: Inhaled corticosteroids. These medications include fluticasone propionate (Flovent HFA, Flovent Diskus, Xhance), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Pulmicort Respules, Rhinocort), ciclesonide (Alvesco), beclomethasone (Qvar Redihaler), mometasone (Asmanex HFA, Asmanex Twisthaler) and fluticasone furoate (Arnuity Ellipta). You may need to use these medications for several days to weeks before they reach their maximum benefit. Unlike oral corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids have a relatively low risk of serious side effects. Leukotriene modifiers. These oral medications — including montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo) — help relieve asthma symptoms. Montelukast has been linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away if you experience any of these reactions. Combination inhalers. These medications — such as fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair HFA, Airduo Digihaler, others), budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), formoterol-mometasone (Dulera) and fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (Breo Ellipta) — contain a long-acting beta agonist along with a corticosteroid. Theophylline. Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin, Theochron) is a daily pill that helps keep the airways open by relaxing the muscles around the airways. It\\'s not used as often as other asthma medications and requires regular blood tests. Quick-relief (rescue) medications are used as needed for rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma attack. They may also be used before exercise if your doctor recommends it. Types of quick-relief medications include: Short-acting beta agonists. These inhaled, quick-relief bronchodilators act within minutes to rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) and levalbuterol (Xopenex, Xopenex HFA). Short-acting beta agonists can be taken using a portable, hand-held inhaler or a nebulizer, a machine that converts asthma medications to a fine mist. They\\'re inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece. Anticholinergic agents. Like other bronchodilators, ipratropium (Atrovent HFA) and tiotropium (Spiriva, Spiriva Respimat) act quickly to immediately relax your airways, making it easier to breathe. They\\'re mostly used for emphysema and chronic bronchitis but can be used to treat asthma. Oral and intravenous corticosteroids. These medications — which include prednisone (Prednisone Inten sol, Rayos) and methylprednisolone (Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol) — relieve airway inflammation caused by severe asthma. They can cause serious side effects when used long term, so these drugs are used only on a short-term basis to treat severe asthma symptoms. If you have an asthma flare-up, a quick-relief inhaler can ease your symptoms right away. But you shouldn\\'t need to use your quick-relief inhaler very often if your long-term control medications are working properly. Keep a record of how many puffs you use each week. If you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often than your doctor recommends, see your doctor. You probably need to adjust your long-term control medication. Allergy medications may help if your asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies. These include: Allergy shots (immunotherapy). Over time, allergy shots gradually reduce your immune system reaction to specific allergens. You generally receive shots once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years. Biologics. These medications — which include omalizumab (Xolair), mepolizumab (Nucala), dupilumab (Dupixent), reslizumab (Cinqair), benralizumab (Fasenra) and tezepelumab (Tezspire) — are specifically for people who have severe asthma. Bronchial thermoplasty This treatment is used for severe asthma that doesn\\'t improve with inhaled corticosteroids or other long-term asthma medications. It isn\\'t widely available nor right for everyone. During bronchial thermoplasty, your doctor heats the insides of the airways in the lungs with an electrode. The heat reduces the smooth muscle inside the airways. This limits the ability of the airways to tighten, making breathing easier and possibly reducing asthma attacks. The therapy is generally done over three outpatient visits. Treat by severity for better control: A stepwise approach Your treatment should be flexible and based on changes in your symptoms. Your doctor should ask about your symptoms at each visit. Based on your signs and symptoms, your doctor can adjust your treatment accordingly. For example, if your asthma is well controlled, your doctor may prescribe less medication. If your asthma isn\\'t well controlled or is getting worse, your doctor may increase your medication and recommend more-frequent visits. Asthma action plan Work with your doctor to create an asthma action plan that outlines in writing when to take certain medications or when to increase or decrease the dose of your medications based on your symptoms. Also include a list of your triggers and the steps you need to take to avoid them. Your doctor may also recommend tracking your asthma symptoms or using a peak flow meter on a regular basis to monitor how well your treatment is controlling your asthma. Asthma Treatment Side Effects 1. Inhaled Corticosteroids (Preventers) Examples: Beclomethasone, Budesonide, Fluticasone Common Side Effects: Hoarse voice Sore mouth or throat Oral thrush (fungal infection) Prevention: Use proper inhaler technique Rinse and gargle mouth after use Use spacer devices to reduce oropharyngeal deposition Rare/Long-term Risks: Possible risk of osteoporosis with high-dose long-term use Increased risk of pneumonia or nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in older adults 2. Short-Acting Beta-2 Agonists (Relievers) Examples: Albuterol (Salbutamol), Levalbuterol Common Side Effects: Tremor or shakiness Rapid or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia, palpitations) Headache Throat or nasal irritation Muscle cramps Notes: Side effects often resolve quickly Overuse can worsen asthma control and increase sensitivity to triggers 3. Long-Acting Beta-2 Agonists (LABAs) Used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids for maintenance Side effects similar to short-acting beta-2 agonists but less frequent 4. Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists Example: Montelukast Possible Side Effects: Mood changes (anxiety, depression) Nightmares, sleep disturbances Note: Rare but serious neuropsychiatric effects reported, especially in children Report any behavioral changes to your doctor immediately 5. Anticholinergic Bronchodilators Examples: Ipratropium, Tiotropium Side Effects: Dry mouth Difficulty urinating (especially in patients with prostate issues) 6. Theophylline Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting Headache Insomnia Cardiac arrhythmias (at high doses) Seizures (rare) 7. Cromolyn Sodium (Mast Cell Stabilizer) Side Effects: Cough Throat irritation Rarely, headache or nausea Lifestyle and home remedies of asthma Although many people with asthma rely on medications to prevent and relieve symptoms, you can do several things on your own to maintain your health and lessen the possibility of asthma attacks. Avoid your triggers Taking steps to reduce your exposure to asthma triggers is a key part of asthma control. To reduce your exposure, you should: Use your air conditioner. Air conditioning reduces the amount of airborne pollen from trees, grasses and weeds that finds its way indoors. Air conditioning also lowers indoor humidity and can reduce your exposure to dust mites. If you don\\'t have air conditioning, try to keep your windows closed during pollen season. Decontaminate your decor. Minimize dust that may worsen nighttime symptoms by replacing certain items in your bedroom. For example, encase pillows, mattresses and box springs in dustproof covers. Avoid using down-filled pillows and blankets. Throughout the house, remove carpeting and install hardwood or linoleum flooring. Use washable curtains and blinds. Maintain optimal humidity. If you live in a damp climate, talk to your doctor about using a dehumidifier. Prevent mold spores. Clean damp areas in the bathroom, kitchen and around the house to keep mold spores from developing. Get rid of moldy leaves or damp firewood in the yard. Reduce pet dander. If you\\'re allergic to dander, avoid pets with fur or feathers. Having pets regularly bathed or groomed may also reduce the amount of dander in your surroundings. Clean regularly. Clean your home at least once a week. If you\\'re likely to stir up dust, wear a mask or have someone else do the cleaning. Wash your bedding regularly. Cover your nose and mouth if it\\'s cold out. If your asthma is worsened by cold or dry air, wearing a face mask can help. Stay healthy Taking care of yourself can help keep your symptoms under control, including: Get regular exercise. Having asthma doesn\\'t mean you have to be less active. Treatment can prevent asthma attacks and control symptoms during activity. Regular exercise can strengthen your heart and lungs, which helps relieve asthma symptoms. If you exercise in cold temperatures, wear a face mask to warm the air you breathe. Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight can worsen asthma symptoms, and it puts you at higher risk of other health problems. Control heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It\\'s possible that the acid reflux that causes heartburn may damage lung airways and worsen asthma symptoms. If you have frequent or constant heartburn, talk to your doctor about treatment options. You may need treatment for GERD before your asthma symptoms improve. Alternative medicine for asthma Certain alternative treatments may help with asthma symptoms. However, keep in mind that these treatments are not a replacement for medical treatment, especially if you have severe asthma. Talk to your doctor before taking any herbs or supplements, as some may interact with the medications you take. In most cases, more research is needed to see how well alternative remedies work and to measure the extent of possible side effects. Alternative asthma treatments include: Breathing exercises. These exercises may reduce the amount of medication you need to keep your asthma symptoms under control. Herbal and natural remedies. A few herbal and natural remedies that may help improve asthma symptoms include black seed, caffeine, choline and pycnogenol. Outlook / Prognosis of asthma Most people with asthma can manage their symptoms. Asthma management means you: Can do the things you want to do at work and home Have no (or minimal) asthma symptoms Rarely need to use your rescue inhaler Can sleep without asthma symptoms waking you up Don’t need oral steroids for flare-ups more than twice a year Some people can avoid triggers and have no symptoms most of the time. Others need to use a maintenance inhaler or other medications in addition to avoiding triggers. Kids may have fewer or no symptoms as they get older and their airways get bigger. You might be able to reduce or avoid asthma symptoms with a few everyday habits. These include: Avoid triggers whenever possible. It might be helpful to keep a symptoms journal to figure out what makes your symptoms worse. Be physically active to a level that’s right for you. Ask your provider what they recommend. A pulmonary rehabilitation program might help. Don’t smoke or vape. Let your provider know if you’re unable to use inhalers or take medication as prescribed. Diagnostic Considerations of asthma Vocal cord dysfunction or inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) Vocal cord dysfunction may exist alone or with asthma, it is caused by paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords during inspiration, and may disappear with panting, speech, or laughing. Patients with chronic symptoms suggestive of asthma, normal spirometry, poor response to asthma medications, and frequent evaluations should be evaluated for vocal cord dysfunction. Usually, the diagnosis can be made using direct laryngoscopy, but only during symptomatic periods or after exercise. The presence of flattening of the inspiratory limb of the flow-volume loop may also suggest vocal cord dysfunction, but this is only seen in 28% of patients at baseline. Tracheal and bronchial lesions A variety of airway tumors are reported to manifest with symptoms like those of asthma. These tumors include endobronchial carcinoid and mucoepidermoid tumors, as shown in the images below. In one case, a 14-year-old boy with hyperlucency in the left lung was ultimately found to have a bronchial carcinoid in the left mainstem bronchus. Other tracheal lesions can include bronchocentric granulomatosis, subglottic stenosis, subglottic web, tracheal hamartoma, bronchogenic cysts, leiomyoma, and tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica. All these types of tracheal lesions have been reported with symptoms similar to asthma. Foreign bodies Foreign body aspiration may cause not only localized wheezing but also generalized wheezing. Wheezing occurs in toddlers as well as in adults. As described in one patient, foreign body aspiration may necessitate bronchoscopic retrieval before the patient even recalls the inciting event, and as many as 25% of patients may never recall the event. Furthermore, aspirated foreign bodies may be radiolucent and therefore not be visible on a chest radiograph. Radiography may show unilateral hyperinflation (from air trapping), infiltrate (from occlusion of a bronchus), or may be normal. Pulmonary migraine Pulmonary migraine consists of combined recurrent asthma; cough with thick mucoid sputum; lower back pain radiating to the shoulder; subtotal or total atelectasis of a segment or lobe; and, occasionally, nausea with vomiting. The symptoms are often accompanied closely in time by focal headache. Spastic narrowing of the bronchi is postulated—along with retained mucous secretions, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and thickened bronchial walls—to cause expiratory collapse of selected airways. Cerebral and abdominal vascular migraine episodes are believed to accompany pulmonary migraine. Congestive heart failure Congestive heart failure causes engorged pulmonary vessels and interstitial pulmonary edema, which reduce lung compliance and contribute to the sensation of dyspnea and wheezing. Cardiac asthma is characterized by wheezing secondary to bronchospasm in congestive heart failure, and it is related to paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and nocturnal coughing. Diffuse pan bronchiolitis Diffuse pan bronchiolitis is prevalent in Japan and the Far East, and it may mimic bronchial asthma with wheezing, coughing, dyspnea on exertion, and sinusitis. High-resolution CT (HRCT) findings include centrilobular nodules and linear markings that usually are more profuse than the multifocal bronchiolar impaction sometimes observed with asthma. Aortic arch anomalies Aortic arch anomalies may occur later in adulthood. In one case, the anomalies, which simulated exercise-induced asthma, were noticed first in a young woman only after a vigorous exercise program. On testing, the flow-volume display of this patient suggested an intrathoracic obstruction. The patient had a right aortic arch with ligamentum arteriosum that extended anterior to the trachea. This condition caused constriction when increased pulmonary blood flow, oxygen demand, and tracheal airflow and decreased intratracheal pressure from downstream turbulence distal to the tracheal ring occurred with exercise; combined, these factors produced wheezing and dyspnea. Sinus disease Sinus disease, especially in children, is associated with bronchial asthma and wheezing. Although the association is not strong in patients with CT evidence of mild sinus mucosal thickening, a scoring system developed by Newman et al showed that extensive sinus disease was correlated with a substantially higher extent of wheezing than that in patients with only mild thickening. Of 104 adults, 39% had extensive disease, as visualized on CT scans, which was correlated with asthma and peripheral eosinophilia. Gastroesophageal reflux Cough, recurrent bronchitis, pneumonia, wheezing, and asthma are associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GER). The incidence of GER in patients with asthma ranges from 38% in patients with only asthma symptoms to 48% in patients with recurrent pneumonia. Scintigraphic studies performed after technetium-99m sulfur-colloid ingestion have shown radionuclide activity in the lungs the next day, but no causal relationship between reflux and asthma has been established. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that increased pulmonary resistance occurs with symptoms of reflux during acid provocation testing; as some have suggested, the changes may be sufficiently significant to produce clinically evident bronchoconstriction. Other conditions and factors Other extrinsic conditions, such as lymphadenopathy from sarcoidosis or Hodgkin lymphoma of the upper mediastinum, can contribute to asthma. In addition, aspirin or NSAID hypersensitivity and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome may be mistaken for asthma. Misdiagnoses as refractory bronchial asthma has resulted in inappropriate long-term treatment with corticosteroids. A significant history of smoking greater than 20-pack years should make the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) a stronger consideration than asthma. Consideration for alternative diagnoses should be given in all patients, and in particular in those older than 30 years and younger than 2 years with new symptoms suggestive of asthma. An absence of airway obstruction on initial spirometry findings should prompt consideration for alternative diagnoses and additional testing. Differential Diagnoses of asthma Allergic and Environmental Asthma Alpha1-Antitrypsin (AAT) Deficiency Aspergillosis Bronchiectasis Bronchiolitis Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic Sinusitis Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss Syndrome) Cystic Fibrosis Exercise-Induced Anaphylaxis Food-Dependent Exercise-Induced Anaphylaxis (FDEIA) Foreign Body Aspiration Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Heart Failure Pediatric Airway Foreign Body Pediatric Tracheomalacia Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary Eosinophilia Sarcoidosis Upper Respiratory Tract Infection Vocal Cord Dysfunction Wheat-Dependent Exercise-Induced Anaphylaxis (WDEIA) Epidemiology of asthma Asthma affects 5-10% of the US population or an estimated 25 million persons, including 4.7 million children. The overall prevalence rate of exercise-induced bronchospasm is 3-10% of the general population if persons who do not have asthma or allergy are excluded, but the rate increases to 12-15% of the general population if patients with underlying asthma are included. Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide. Annually, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 15 million disability-adjusted life-years are lost, and 250,000 asthma deaths are reported worldwide. In the United States, asthma prevalence, especially morbidity and mortality, is higher in blacks than in whites. Although genetic factors are of major importance in determining a predisposition to the development of asthma, environmental factors play a greater role than racial factors in asthma onset. A national concern is that some of the increased morbidity is due to differences in asthma treatment afforded certain minority groups. Larger asthma-associated lung function deficits are reported in Hispanics, especially females. Asthma is common in industrialized nations such as Canada, England, Australia, Germany, and New Zealand, where much of the asthma data have been collected. The prevalence rate of severe asthma in industrialized countries ranges from 2-10%. Trends suggest an increase in both the prevalence and morbidity of asthma, especially in children younger than 6 years. Factors that have been implicated include urbanization, air pollution, passive smoking, and change in exposure to environmental allergens. Asthma predominantly occurs in boys in childhood, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1 until puberty, when the male-to-female ratio becomes 1:1. Asthma prevalence is greater in females after puberty, and the majority of adult-onset cases diagnosed in persons older than 40 years occur in females. Boys are more likely than girls to experience a decrease in symptoms by late adolescence. Asthma prevalence is increased in very young persons and very old persons because of airway responsiveness and lower levels of lung function. Two thirds of all asthma cases are diagnosed before the patient is aged 18 years. Approximately half of all children diagnosed with asthma have a decrease or disappearance of symptoms by early adulthood RECENT GUIDELINE The 2024 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines categorize asthma severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Severity is assessed retrospectively from the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations, as follows: Mild asthma: Well-controlled with low-intensity treatment such as as-needed reliever medication alone or with low-intensity controller treatment such as low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) Moderate asthma: Well-controlled with low- or medium-dose ICS/long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) Severe asthma: Requires high-dose ICS/LABA to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled, or asthma that remains uncontrolled despite this treatment European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) guidelines on evaluation and treatment of severe asthma reserves the definition of severe asthma for patients with refractory asthma and those in whom response to treatment of comorbidities is incomplete. The 2022 GAN guidelines stress the importance of distinguishing between severe asthma and uncontrolled asthma, as the latter is a much more common reason for persistent symptoms and exacerbations, and it may be more easily improved. The most common problems that need to be excluded before a diagnosis of severe asthma can be made are the following: Poor inhaler technique Poor medication adherence Incorrect diagnosis of asthma, with symptoms due to alternative conditions such as upper airway dysfunction, cardiac failure, or lack of fitness Comorbidities and complicating conditions such as rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea Ongoing exposure to sensitizing or irritant agents in the home or work environment. Management Guidelines of asthma Management and Prevention\" include the following: Achieve and maintain control of asthma symptoms Maintain normal activity levels, including exercise Maintain pulmonary function as close to normal as possible Prevent asthma exacerbations Avoid adverse effects from asthma medications Prevent asthma mortality Stepwise pharmacologic therapy The pharmacologic treatment of asthma is based on stepwise therapy. Asthma medications should be added or deleted as the frequency and severity of the patient\\'s symptoms change. Step 1 for intermittent asthma is as follows: Controller medication not indicated Reliever medication is a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) as needed for symptoms Step 2 for mild persistent asthma is as follows: Preferred controller medication is a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid Alternatives include cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), or theophylline Step 3 for moderate persistent asthma is as follows: Preferred controller medication is either a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) (combination medication is the preferred choice to improve compliance) or an inhaled medium-dose corticosteroid Alternatives include a low-dose ICS plus either an LTRA or theophylline Step 4 for moderate-to-severe persistent asthma is as follows: Preferred controller medication is an inhaled medium-dose corticosteroid plus a LABA (combination therapy) Alternatives include an inhaled medium-dose corticosteroid plus either an LTRA or theophylline Step 5 for severe persistent asthma is as follows: Preferred controller medication is an inhaled high-dose corticosteroid plus LABA Step 6 for severe persistent asthma is as follows: Preferred controller medication is an inhaled high-dose corticosteroid plus LABA plus oral corticosteroid The 2024 GINA guidelines employ a stepwise, two track system depending on the choice of medications. For safety reasons, treatment with short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA) only is no longer recommended. To reduce risk of serious exacerbations and to control symptoms, all adults and adolescents with asthma should receive controller treatment containing inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). For mild asthma, as-needed low-dose ICS and low-dose formoterol are recommended. If formoterol is not available, the patient should take low-dose ICS whenever SABA is taken. ICS-containing treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after asthma diagnosis. Asthma medications should be added or deleted as the frequency and severity of the patient\\'s symptoms change. Track 1 is the preferred management approach with low dose ICS-formoterol taken at any step when the patient is symptomatic. The steps are as follows: Step 1-2: As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol Step 3: Daily low-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever Step 4: Daily medium-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever Step 5: Refer for expert investigation and add-on LAMA treatment The Track 2 approach is the alternative if Track 1 is not possible, or if a patient is stable, with good adherence and no exacerbations in the past year on their current therapy. The steps are as follows: Step 1: As-needed SABA and a low dose ICS are taken together (in combination, or with the ICS taken right after the SABA) Step 2: Daily low-dose ICS as maintenance plus as-needed SABA as reliever Step 3: Daily low-dose ICS-LABA as maintenance plus as-needed SABA as reliever Step 4: Medium- to high-dose ICS-LABA as maintenance plus as-needed SABA as reliever Step 5: Refer for expert investigation and add-on LAMA treatment For severe allergic asthma, a therapeutic trial of omalizumab Do not use methotrexate or macrolide antibiotics to treat severe asthma For severe asthma and recurrent exacerbations of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), antifungal agents should be given Do not use antifungal agents for severe asthma without ABPA irrespective of sensitization to fungi (ie, positive skin prick test or fungus-specific immunoglobulin E in serum) Diagnosis The JSA recommends spirometry for assessing the extent of airflow limitation or airway reversibility. The JSA recommends daily measurement of peak expiratory flow for unstable asthma and patients lacking obvious dyspnea during attack. Although useful for diagnosing asthma, the JSA does not recommend assessing bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients with low FEV1 (≤1 L) or low %FEV1 (≤50%) since excess airway narrowing may occur due to irritant inhalation. Treatment of long-term adult asthma The JSA recommends using a jet nebulizer for budesonide (BUD) inhalation suspension. The JSA recommends adding one or more agents other than inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), as opposed to increasing the dose of an ICS, to control asthma. The JSA recommends long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), sustained-release theophylline, and long-acting muscarinic antagonists as add-on drugs. The JSA recommends that anti-immunoglobulin E antibodies and other biologics as well as oral steroids be reserved for very severe and persistent asthma related to allergic reactions. The JSA recommends inhaled β2-agonists, aminophylline, corticosteroids, adrenaline, oxygen therapy, and other approaches be used as needed during acute exacerbations. Treatment during pregnancy The JSA recommends ICSs as first-line treatment for long-term management of pregnant women with asthma. The JSA recommends a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) as needed for pregnant women with mild intermittent asthma. The JSA recommends low-dose ICS; LTRA, controlled-release theophylline, and/or disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) as needed in pregnant women with mild persistent asthma. The JSA recommends low-dose ICS and LABA or moderate-dose ICS and LABA in combination with LTRA or controlled-release theophylline as needed in pregnant women with moderate persistent asthma. The JSA recommends high-dose ICS and LABA; oral steroids as needed for pregnant women with severe persistent asthma. Exercise-Induced Asthma Guidelines Guidelines for the management of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), which included the following recommendations: Administration of an inhaled SABA before exercise (strong recommendation); the SABA is typically administered 15 minutes before exercise A controller agent is added whenever SABA therapy is used daily or more frequently Interval or combination warm-up exercise before planned exercise (strong recommendation) Recommend against daily use of an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist as single therapy (strong recommendation) For patients who continue to have symptoms despite using an inhaled SABA before exercise or who require an inhaled SABA daily or more frequently: (1) Daily ICS (strong recommendation), (2) Daily administration of an LTRA (strong recommendation), (3) Administration of a mast cell‒stabilizing agent before exercise (strong recommendation), and (4) Inhaled anticholinergic agent before exercise (weak recommendation) For patients with EIB and allergies who continue to have symptoms despite using an inhaled SABA before exercise or who require an inhaled SABA daily or more frequently consider administration of an antihistamine (weak recommendation) For exercise in cold weather, routine use of a device (eg, mask) that warms and humidifies the air during exercise (weak recommendation) GENOMIC DATA FOR ASTHMA Key genomic findings include variants in genes such as: IL1RL1, IL33, HLA-DQA1, GSDMB, FLG, TSLP, STAT6, and SMAD3, among others, which are associated with asthma risk, age of onset, and severity. These genes often relate to immune system regulation, airway epithelium function, and inflammatory pathways, highlighting the immune system\\'s critical role in asthma pathogenesis. Recent whole-genome sequencing studies focusing on moderate-to-severe asthma have shown that genetic risk correlates with lung function measures and that different genetic components contribute independently to asthma susceptibility. Despite these advances, the known genetic variants explain only a portion of asthma heritability, prompting ongoing research integrating multiomics data to better understand asthma\\'s genetic architecture and improve personalized diagnosis and treatment PREDEFINED QUESTION AND ANSWERS FOR ASTHMA For asthma, some basic questions to ask your doctor include: Is asthma the most likely cause of my breathing problems? If you are experiencing breathing problems, asthma is a common and likely cause, but it is important to confirm this with proper evaluation because other conditions can cause similar symptoms Other than the most likely cause, what are other possible causes for my symptoms? Other Possible Causes of Breathing Problems Respiratory infections (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Allergies or allergic reactions Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Heart conditions Anxiety or panic disorders Structural abnormalities in the lungs or airways What kinds of tests do I need? To diagnose asthma and rule out other causes, your doctor will likely recommend: Physical exam and medical history review to assess symptoms and possible triggers. Lung function tests (spirometry): Measures airflow and how well your lungs work before and after using a bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol). Improvement after bronchodilator use supports asthma diagnosis. Peak flow measurement: A simple test to measure how hard you can breathe out, useful for monitoring asthma. Methacholine challenge test: If initial tests are inconclusive, this test uses a known asthma trigger to assess airway sensitivity. Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) test: Measures airway inflammation linked to asthma. Allergy testing: To identify potential triggers. Imaging tests (chest X-ray or CT scan): To rule out infections or other lung diseases. Blood tests: To check for markers of inflammation or allergic responses Is my condition likely temporary or chronic? Asthma is generally a chronic condition that can be managed but not cured. Symptoms may vary over time, with periods of control and flare-ups. Some breathing problems may be temporary if caused by infections or allergies, but asthma tends to be persistent What\\'s the best treatment? Inhaled corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation (mainstay of asthma control). Bronchodilators (short acting like albuterol) for quick relief of symptoms. Long-acting bronchodilators or combination inhalers for persistent asthma. Avoidance of known triggers such as allergens, smoke, or irritants. Your doctor will develop an asthma action plan tailored to your symptoms and severity What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you\\'re suggesting? Leukotriene modifiers (oral medications) Biologic therapies for severe asthma (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) Allergy immunotherapy if allergies are a significant trigger Lifestyle modifications including breathing exercises and avoiding triggers I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together? If you have other health issues, coordinate care with your healthcare provider to avoid drug interactions and overlapping symptoms. For example, GERD can worsen asthma symptoms and may need simultaneous treatment Are there any restrictions that I need to follow? Avoid known asthma triggers (smoke, allergens, pollution) Follow your medication regimen strictly Avoid strenuous exercise if it triggers symptoms unless managed with pre-exercise medication Smoking cessation if applicable Should I see a specialist? Seeing a pulmonologist or allergist is recommended if diagnosis is uncertain, symptoms are severe, or asthma is difficult to control Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you\\'re prescribing me? Many asthma medications, including inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators, have generic versions available. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about generic options to reduce cost Doctor patient conversation of asthma Doctor: Good morning! What brings you in today? Patient: Hi, I’ve been having trouble breathing lately, especially at night and when I exercise. I also cough a lot sometimes. Doctor: I see. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms? Patient: It’s been a few months now, but it’s getting worse. Doctor: Do you notice if anything triggers your symptoms? Like dust, cold air, or exercise? Patient: Yes, cold weather and running seem to make it worse. Doctor: Have you used any inhalers or medications for this? Patient: I tried using an over-the-counter inhaler a couple of times, but it didn’t help much. Doctor: Okay. Based on what you’re describing, asthma is a possibility. It’s a condition where your airways become inflamed and narrow, making it harder to breathe. We’ll do some tests to confirm. Patient: What kind of tests? Doctor: We’ll start with spirometry, which measures how well your lungs are working. It’s a simple breathing test. Sometimes we also do a test to see how your lungs respond to medication. Patient: Is asthma permanent? Will I have this forever? Doctor: Asthma is usually a chronic condition, meaning it tends to last a long time, but with proper treatment, most people can control their symptoms and live normal lives. Patient: What treatments are available? Doctor: The main treatments are inhalers. There are two types: one for quick relief when you have symptoms, and another you use daily to reduce inflammation and prevent attacks. We’ll find the right combination for you. Patient: Are there side effects? Doctor: Inhaled medications are generally safe. Some people notice mild throat irritation or hoarseness, but serious side effects are rare. We’ll monitor you closely. Patient: Should I avoid anything? Doctor: Yes, try to avoid your triggers like cold air and strenuous exercise without proper warm-up or medication. Also, avoid smoke and allergens if possible. Patient: I also have allergies and acid reflux. Will that affect my asthma? Doctor: Yes, allergies can worsen asthma, and acid reflux can sometimes trigger symptoms. Managing those conditions alongside asthma is important. Patient: Do I need to see a specialist? Doctor: For now, we can start treatment here. If your symptoms don’t improve or are severe, I may refer you to a pulmonologist or allergist. Patient: Are there generic options for inhalers? I’m worried about the cost. Doctor: Yes, many inhalers have generic versions. We’ll choose medications that fit your budget. Doctor: I’ll give you some brochures about asthma and websites you can visit for more information. Do you have any other questions? Patient: Not right now. Thank you! Doctor: You’re welcome! Let’s schedule your lung function test and a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you’re doing.

Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS) A condition similar to RAD but typically refers to asthma-like symptoms following a single, high-level exposure to irritants. Bronchial Hyperreactivity Describes increased sensitivity of the airways, a hallmark of RAD and asthma. Asthma-like Syndrome A descriptive term used when symptoms resemble asthma, but a formal diagnosis is pending. Transient Wheezing Refers to temporary episodes of wheezing that may be labeled as RAD in infants or toddlers. Presumptive Asthma Sometimes used when RAD is considered a preliminary diagnosis before confirming asthma. DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF REACTIVE AIRWAY DISEASE “Reactive airway disease” (RAD) is a term that healthcare providers use to describe breathing symptoms that are similar to asthma, but they’re not sure of the exact cause. Your symptoms develop when the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs (bronchial tubes) swell, which causes narrowing of them. This makes it difficult for air to move into and out of your lungs, resulting in difficulty breathing. Reactive airway disease isn’t the same as reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS). The names, acronyms and symptoms are similar, but it’s important to keep them separate. RAD isn’t an official clinical diagnosis, and it doesn’t have a precise definition. There’s controversy in the medical community over its use because some providers use the terms RAD and asthma interchangeably, but they don’t have the same meaning. Its use should be limited to being a placeholder term until providers can make an official diagnosis. Symptoms of reactive airway disease Reactive airway disease symptoms include: Chronic cough that clears mucus (sputum) from your airways. Shortness of breath (dyspnea). Difficulty breathing. Wheezing. Chest tightness. If a provider describes your condition as RAD, your chest may feel tight and it may be difficult to breathe. CAUSES OF REACTIVE AIRWAY DISEASE The following may trigger symptoms that healthcare providers label as RAD: Allergies. Bacterial infections. Viral infections. Chemical gases, perfumes or fumes. Smoke. Exercise. Cold air, hot air, humidity or changes in the weather. How long can reactive airway disease last? It depends on the underlying cause of your symptoms. Once a healthcare provider makes an official diagnosis, they can prescribe medicine or recommend treatment to relieve your symptoms. They’ll detail when you can expect to feel better. Does reactive airway disease go away? It depends on the cause. Talk to a healthcare provider about your symptoms. They can give you an idea of what to expect after making an official diagnosis. Who does reactive airway disease affect? A healthcare provider may use the term reactive airway disease for anyone who has breathing problems without a clear cause. However, providers are most likely to describe breathing and airway symptoms as RAD in infants and children who are too young to take a lung function test. Diagnosis and Tests of reactive airway disease Talk to a healthcare provider if you or your child have symptoms that affect your breathing or if you have a cough that won’t go away. They’ll ask you about your symptoms and medical history. They’ll also conduct a physical examination. During the physical exam, they’ll listen to your lungs with a stethoscope (auscultation). A stethoscope is a medical device with a small, metal disc (diaphragm) that connects to earpieces with rubber tubing. They’ll also order tests to help them confirm their diagnosis. To help determine the cause of your breathing problems, a healthcare provider may order the following tests: Spirometry: Spirometry is a common lung function test that measures how much air goes into and out of your lungs when you breathe. Imaging tests: Imaging tests are painless, noninvasive tests that help a provider take a closer look at your lungs, heart and bones. They may order a chest X-ray, echocardiogram (echo) or CT (computed tomography) scan. Blood tests: During a blood test, a provider will use a small needle (about the size of a standard earring post) to withdraw a small amount of blood. They’ll look at your blood under a microscope to see if you have any signs of an infection, allergies or inflammation. Skin (scratch) prick test: During a skin prick test, a provider will scratch small areas of your skin with different allergens to test for allergies. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG): An electrocardiogram checks how well your heart works. A provider may order this test to rule out heart disease as a cause of shortness of breath. Pulse oximetry: Pulse oximetry measures how much oxygen is in your blood. Exercise testing: Exercise testing measures whether your blood oxygen levels decrease when you exercise. Management and Treatment of reactive airway disease Reactive airway disease treatment depends on an official diagnosis. In an emergency setting, providers may use: Bronchodilators: Bronchodilators (inhalers) help relax your airways. Providers commonly prescribe bronchodilators to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oxygen therapy: Oxygen therapy helps give your body oxygen when you’re having a hard time breathing. Epinephrine injection: Providers may give an epinephrine injection if you have a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or asthma attack. Corticosteroids (steroids): Steroids help reduce inflammation in your lungs. Providers commonly provide steroids to treat asthma, COPD or allergies. Does albuterol help reactive airway disease? It depends. Albuterol (Accuneb®) is a type of bronchodilator that helps open up your airways if you have asthma, COPD and exercise-induced bronchospasm. It may not treat other RAD causes. Common Medications for Reactive Airway Disease Oxygen therapy: In severe cases with low oxygen levels. Epinephrine injection: Used in emergency situations such as severe airway constriction or anaphylaxis. Immunotherapy: For allergic triggers contributing to RAD. Side Effect Considerations Inhaled corticosteroids are generally safe but require rinsing the mouth after use to prevent fungal infections. Oral steroids are effective but should be used for short periods due to systemic side effects. Bronchodilators can cause jitteriness or increased heart rate, especially if overused. Montelukast has rare reports of mood or behavioral changes; monitor accordingly. Non-Pharmacological Management Avoidance of triggers (allergens, smoke, irritants) Breathing exercises and pulmonary rehabilitation Lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise Outlook / Prognosis Reactive Airway Disease If a healthcare provider says you have RAD, it means you have breathing problems, but they aren’t sure of the cause. They’ll conduct a physical exam and tests to help determine the cause of your breathing issues so you can get proper treatment. They may also refer you to a healthcare provider who specializes in conditions that affect your lungs (pulmonologist). If a healthcare provider describes your symptoms as RAD, your treatment, recovery and management depend on an official diagnosis. Some conditions are treatable, while others may progressively get worse. Prevention of Reactive Airway Disease The best way to lower your risk of RAD is to: Avoid known allergens or other triggers. Take medicines that prevent your airways from swelling. Quit smoking. Wear a mask or other respiratory protection while handling chemicals. When should I see my healthcare provider? See your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of reactive airway disease or if your symptoms don’t improve with treatment. Call your local emergency number or get to an emergency room right away if you’re using a lot of energy to breathe (severe respiratory distress), aren’t responding to breathing treatments, have low oxygen levels or notice anaphylaxis symptoms, including: Difficulty breathing. Drop in blood pressure. Swollen lips. Sudden weakness. Fainting (syncope). Confusion. Diagnostic Considerations of Reactive Airway Disease The clinical diagnosis of asthma in children aged 5 years or younger is often based on symptoms during and between viral respiratory tract infections. The symptom pattern is as follows: Cough, wheeze, and heavy breathing for more than 10 days during upper respiratory tract infections More than three episodes per year or severe episodes and/or night worsening Cough, wheeze, or heavy breathing during play or when laughing, between episodes Allergic sensitization, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, or family history of asthma Differential Diagnoses of Reactive Airway Disease Anaphylaxis Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Emergent Management of Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis) Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Pediatric Anaphylaxis Pediatric Epiglottitis Pediatric Foreign Body Ingestion Pediatric Pneumonia Epidemiology of Reactive Airway Disease United States statistics Pediatric asthma is a chronic, multifactorial, lower airway disease that affects 5-15% of children (2.7 million children in the United States alone). In the United States, approximately one half of all emergency department (ED) and clinic visits for asthma are children younger than 18 years. ED visits peak in the fall, whereas school holidays disrupt the spread of infections, resulting in a subsequent decrease in ED visits and hospitalizations. Status asthmaticus appears to be on the rise; several retrospective studies reflect an increase in hospital admissions, particularly in those younger than 4 years. Fewer hospital and ED visits occur in children using inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Asthma prevalence appears to be increasing worldwide. Air pollutants may play a role in the prevalence increase. Higher prevalence occurs in poverty stricken urban areas where children are less likely to have routine doctor visits and readily available access to medications. A correlation may exist between high levels of exposure to cockroach allergen and the frequency of asthma-related health problems in inner-city children. Homes in poverty areas were more likely to have high cockroach allergen levels. Asthma may develop in children from early exposure to cockroach allergen. An association may exist between obesity and childhood asthma. Increased resisting, an adipokine produced by adipose tissue, may play a negative predictive role in asthma. An algorithm has been developed to determine the risk factors for developing persistent asthma symptoms among children younger than 3 years of age who had 4 or more episodes of wheezing during the previous year. The Asthma Predictive Index included either (1) one of the following: parental history of asthma, a physician diagnosis of atopic dermatitis, or evidence of sensitization to aeroallergens; or (2) two of the following: evidence of sensitization to foods, ≥4% peripheral blood eosinophilia, or wheezing apart from colds. International statistics Worldwide, the prevalence of asthma is increasing. Asthma is more common in Western countries than in developing countries. Asthma is more prevalent in English-speaking countries. Prevalence increases as a developing country becomes more Westernized and urbanized. Race-, sex-, and age-related demographics Reactive airway disease is more common in Black and Hispanic children; hospitalization rates in African Americans are 4 times greater than in the White population. A correlation may exist between high levels of exposure to cockroach allergen and the frequency of asthma-related health problems in inner-city children. No correlation exists between education levels from a retrospective review. The male-to-female ratio is 1.5:1. The peak prevalence of asthma is in those aged 6-11 years. Impact of COVID-19 on pediatric asthma exacerbation Pediatric asthma attacks decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, probably because of reduced environmental allergen exposure and decreased risk of other viral respiratory tract infections. Asthma is not considered to be a risk factor for COVID-19 severity. Procedures of Reactive Airway Disease Procedures include the following: Spirometry (decreased forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]) Bedside spirometry is the primary procedure for children with RAD who are older than 5 years. Patients with decreased FEV1 require further evaluation and treatment. A barium swallow may be indicated to determine any esophageal, pulmonary, or vascular pathology, particularly a tracheoesophageal fistula. Bronchoscopy (rarely indicated) (see Table 1 below) Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is the most common form of pulmonary function test monitoring. Record the best of 3 attempts. Possible life-threatening asthma exacerbation with PEF predicted of less than 30%; severe exacerbation, with less than 50%; and moderate exacerbation, with less than 80%. Peak flow rates are described in the table below. Table 1. Peak Flow Rates in Liters per Minute RECENT GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATION OF Reactive Airway Disease Recommendations include the following: The ERS recommends spirometry as first-line diagnosis in children aged 5-16 years with suspected asthma. ERS recommends bronchodilator reversibility testing as first-line diagnosis in all children with FEV1 < LLN or < 80% predicted and/or FEV1/FVC < LLN or < 80% predicted. ERS recommends FeNO as first-line diagnosis in children aged 5-16 years with suspected asthma. ERS recommends against PEFR variability testing as the primary objective test on its own to diagnose asthma in children aged 5-16 years. ERS recommends against diagnosing asthma in children aged 5-16 years based on clinical history alone or following a single abnormal objective test. ERS recommends against using an improvement in symptoms after a trial of preventive medication alone to diagnose asthma in children aged 5-16 years. ERS recommends against using skin prick tests as diagnostic tests for asthma in children aged 5-16 years. ERS recommends a direct bronchial challenge test using methacholine in children aged 5-16 years with suspected asthma where asthma diagnosis could not be confirmed with first-line tests. ERS recommends an indirect bronchial challenge test using a treadmill or a bicycle in children aged 5-16 years with suspected asthma with exercise-related symptoms where asthma diagnosis could not be confirmed with first-line tests. PREDEFINED Questions and answers for Reactive Airway Disease What is the difference between reactive airway disease and asthma? People sometimes use the terms “reactive airway disease/RAD” and “asthma” interchangeably, but they don’t have the same meaning. Asthma is a chronic condition that irritates and narrows your airways. It may also cause extra mucus production. Reactive airway disease is a placeholder term providers use to indicate that something is affecting your airways, but they aren’t sure of the exact cause. Is reactive airway disease the same as COPD? Healthcare providers may sometimes describe COPD symptoms as reactive airway disease. But they’re not the same. COPD is an umbrella term for chronic (long-lasting) lung conditions that affect your ability to breathe and progressively get worse. Providers may describe a condition — including COPD — as RAD until they can make an official diagnosis. 1. What’s causing my reactive airway disease? RAD is caused by overreaction of your bronchial tubes to various irritants or triggers, leading to swelling and narrowing of the airways. Common causes include: Allergens such as pet hair, pollen, mold, dust Respiratory infections, especially viral infections like RSV Environmental irritants like smoke, strong odors, perfumes, chemical fumes Exercise, stress, and changes in weather or temperature Children with a family history of asthma or prior lung infections are at higher risk. 2. Is there a cure for my condition? Reactive Airway Disease is generally considered a transient or temporary condition, especially in young children, and not a formal diagnosis like asthma. It may improve or resolve over time, particularly if triggers are avoided and infections are managed. However, RAD can sometimes progress to chronic asthma, which currently has no cure but can be effectively controlled with treatment. 3. How can I improve my breathing? Avoid known triggers such as smoke, allergens, strong odors, and cold air. Use prescribed medications regularly to reduce airway inflammation and prevent attacks. Manage respiratory infections promptly. Practice breathing exercises and maintain good overall lung health. Follow your doctor’s asthma or RAD action plan closely. 4. What medications do you recommend? Typical medications used include: Short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) for quick relief of symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation and prevent flare-ups. In some cases, leukotriene modifiers or combination inhalers may be prescribed. Oral corticosteroids may be used short-term for severe episodes. 5. What’s the correct way to use these medications? Inhalers: Shake well before use, exhale fully, place the mouthpiece in your mouth, inhale deeply while pressing the inhaler, then hold your breath for 10 seconds before exhaling. Use a spacer if recommended. Rinse your mouth after corticosteroid inhalers to prevent irritation. Follow dosage instructions carefully and do not overuse quick-relief inhalers. Take long-term control medications daily, even when you feel well, to prevent symptoms. 6. Should I see a pulmonologist? If your symptoms are severe, persistent, or difficult to control, or if your primary care provider cannot confirm a diagnosis, seeing a pulmonologist (lung specialist) is recommended. A specialist can perform detailed lung function tests and tailor treatment to your needs GENOMIC DATA FOR Reactive Airway Disease Asthma-related genetic loci: Many genes identified in asthma research are relevant to RAD because of overlapping airway hyperreactivity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have pinpointed several key genes linked to airway disease susceptibility, including: ORMDL3 and GSDMB on chromosome 17q21, strongly associated with childhood-onset asthma and airway hyperreactivity. IL1RL1/IL18R1, IL33, HLA-DQ, SMAD3, IL2RB and others, which regulate immune responses and airway inflammation. Genetic variants in CFTR, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and MBL genes: Studies have explored these genes for their roles in obstructive lung diseases. For example, the F508del mutation in CFTR is marginally associated with increased asthma risk but is not a major marker for COPD or RAD. Gene-environment interactions: Genetic predisposition combined with environmental triggers (viruses, allergens, pollutants) influences RAD development and severity. For instance, defects in barrier proteins (e.g., FLG, SPINK5) can predispose to airway sensitivity and atopic conditions. Mouse model studies: Research using mouse models has identified genes like mClca3 and mClca5 that regulate mucous cell metaplasia and airway hyperreactivity, illustrating genetic segregation of airway disease traits and pointing to potential therapeutic targets DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Reactive Airway Disease Doctor: Hello, I understand you or your child have been experiencing breathing difficulties. Can you tell me more about the symptoms? Patient: Yes, there’s been a lot of coughing and wheezing, especially at night, and sometimes after playing or running around. Doctor: That sounds like reactive airway disease, or RAD, which is a term we use when someone has asthma-like symptoms but we haven’t confirmed asthma with lung tests yet. It’s common in young children who can’t do lung function tests. Patient: What causes this? Is it serious? Doctor: RAD is usually caused by your airways reacting strongly to triggers like viral infections, allergens, cold air, or smoke. It can make your chest feel tight and breathing difficult. The good news is that with proper treatment and avoiding triggers, most people improve. Patient: How do you diagnose it? Doctor: I’ll listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and ask about your symptoms and history. Sometimes we do lung function tests if possible. For young children, diagnosis is mostly clinical. We may also check for allergies or infections. Patient: What treatment do you recommend? Doctor: We usually start with inhalers that help open your airways quickly when you have symptoms, like albuterol. If symptoms happen often, we add inhaled corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. I’ll also advise you on avoiding triggers and what to do if symptoms worsen. Patient: How long will it take to get better? Doctor: It depends on the cause and how well you avoid triggers and use medications. Many children outgrow RAD, but some may develop asthma later. We’ll monitor your progress and adjust treatment as needed. Patient: Should I see a specialist? Doctor: If symptoms are severe, frequent, or not improving with treatment, I may refer you to a pulmonologist or allergist for further evaluation. Patient: Thank you. Is there anything else I should know? Doctor: Yes, it’s important to follow your asthma action plan, use medications correctly, and come back for follow-ups. I’ll give you some brochures and reliable websites for more information. REFERENCES Reactive Airway Disease: Causes, Symptoms & Treatment https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/800119-guidelines BRONCHITIS Alternative Names for Bronchitis Acute Bronchitis Refers to short-term inflammation of the bronchial tubes, usually caused by infections. Chronic Bronchitis A long-term condition characterized by persistent cough and mucus production, often part of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Tracheobronchitis Inflammation involving both the trachea (windpipe) and bronchi. Bronchial Inflammation A descriptive term emphasizing the inflamed state of the airways. Smoker’s Cough Informal term often used to describe chronic bronchitis symptoms in smokers. Bronchopneumonia Sometimes used when bronchitis is accompanied by pneumonia, indicating infection of both bronchi and lung tissue. Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI) A broader term that includes bronchitis along with other infections like pneumonia. DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF BRONCHITIS Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes. These tubes carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may start suddenly and be short term (acute) or start gradually and become long term (chronic). Acute bronchitis, which often develops from a cold or other respiratory infection, is very common. Also called a chest cold, acute bronchitis usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks. Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. If you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Causes of BRONCHITIS Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, typically the same viruses that cause colds and flu (influenza). Many different viruses — all of which are very contagious — can cause acute bronchitis. Antibiotics don\\'t kill viruses, so this type of medication isn\\'t useful in most cases of bronchitis. Viruses spread mainly from person to person by droplets produced when an ill person coughs, sneezes or talks and you inhale the droplets. Viruses may also spread through contact with an infected object. This happens when you touch something with the virus on it and then touch your mouth, eyes or nose. The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is cigarette smoking. Air pollution and dust or toxic gases in the environment or workplace also can contribute to the condition. Risk factors of BRONCHITIS Factors that increase your risk of bronchitis include: Cigarette smoke. People who smoke or who live with a smoker are at higher risk of both acute bronchitis and chronic bronchitis. Low resistance. This may result from another acute illness, such as a cold, or from a chronic condition that compromises your immune system. Older adults, infants and young children have greater vulnerability to infection. Exposure to irritants on the job. Your risk of developing bronchitis is greater if you work around certain lung irritants, such as grains or textiles, or are exposed to chemical fumes. Gastric reflux. Repeated bouts of severe heartburn can irritate your throat and make you more prone to developing bronchitis. Symptoms of BRONCHITIS If you have acute bronchitis, you may have cold symptoms, such as: Cough Production of mucus (sputum), which can be clear, white, yellowish-gray or green in color — rarely, it may be streaked with blood Sore throat Mild headache and body aches Slight fever and chills Fatigue Chest discomfort Shortness of breath and wheezing While these symptoms usually improve in about a week, you may have a nagging cough that lingers for several weeks. For chronic bronchitis, signs and symptoms may include: Cough Production of mucus Fatigue Chest discomfort Shortness of breath Chronic bronchitis is typically defined as a productive cough that lasts at least three months, with bouts that recur for at least two consecutive years. If you have chronic bronchitis, you\\'re likely to have periods when your cough or other symptoms worsen. It\\'s also possible to have an acute infection on top of chronic bronchitis. When to see a doctor for BRONCHITIS Contact your doctor or clinic for advice if your cough: Is accompanied by a fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C). Produces blood. Is associated with serious or worsening shortness of breath or wheezing. Includes other serious signs and symptoms, for example, you appear pale and lethargic, have a bluish tinge to your lips and nail beds, or have trouble thinking clearly or concentrating. Lasts more than three weeks. Before you go in, your doctor or clinic can give you guidance on how to prepare for your appointment. DIAGNOSIS of BRONCHITIS During the first few days of illness, it can be difficult to distinguish the signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis from those of a common cold. During the physical exam, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen closely to your lungs as you breathe. In some cases, your doctor may suggest the following tests: Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can help determine if you have pneumonia or another condition that may explain your cough. This is especially important if you smoke or have ever smoked. Sputum tests. Sputum is the mucus that you cough up from your lungs. It can be tested to see if you have illnesses that could be helped by antibiotics. Sputum can also be tested for signs of allergies. Pulmonary function test. During a pulmonary function test, you blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can get air out of your lungs. This test checks for signs of asthma, chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Treatment of BRONCHITIS Most cases of acute bronchitis get better without treatment, usually within a couple of weeks. Medications for BRONCHITIS In some circumstances, your doctor may recommend other medications, including: Cough medicine. If your cough keeps you from sleeping, you might try cough suppressants at bedtime. Other medications. If you have allergies, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), your doctor may recommend an inhaler and other medications to reduce inflammation and open narrowed passages in your lungs. Antibiotics. Because most cases of acute bronchitis are caused by viral infections, antibiotics aren\\'t effective. However, if your doctor suspects that you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe an antibiotic. Therapies If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from: Pulmonary rehabilitation. This is a breathing exercise program in which a respiratory therapist teaches you how to breathe more easily and increase your ability to be physically active. Oxygen therapy. This delivers extra oxygen to help you breathe. Common Medications Used to Treat Bronchitis Acute bronchitis is mostly viral, so antibiotics are generally not recommended unless a bacterial infection is confirmed or strongly suspected. Symptomatic treatment with rest, fluids, and OTC medications is often sufficient. Bronchodilators may be prescribed if wheezing or airway obstruction occurs. Corticosteroids are usually reserved for chronic bronchitis or severe cases. Side Effects Pain relievers: Can cause stomach upset or liver/kidney issues if overused. Cough suppressants: May cause drowsiness or dizziness. Expectorants: Generally well-tolerated but may cause mild nausea. Bronchodilators: Can cause tremors, increased heart rate, or nervousness. Inhaled corticosteroids: Risk of oral thrush; rinsing mouth after use reduces this. Antibiotics: Risk of diarrhea, allergic reactions, and antibiotic resistance if overused. Antivirals: Possible nausea and headache. Lifestyle and home remedies of BRONCHITIS If you have bronchitis, to help you feel better, you may want to try the following self-care measures: Get enough rest. Rest and sleep help your body heal. Drink plenty of fluids. Staying hydrated can help to thin mucus. Avoid lung irritants. Don\\'t smoke. Wear a mask when the air is polluted or if you\\'re exposed to irritants, such as paint or household cleaners with strong fumes. Use a humidifier. Warm, moist air helps relieve coughs and loosens mucus in your airways. Be sure to clean the humidifier according to the manufacturer\\'s recommendations to avoid the growth of bacteria and fungi in the water container. Consider a face covering in cold air. If cold air makes your cough worse and causes shortness of breath, put on a face mask or cover your mouth and nose with a scarf before you go outside. Complications of BRONCHITIS Although a single episode of bronchitis usually isn\\'t cause for concern, it can lead to pneumonia in some people. Repeated bouts of bronchitis, however, may mean that you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Prevention of BRONCHITIS To reduce your risk of bronchitis, follow these tips: Get an annual flu shot. Many cases of acute bronchitis result from influenza, a virus. Getting a yearly flu vaccine can help protect you from getting the flu. Also ask your doctor or clinic if you need a vaccination that protects against certain types of pneumonia. Wash your hands. To reduce your risk of catching a viral infection, wash your hands frequently and get in the habit of using alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Also, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Avoid close contact with people who have a viral infection. Stay away from people who have the flu or another respiratory illness. Avoid cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke increases your risk of chronic bronchitis. Wear appropriate face covering. If you have COPD, consider wearing a face mask at work if you\\'re exposed to dust or fumes. Talk to your employer about the appropriate protection. Wearing a face mask when you\\'re going to be among crowds helps reduce exposure to infections. Outlook / Prognosis of BRONCHITIS Acute bronchitis usually isn’t serious. While frustrating, you have to wait out the symptoms for a few weeks. If you’re living with a heart condition or another breathing condition, like asthma, it could make your symptoms worse or last longer. Chronic bronchitis can be a serious condition and might mean you have lung damage. While the damage can’t be reversed, your provider can help you manage your symptoms and have fewer flare-ups. If you have an ongoing condition like asthma, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure, bronchitis might make it worse (exacerbation). Tell your healthcare provider if you have any ongoing conditions. Can bronchitis go away on its own? Yes, acute bronchitis usually goes away on its own. It’s almost always caused by a virus, and you can’t get rid of most viruses with medicine. You can treat the symptoms at home while you wait for the inflammation to go down. Bronchitis caused by something else may need treatment to help it go away. Chronic bronchitis usually doesn’t go away completely but can get better with treatment. Most people get over bronchitis in about two weeks, but it might take as long as three to six weeks. You can manage your symptoms at home with over-the-counter medicines while you get better. If you don’t feel better after three weeks, see your healthcare provider. Diagnostic Considerations of BRONCHITIS Streptococcal pharyngitis is most caused by group A streptococci (45%) and anaerobes (18%), which often occur as a co-infection. Much of the concern about diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis is related to the complications of infection, particularly acute rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis as a late complication. Therefore, maintaining a high level of suspicion for streptococci group A in the presence of pharyngitis is advisable. Other medical issues/problems to consider include the following: Exercise-induced asthma Bacterial tracheitis Cough Cystic fibrosis Influenza Hyperreactive airway disease Retained foreign body Tonsillitis Occupational exposures Differential Diagnoses of BRONCHITIS Acute Sinusitis Alpha1-Antitrypsin (AAT) Deficiency Asthma Bacterial Pharyngitis Bronchiectasis Bronchiolitis Bronchitis Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic Sinusitis Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Infections Influenza Viral Pharyngitis Epidemiology of BRONCHITIS According to estimates from national interviews taken by the National Center for Health Statistics in 2006, approximately 9.5 million people, or 4% of the population, were diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. These statistics may underestimate the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by as much as 50%, because many patients underreport their symptoms, and their conditions remain undiagnosed. An overdiagnosis of chronic bronchitis by patients and clinicians has also been suggested, however. The term bronchitis is often used as a common descriptor for a nonspecific and self-limited cough, thereby falsely increasing its incidence even though the patient does not meet the criteria for diagnosis. In one study, acute bronchitis affected 44 of 1000 adults annually, and 82% of episodes occurred in fall or winter. By way of comparison, 91 million cases of influenza, 66 million cases of the common cold, and 31 million cases of other acute upper respiratory tract infections occurred that year. Acute bronchitis is common throughout the world and is one of the top 5 reasons for seeking medical care in countries that collect such data. No difference in racial distribution is reported, though bronchitis occurs more frequently in populations with a low socioeconomic status and in people who live in urban and highly industrialized areas. In terms of gender-specific incidence, bronchitis affects males more than females. In the United States, up to two thirds of men and one fourth of women have emphysema at death. Although found in all age groups, acute bronchitis is most frequently diagnosed in children younger than 5 years, whereas chronic bronchitis is more prevalent in people older than 50 years. GENOMIC DATA OF BRONCHITIS Acute Viral Bronchiolitis: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis found significant associations with variants in the GSDMB and CDHR3 genes. These genes modulate susceptibility to bronchiolitis, especially when caused by viruses other than respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Increased expression of GSDMB and ORMDL3 in immune cells correlates with higher bronchiolitis risk. Children with bronchiolitis in infancy linked to these genetic variants are more likely to develop asthma later in life, suggesting shared genetic pathways between bronchiolitis and asthma. Chronic Bronchitis and CFTR Mutations: Studies have shown that mutations in the CFTR gene (notably F508del, W1282X, N1303K) contribute to chronic bronchitis and bronchial asthma in children. These mutations affect ion transport and mucus clearance in the airways, increasing susceptibility to chronic respiratory conditions. A hereditary predisposition was found in about one-third of affected children’s parents, highlighting a genetic basis for chronic bronchitis. Other Genetic Markers: Research suggests associations between chronic bronchitis and certain blood group systems (MNS, Rhesus), and complement component alleles (e.g., absence of C3F allele linked to higher chronic bronchitis prevalence), indicating a multifactorial genetic influence PREDEFINED Questions and answer for BRONCHITIS 1. What’s the best way to treat my symptoms at home? Drink plenty of fluids (8-12 glasses a day) to thin mucus and make coughing easier. Get plenty of rest to help your body heal. Use a humidifier or inhale steam to loosen mucus and soothe airways. Gargle saltwater several times a day to relieve throat irritation. Avoid lung irritants like smoke, strong fumes, and cold air (wear a scarf or mask if needed). Use over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for fever and aches. Try honey (for adults and children over 1 year) to soothe cough. Avoid cough suppressants unless the cough is dry and disturbing sleep; productive coughs help clear mucus. Keep your environment clean and dust-free. 2. How long should I expect bronchitis to last? Acute bronchitis typically lasts about 7 to 10 days, but the cough can persist for up to 3 to 4 weeks or longer. Most people recover fully within 2 to 3 weeks, but some symptoms, especially cough, may linger. Chronic bronchitis lasts at least 3 months and requires medical management. 3. What new or worsening symptoms should I look out for? High or persistent fever (above 101.3°F or 38.5°C) Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing that worsens Chest pain or tightness Cough producing green, yellow, or bloody mucus Symptoms lasting longer than 3 weeks without improvement Signs of pneumonia such as chills, rapid breathing, or fatigue 4. When should I see you again if symptoms haven’t improved? If symptoms do not improve within 2 to 3 weeks or worsen at any time If you develop any of the worsening symptoms listed above If you have underlying lung diseases (e.g., asthma, COPD) and symptoms worsen If you experience difficulty breathing or chest pain Bronchitis vs. Pneumonia: How are they Different? What’s the difference between bronchitis and pneumonia? Bronchitis is an inflammation of the airways leading to the lungs. Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs themselves. Bronchitis causes inflammation and mucus in your trachea and bronchi that make you cough a lot. Pneumonia causes inflammation and fluid in the small sacs in your lungs (alveoli) that makes it hard to breathe. You also usually have a cough and a fever. Pneumonia is more serious than bronchitis. While you could have an infection that causes both, bronchitis doesn’t usually turn into pneumonia. What’s the difference between bronchitis and bronchiolitis? Bronchitis is inflammation in the larger airways (trachea and bronchi) coming into the lungs. Bronchiolitis is an inflammation of the next smaller airways (bronchioles) that come off of the bronchi. Children usually get bronchiolitis while adults get bronchitis. Is menthol vapor rub good for bronchitis? You might use vapor rubs, like Vicks VapoRub® or Mentholatum® ointment, for anything that ails you and wonder if they work for bronchitis. Vapor rubs have ingredients in them intended to calm down coughs, so they may help your bronchitis symptoms. Don’t use vapor rubs on children under two without asking your pediatrician first. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION FOR BRONCHITIS Doctor: Can you tell me what’s bothering you today? Patient: I’ve had a cough for the past few days. It started after I had a cold. Doctor: How long has the cough lasted, and is it dry or productive? Patient: It’s been about a week now, and I’m coughing up some mucus. Doctor: Do you have any other symptoms like fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath? Patient: I had a mild fever a few days ago, and sometimes my chest feels tight, especially when I cough a lot. Doctor: Based on your symptoms, it sounds like acute bronchitis, which is inflammation of the airways usually caused by a viral infection. It’s common after a cold or flu. Patient: Is it serious? How long will it last? Doctor: Most people recover in 2 to 3 weeks, but the cough can linger a bit longer. It’s usually not serious in healthy adults. Patient: What can I do to feel better? Doctor: Rest, drink plenty of fluids, and use over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for fever and aches. Using a humidifier or inhaling steam can help loosen mucus. Avoid smoking and irritants. Patient: Do I need antibiotics? Doctor: Since bronchitis is usually viral, antibiotics aren’t needed unless there’s a bacterial infection. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a few weeks, let me know. Patient: When should I come back or see a specialist? Doctor: If you develop high fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain, or if your cough lasts more than 3 weeks, you should come back. If you have underlying lung conditions like asthma or COPD, or if symptoms worsen, a referral to a pulmonologist might be necessary. Patient: Thank you. Is there anything else I should watch for? Doctor: Yes, watch for worsening shortness of breath, coughing up blood, or severe fatigue. If any of these happen, seek medical attention promptly. REFERENCES Bronchitis: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis & Treatment Bronchitis - Diagnosis and treatment - Mayo Clinic https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/297108-workup#c8 BRONCHIOLITIS Alternative Names for Bronchiolitis Acute Bronchiolitis Refers to the sudden onset inflammation of the small airways (bronchioles), usually in infants and young children. Viral Bronchiolitis Emphasizes that the condition is typically caused by viral infections, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Infantile Bronchiolitis Highlights the age group most affected infants under 2 years old. Obstructive Bronchiolitis Describes the airway obstruction caused by inflammation and mucus. Bronchiolitis Obliterans (Constrictive Bronchiolitis) A rare, chronic form of bronchiolitis characterized by permanent scarring and narrowing of the bronchioles, often due to injury or infection. Small Airway Disease A broader term sometimes used to describe conditions affecting the bronchioles, including bronchiolitis. DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF BRONCHIOLITIS Bronchiolitis is a common lung infection in young children and infants. It causes swelling and irritation and a buildup of mucus in the small airways of the lung. These small airways are called bronchioles. Bronchiolitis is almost always caused by a virus. Bronchiolitis starts out with symptoms much like a common cold. But then it gets worse, causing coughing and a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing out called wheezing. Sometimes children have trouble breathing. Symptoms of bronchiolitis can last for 1 to 2 weeks but occasionally can last longer. Most children get better with care at home. A small number of children need a stay in the hospital. Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection among children younger than 2 years old. The viruses that cause bronchiolitis are contagious. These viruses spread through respiratory droplets (saliva or mucus) from someone’s mouth or nose. When someone sneezes or coughs, these droplets become airborne and spread from person to person or stick to frequently touched surfaces or objects. Bronchiolitis and bronchitis Bronchiolitis and bronchitis are two conditions that both sound similar and have similar symptoms. A virus causes both conditions, which target the airways in your lungs. Bronchitis affects the bronchi, or the larger airways. Bronchiolitis affects your smaller airways (bronchioles). Bronchitis usually affects older children and adults, while bronchiolitis is more common in younger children. Causes of BRONCHIOLITIS Bronchiolitis happens when a virus infects the bronchioles, which are the smallest airways in the lungs. The infection makes the bronchioles swollen and irritated. Mucus collects in these airways, which makes it difficult for air to flow freely in and out of the lungs. Bronchiolitis is usually caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is a common virus that infects just about every child by 2 years of age. Outbreaks of RSV infection often happen during the colder months of the year in some locations or the rainy season in others. A person can get it more than once. Bronchiolitis also can be caused by other viruses, including those that cause the flu or the common cold. The viruses that cause bronchiolitis are easily spread. You can get them through droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks. You also can get them by touching shared items — such as dishes, doorknobs, towels or toys — and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Risk factors of BRONCHIOLITIS Bronchiolitis usually affects children under the age of 2 years. Infants younger than 3 months have the highest risk of getting bronchiolitis because their lungs and their ability to fight infections aren\\'t yet fully developed. Rarely, adults can get bronchiolitis. Other factors that increase the risk of bronchiolitis in infants and young children include: Being born too early. Having a heart or lung condition. Having a weakened immune system. This makes it hard to fight infections. Being around tobacco smoke. Contact with lots of other children, such as in a childcare setting. Spending time in crowded places. Having siblings who go to school or get childcare services and bring home the infection. Signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis Early signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis resemble those of the common cold, including: A runny nose. A slight fever (under 101 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius). A cough. Fatigue. Fussiness or irritability (infants). A bronchiolitis infection targets your child’s airways and can cause the following symptoms that affect their breathing: Rapid or shallow breathing. Wheezing. Grunting noises when they breathe. Flaring of the nostrils. If your child has trouble breathing or you notice the following symptoms of severe bronchiolitis, call their healthcare provider or visit the emergency room immediately: Difficulty sucking and/or swallowing (unable to feed). Flaring (widening) nostrils when breathing. Chest retracts during breathing (their skin pulls down tightly against their rib cage and makes their chest look like it’s pulling inward). Blue, gray or pale skin tone on their lips, fingers or toes (cyanosis). Dry mouth, not urinating (peeing) or crying without producing tears (dehydration). When to see a doctor for BRONCHIOLITIS If symptoms become serious, call your child\\'s health care provider. This is especially important if your child is younger than 12 weeks old or has other risk factors for bronchiolitis — for example, being born too early, also called premature, or having a heart condition. Get medical attention right away if your child has any of these symptoms: Has blue or gray skin, lips and fingernails due to low oxygen levels. Struggles to breathe and can\\'t speak or cry. Refuses to drink enough or breathes too fast to eat or drink. Breathes very fast — in infants this can be more than 60 breaths a minute — with short, shallow breaths. Can\\'t breathe easily and the ribs seem to suck inward when breathing in. Makes wheezing sounds when breathing. Makes grunting noises with each breath. Appears slow moving, weak or very tired. Diagnosis of BRONCHIOLITIS Your child\\'s health care provider can usually diagnose bronchiolitis by the symptoms and listening to your child\\'s lungs with a stethoscope. Tests and X-rays are not usually needed to diagnose bronchiolitis. But your child\\'s provider may recommend tests if your child is at risk of severe bronchiolitis, if symptoms are getting worse or if the provider thinks there may be another problem. Tests may include: Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show if there are signs of pneumonia. Viral testing. A sample of mucus from your child\\'s nose can be used to test for the virus causing bronchiolitis. This is done using a swab that\\'s gently inserted into the nose. Blood tests. Occasionally, blood tests might be used to check your child\\'s white blood cell count. An increase in white blood cells is usually a sign that the body is fighting an infection. A blood test also can show if the level of oxygen in your child\\'s bloodstream is low. Your child\\'s provider may look for symptoms of dehydration, especially if your child has been refusing to drink or eat or has been vomiting. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth and skin, extreme tiredness, and making little or no urine. Treatment of BRONCHIOLITIS Bronchiolitis usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks but symptoms occasionally last longer. Most children with bronchiolitis can be cared for at home with comfort measures. It\\'s important to be alert for problems with breathing that are getting worse. For example, struggling for each breath, not being able to speak or cry because of struggling to breathe, or making grunting noises with each breath. Because viruses cause bronchiolitis, antibiotics — which are used to treat infections caused by bacteria — don\\'t work against viruses. Bacterial infections such as pneumonia or an ear infection can happen along with bronchiolitis. In this case, your child\\'s health care provider may give an antibiotic for the bacterial infection. Medicines called bronchodilators that open the airways don\\'t seem to help bronchiolitis, so they usually aren\\'t given. In severe cases, your child\\'s health care provider may try a nebulized albuterol treatment to see if it helps. During this treatment, a machine creates a fine mist of medicine that your child breathes into the lungs. Oral corticosteroid medicines and pounding on the chest to loosen mucus, a treatment called chest physiotherapy, have not been shown to be effective for bronchiolitis and are not recommended. Hospital care A small number of children may need a stay in the hospital. Your child may receive oxygen through a face mask to get enough oxygen into the blood. Your child also may get fluids through a vein to prevent dehydration. In severe cases, a tube may be guided into the windpipe to help breathing. Bronchiolitis treatment drugs and their side effects 1. Supportive Care (Mainstay of Treatment) Oxygen therapy: To maintain adequate oxygen saturation (above 92%). Hydration and nutrition support: Oral or intravenous fluids as needed. Nasal suctioning: To clear mucus and ease breathing. 2. Bronchodilators (e.g., Albuterol/Salbutamol) Sometimes used to relieve wheezing, but evidence of benefit is inconsistent. If used, treatment should continue only if objective improvement in breathing or oxygenation is observed. Side effects: Tremors, increased heart rate, nervousness. 3. Corticosteroids (Systemic or Inhaled) Corticosteroids like dexamethasone or prednisolone have been studied extensively. Routine use is not recommended as most studies show no significant benefit in acute bronchiolitis. May be considered in specific cases with a history of reactive airway disease or atopy. Side effects: Potential for immune suppression, increased risk of infections, mood changes, and in infants, unknown long-term effects on lung development. 4. Epinephrine (Nebulized) Some evidence supports use in infants aged 6 weeks to 12 months as cost-effective treatment combined with corticosteroids. Side effects: Increased heart rate, anxiety, tremors. 5. Antibiotics Not indicated unless there is confirmed bacterial infection. Side effects: Allergic reactions, antibiotic resistance, gastrointestinal upset. 6. Ribavirin Antiviral agent rarely used; reserved for immunocompromised patients. Side effects: Anemia, rash, fatigue. 7. Other Therapies Hypertonic saline nebulization (3% saline): May improve mucus clearance and symptoms in mild to moderate cases. Chest physiotherapy: Not recommended routinely as it has not shown benefit. Lifestyle and home remedies OF BRONCHIOLITIS Though it may not be possible to shorten the length of your child\\'s illness, you may be able to make your child more comfortable. Here are some tips: Humidify the air. If the air in your child\\'s room is dry, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer can moisten the air. This may help loosen mucus and lessen coughing. Be sure to keep the humidifier clean so that bacteria and molds don\\'t grow in the machine. Give your child liquids to stay hydrated. Infants should have formula or breast milk only. Your child\\'s health care provider may add oral rehydration therapy. Older kids can drink whatever they want, such as water, juice or milk, as long as they\\'re drinking. Your child may drink more slowly than usual because of swelling and mucus in the nose. Offer small amounts of liquid often. Try saline nose drops to ease stuffiness. You can buy these drops without a prescription. They are effective, safe and won\\'t irritate the nose, even for children. Put several drops into the opening on one side of the nose, called the nostril, then bulb suction that nostril right away. Be careful not to push the bulb too far into the nose. Repeat the same steps in the other nostril. Consider pain relievers that you can buy without a prescription. For treatment of fever or pain, ask your child\\'s health care provider about giving your child infants\\' or children\\'s over-the-counter fever and pain medicines such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others). Those are safer than aspirin. Aspirin is not recommended in children due to the risk of Reye\\'s syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. Children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin, as they have a higher risk of Reye\\'s syndrome. Avoid secondhand smoke. Smoke can worsen symptoms of respiratory infections. If a family member smokes, ask them to smoke outside of the house and outside of the car. Don\\'t use other over-the-counter medicines, except for fever reducers and pain relievers, to treat coughs and colds in children under 6 years old. Also, consider avoiding the use of these medicines for children younger than 12 years old. The risks to children outweigh the benefits. Complications OF BRONCHIOLITIS Complications of severe bronchiolitis may include: Low oxygen in the body. Pauses in breathing, which is most likely to happen in babies born too early and in babies under 2 months old. Not being able to drink enough liquids. This can cause dehydration, when too much body fluid is lost. Not being able to get the amount of oxygen needed. This is called respiratory failure. If any of these happen, your child may need to be in the hospital. Severe respiratory failure may require that a tube be guided into the windpipe. This helps your child breathe until the infection improves. Prevention OF BRONCHIOLITIS Because the viruses that cause bronchiolitis spread from person to person, one of the best ways to prevent infection is to wash your hands often. This is especially important before touching your baby when you have a cold, flu or other illness that can be spread. If you have any of these illnesses, wear a face mask. If your child has bronchiolitis, keep your child at home until the illness is past to avoid spreading it to others. To help prevent infection: Limit contact with people who have a fever or cold. If your child is a newborn, especially a premature newborn, avoid being around people with colds. This is especially important in the first two months of life. Clean and disinfect surfaces. Clean and disinfect surfaces and items that people often touch, such as toys and doorknobs. This is especially important if a family member is sick. Wash hands often. Frequently wash your own hands and those of your child. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Keep an alcohol-based hand sanitizer handy to use when you\\'re away from home. Make sure it contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover coughs and sneezes. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue. Throw away the tissue. Then wash your hands. If soap and water aren\\'t available, use a hand sanitizer. If you don\\'t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands. Use your own drinking glass. Don\\'t share glasses with others, especially if someone in your family is ill. Breastfeed, when possible. Respiratory infections are less common in breastfed babies. Immunizations and medicines In the U.S., respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children who are less than a year old. Two options for immunization can help prevent young infants from getting severe RSV. Both are recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and others. You and your healthcare professional should discuss which option is best to protect your child: Antibody product called nirsevimab (Beyfortus). This antibody product is a single dose shot given in the month before or during RSV season. It\\'s for newborn babies and those younger than 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season. In the U.S., the RSV season typically is November through March, but it varies in Florida, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam and other U.S. Pacific Island territories. Nirsevimab also should be given to children 8 months through 19 months old who are at higher risk of severe RSV disease through their second RSV season. Higher risk conditions include: Children with active chronic lung disease from being born too soon (prematurely). Children with a severely weakened immune system. Children with severe cystic fibrosis. American Indian or Alaska Native children. In rare situations, when nirsevimab is not available or a child is not eligible for it, another antibody product called palivizumab may be given. But palivizumab requires monthly shots given during the RSV season, while nirsevimab is only one shot. Palivizumab is not recommended for healthy children or adults. Vaccine for pregnant people. The FDA approved an RSV vaccine called Abrysvo for pregnant people to prevent RSV in infants from birth through 6 months of age. A single dose shot of Abrysvo can be given sometime from 32 weeks through 36 weeks of pregnancy during September through January in the U.S. Abrysvo is not recommended for infants or children. Other viruses can cause bronchiolitis too. These include COVID-19 and influenza or flu. Getting seasonal COVID-19 and flu shots every year is recommended for everyone older than 6 months. Outlook / Prognosis OF BRONCHIOLITIS Your child may have symptoms for up to a week if they have bronchiolitis. During their illness, they may have trouble eating full meals or lose their appetite. To help your child eat when they don’t want to, try feeding them multiple small meals throughout the day instead of larger meals less often. It’s important to keep your child hydrated since they’re at a high risk of dehydration during their illness. To alleviate your child’s symptoms, talk to their healthcare provider to see what’s safe for your child to take, like over the counter (OTC) medications to reduce a fever. Don’t give your child aspirin, as it can lead to Reye’s syndrome. If your child has symptoms that don’t improve after one week or get worse, contact their healthcare provider. If your child has trouble breathing, contact emergency services or visit the emergency room immediately. Some children develop asthma as they grow if they had bronchiolitis when they were infants. While less common, some children may develop pneumonia after bronchiolitis. Can you have bronchiolitis more than once? Yes. Since there are many viruses that can cause bronchiolitis, your child can develop the infection more than once. Diagnostic Considerations OF BRONCHIOLITIS Bronchiolitis and asthma have similar symptoms and signs, and some concern exists that patients with asthma could be misdiagnosed with bronchiolitis. The pathology of bronchiolitis involves edema of the airway wall rather than bronchoconstriction (as in asthma). In addition to the conditions listed in the differential diagnosis, other problems to be considered include the following: Branchial cleft cyst Bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP) Bronchomalacia Cardiac disease Congenital heart disease Congenital lobar emphysema Congenital structural airway anomaly Constrictive bronchiolitis Gastroesophageal reflux Tracheal ring Vascular ring Differential Diagnoses OF BRONCHIOLITIS Altitude-Related Disorders Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Aspiration Syndromes Asthma Bacterial Pneumonia Chlamydial Pneumonias Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Croup Cystic Fibrosis Heart Failure Mycoplasmal Pneumonia Pediatric Apnea Pediatric Foreign Body Ingestion Pediatric Pneumonia Pediatric Sepsis Pertussis Pneumothorax Imaging Viral Pneumonia Epidemiology OF BRONCHIOLITIS United States statistics Respiratory infection is observed in 25% of children younger than 12 months and 13% of children aged 1-2 years. Of these 25%, one half have wheezing-associated respiratory disease. RSV can be cultured from one third of these outpatients and from 80% of hospitalized children younger than 6 months of age. Nearly 100% of children experience an RSV infection within 2 RSV seasons, and 1% are hospitalized. Among healthy full-term infants, 80% of hospitalizations due to bronchiolitis occur in the first year, and 50% of hospitalizations occur in children aged 1-3 months. Fewer than 5% of hospitalizations occur in the first 30 days of life, presumably because of transplacental transfer of maternal antibody. Descriptive analysis of the US National Hospital Discharge Survey data from 1980 through 1996 showed that admissions associated with bronchiolitis totaled 1.65 million. In a retrospective analysis of data from the same source for 1997-2006, RSV-coded hospitalizations accounted for 24% of an estimated 5.5 million lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years of age. Between 2-3% of all children younger than 12 months of age are hospitalized with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, which accounts for between 57,000 and 172,000 hospitalizations annually. The cost of hospitalization for bronchiolitis in children younger than 2 years is estimated to be more than $1.7 billion in 2009. While bronchiolitis remains a cause of significant mortality among children in the developing world, fewer than 100 annual deaths in the United States among young children are attributable to RSV infection. In most regions of the United States, the highest RSV activity usually occurs in winter with peaks from October to February and a relative subsidence only from March to July. An exception is the subtropical regions of the southeastern United States (eg, Florida) where RSV is endemic throughout the year. Secondary RSV infections occur in 46% of family members, 98% of other children attending a childcare center, 42% of hospital staff, and 45% of previously uninfected hospitalized infants. Infection is spread through self-inoculation of nasopharyngeal or ocular mucous membranes after direct contact with respiratory fomites and contaminated environmental surfaces. RSV can survive for several hours on hands and surfaces; therefore, handwashing and using disposable gloves and gowns may reduce nosocomial spread. International statistics Bronchiolitis is a significant cause of respiratory disease worldwide. According to the World Health Organization bulletin, an estimated 150 million new cases occur annually; 11-20 million (7-13%) of these cases are severe enough to require hospital admission. Worldwide, 95% of all cases occur in developing countries. The frequency of bronchiolitis in developed countries appears to be similar to that in the United States. Epidemiologic data for underdeveloped countries are incomplete. Epidemiologic data from underdeveloped countries show that RSV is a predominant viral cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections and accounts for about 65% of hospitalizations attributed to viruses. Despite incomplete data about RSV-associated mortality from developing countries, in 2005, RSV alone was estimated to cause 66,000 to 199,000 deaths among children younger than 5 years of age. Morbidity and mortality is higher in less-developed countries likely because of poor nutrition and lack of resources for supportive medical care. In the northern hemisphere, RSV epidemics generally occur annually in winter and late spring, whereas parainfluenza outbreaks usually occur in the fall. Conversely, in the southern hemisphere, wintertime epidemics occur from May to September. Descriptive epidemiologic data from a population-based cohort (Georgia Air Basin, Canada) reported by Koehoorn et al indicated that from 1999 through 2002, bronchiolitis was associated with 12,474 inpatient and outpatient physician contacts during the first year of life. This equates to 134.2 cases per 1000 person-years. In total, 1588 bronchiolitis cases resulted in hospitalization (17.1 cases per 1000 person-years). Age-related demographics Although infection with the agents that cause bronchiolitis may occur at any age, the clinical entity of bronchiolitis includes only infants and young children. About 75% of cases of bronchiolitis occur in children younger than 1 year and 95% in children younger than 2 years. Incidence peaks in those aged 2-8 months. Age is a significant factor in the severity of infection: The younger the patient is, the more severe the infection tends to be, as measured by the lowest oxygen saturation. Infants younger than 6 months are most severely affected, owing to their smaller, more easily obstructed airways and their decreased ability to clear secretions. Intrauterine cigarette-smoke exposure may impair in utero airway development or alter the elastic properties of the lung tissue. Exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke (e.g., by a parent or family member) in the postnatal period compounds the severity of RSV bronchiolitis in infants. Although RSV bronchiolitis is clearly a significant disease of the young child, immunity has been shown to wane over time; susceptible adults may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and act as carriers. With the increasing use of treatment modalities that compromise cellular immunity, RSV infection may be life-threatening to older children and adults undergoing organ and bone marrow transplantation, as well as to the elderly. Sex-related demographics Severe bronchiolitis occurs more frequently in males than in females; a pattern like other respiratory viral infections. The exact reason for this difference is unknown. Death is 1.5 times more likely in males. Race-related demographics Race and low socioeconomic status may adversely affect outcome in patients with acute bronchiolitis. Multiple population-based reports sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate no disparity in the rates of hospitalization for RSV infection between black and white children. A study by La Via et al demonstrated that although more minority children than white children were hospitalized with RSV infection, nothing indicated that the infections in minority children were more or less severe than those in white children. Lower socioeconomic status may increase the likelihood of hospitalization. Hospitalization rates are higher in Native American, Alaskan, and Hispanic populations, but it is not clear if this is due to more severe infection or to a lower threshold for admission. Guidelines OF BRONCHIOLITIS AAP guidelines for pediatric bronchiolitis The American Academy of Pediatrics released updated guidelines on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of bronchiolitis in children aged 1 to 23 months. The guidelines emphasize the use of supportive care, including hydration and oxygen. Other recommendations include the following: As multiple viruses may cause bronchiolitis, testing for specific viruses is not necessary. Routine radiographic or laboratory studies are also not necessary. Diagnosis and assessment of bronchiolitis severity should be based on patient history and physical examination. There is no need for a trial dose of a bronchodilator. Otherwise, healthy infants with gestational age of 29 weeks or more should not receive palivizumab to prevent respiratory syncytial virus infections. Infants under one year of age with hemodynamically significant heart disease or chronic lung disease of prematurity should be treated with palivizumab, up to a maximum of 5 monthly doses, during the respiratory syncytial virus season. Risk factors for severe disease include age less than 12 weeks, prematurity, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and immunodeficiency. Epinephrine and chest physiotherapy should not be administered to infants and children with bronchiolitis GENOMIC DATA OF BRONCHIOLITIS TLR4 Gene Variants: Mutations in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene, specifically the Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms, are strongly associated with increased severity of RSV bronchiolitis in infants under 12 months. These variants impair TLR4 receptor function on bronchial epithelial cells, leading to reduced immune signaling and a blunted response to RSV infection, which increases the risk of severe disease requiring hospitalization. DNAH9 Gene Mutations: Variants in the DNAH9 gene have been linked to post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO), a chronic obstructive lung disease following severe bronchiolitis. Whole exome sequencing in pediatric patients identified multiple DNAH9 mutations associated with airway obstruction after infections such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and adenovirus. ABCA3 and Surfactant Protein Mutations: Mutations in surfactant-related genes like ABCA3 may contribute to the pathogenesis of PIBO by affecting lung surfactant function and airway repair mechanisms. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) Polymorphisms: Certain IL-8 gene polymorphisms have been studied in infants with bronchiolitis, suggesting a role in modulating inflammatory responses during infection. RSV Viral Genetic Variations: Studies of the RSV virus itself shows multiple mutations, especially in the fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins, which may affect viral infectivity and immune evasion, potentially impacting disease severity and vaccine development PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR BRONCHIOLITIS 1. Should I give my child medication? If so, for how long and at what times of the day? Most bronchiolitis cases are managed with supportive care rather than medications. Routine use of bronchodilators (like albuterol) or corticosteroids is not recommended as they have not shown consistent benefit. In some cases, a single trial of a bronchodilator may be considered if there is a family history of asthma or atopy, but treatment should be stopped if no improvement is seen. Antibiotics are only needed if there is a confirmed bacterial infection. Always follow your doctor’s specific instructions if medications are prescribed. 2. When will my child start to feel better? Symptoms usually improve within 7 to 10 days, but the cough and mild breathing difficulties can last for 2 to 3 weeks. Most infants recover fully without complications. 3. Will I need to bring my child back for a follow-up visit? Follow-up is recommended if symptoms worsen or do not improve within 2 to 3 weeks. Also bring your child back if you notice increased difficulty breathing, poor feeding, dehydration, or persistent high fever. Some children with risk factors or severe illness may require hospital observation. 4. Should I keep my child home from school or daycare? Yes, keep your child home while they have symptoms, especially if they have a cough, runny nose, or fever, to prevent spreading the infection. Your child can return once they are fever-free and feeling better, but consult your healthcare provider for specific advice. 5. Which over-the-counter pain relievers do you recommend? Use acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen to reduce fever and relieve discomfort. Avoid aspirin in children due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome. Follow dosing instructions carefully based on your child’s age and weight. 6. Which symptoms should I look out for? Seek medical attention if your child develops: Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing Persistent high fever (above 38.5°C or 101.3°F) Poor feeding or signs of dehydration (few wet diapers, dry mouth) Bluish color around lips or face Severe lethargy or unresponsiveness Wheezing or chest retractions (pulling in of skin between ribs or neck) Admission Criteria A decision must be made as to whether the patient should be treated in an inpatient or an outpatient setting. For hospitalized patients, the length of stay averages 2-3 days, with a readmission rate of 1-4%. Considerations for hospital admission may include the following: Persistent resting oxygen saturation below 90% in room air Markedly elevated respiratory rate (>70-80 breaths/min) Dyspnea, intercostal retractions and cyanosis (indicating respiratory distress) Chronic lung disease, especially if the patient is already receiving supplemental oxygen Congenital heart disease, especially if hemodynamically significant (associated with cyanosis or pulmonary hypertension) Prematurity Age younger than 3 months, when severe disease is most common Inability to maintain oral hydration in patients younger than 6 months and difficulty feeding as a consequence of respiratory distress Parent unable to care for child at home A decision must also be made regarding admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Criteria for ICU admission vary greatly. In general, ICU admission is uncommon for previously healthy infants who present with bronchiolitis. Severely ill children should be admitted to an adequately equipped intensive care unit (ICU). If this requires transfer to another hospital, transport personnel and vehicles specifically intended for pediatric transport are desirable. Patients with the following conditions should be evaluated for ICU admission: Worsening hypoxemia or hypercapnia Worsening respiratory distress Persistent oxygen desaturation and/or severe cyanosis in spite of adequate oxygen delivery Apnea Acidosis Extrapulmonary symptoms Worsening mental status Unclear etiology of symptoms DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON BRONCHIOLITIS Doctor: Hello, I see your child has been coughing and having some breathing difficulties. Can you tell me more about the symptoms? Parent: Yes, my baby has had a runny nose and cough for a few days, and now they seem to be breathing faster and wheezing a bit. Doctor: That sounds like bronchiolitis, which is a common viral infection in young children that causes inflammation in the small airways. It usually gets better on its own with supportive care. Parent: Is this serious? What can I do to help my child? Doctor: Most cases are mild and can be managed at home. The best treatment is supportive care: keeping your child well hydrated, using saline nose drops and gentle suctioning to clear nasal mucus, and making sure they get plenty of rest. If your child has trouble breathing or low oxygen levels, they may need hospital care. Parent: Should my child be given any medications? Doctor: Routine use of bronchodilators like albuterol or steroids is not recommended because studies show they don’t help most children with bronchiolitis. Antibiotics are only needed if there’s a bacterial infection, which is uncommon. You can give acetaminophen or ibuprofen if your child has a fever or seems uncomfortable. Parent: How long will it take for my child to get better? Doctor: Symptoms usually peak around 3 to 5 days and improve over 1 to 2 weeks. The cough may linger for a few more weeks. Parent: When should I bring my child back or seek emergency care? Doctor: If your child has difficulty breathing, is feeding poorly, has persistent high fever, becomes very lethargic, or if you notice blue lips or face, you should seek medical attention immediately. Also, if symptoms don’t improve after 2 to 3 weeks, a follow-up visit is advisable. Parent: Should my child stay home from daycare? Doctor: Yes, it’s best to keep your child home while they have symptoms to prevent spreading the infection to others. Doctor: I’ll give you some written information about bronchiolitis and what signs to watch for. If you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to contact us.

DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Pneumonia Pneumonia is an infection in your lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. Pneumonia causes your lung tissue to swell (inflammation) and can cause fluid or pus in your lungs. Bacterial pneumonia is usually more severe than viral pneumonia, which often resolves on its own. Pneumonia can affect one or both lungs. Pneumonia in both of your lungs is called bilateral or double pneumonia. Viral and bacterial pneumonia While all pneumonia is inflammation caused by an infection in your lungs, you may have different symptoms depending on whether the root cause is a virus, bacteria or fungi. Bacterial pneumonia tends to be more common and more severe than viral pneumonia. It’s more likely to require a hospital stay. Providers treat bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics. Viral pneumonia causes flu-like symptoms and is more likely to resolve on its own. You usually don’t need specific treatment for viral pneumonia. Types of pneumonia We categorize pneumonia by which pathogen (virus, bacteria or fungi) caused it and how you got it — community-acquired, hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) When you get pneumonia outside of a healthcare facility, it’s called community-acquired pneumonia. Causes include: Bacteria: Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, also called pneumococcal disease, is the most common cause of CAP. Pneumococcal disease can also cause ear infections, sinus infections and meningitis. Mycoplasma pneumoniae bacteria causes atypical pneumonia, which usually has milder symptoms. Other bacteria that cause CAP include Haemophilus influenza, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella (Legionnaires’ disease). Viruses: Viruses that cause the common cold, the flu (influenza), COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can sometimes lead to pneumonia. Fungi (molds): Fungi, like Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis jirovecii and Coccidioides, are uncommon causes of pneumonia. People with compromised immune systems are most at risk of getting pneumonia from a fungus. Protozoa: Rarely, protozoa like Toxoplasma cause pneumonia. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) You can get hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) while in a hospital or healthcare facility for another illness or procedure. HAP is usually more serious than community-acquired pneumonia because it’s often caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This means HAP can make you sicker and be harder to treat. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) You can get HCAP while in a long-term care facility (such as a nursing home) or outpatient, extended-stay clinics. Like hospital-acquired pneumonia, it’s usually caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) If you need to be on a respirator or breathing machine to help you breathe in the hospital (usually in the ICU), you’re at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The same types of bacteria as community-acquired pneumonia, as well as the drug-resistant kinds that cause hospital-acquired pneumonia, cause VAP. Aspiration pneumonia Aspiration is when solid food, liquids, spit or vomit go down your trachea (windpipe) and into your lungs. If you can’t cough these up, your lungs can get infected. Learn common symptoms of pneumonia and when you should seek medical attention. Pneumonia versus the common cold or the flu It can be difficult to tell the difference between the symptoms of a cold, the flu and pneumonia, and only a healthcare provider can diagnose you. As pneumonia can be life-threatening, it’s important to seek medical attention for serious symptoms that could be signs of pneumonia, such as: Congestion or chest pain. Difficulty breathing. A fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.88 degrees Celsius) or higher. Coughing up yellow, green or bloody mucus or spit. Who is most at risk of getting pneumonia? You’re at an increased risk of pneumonia if you: Are over the age of 65 and or under the age of 2. Are living with a lung or heart condition. Examples include cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis or sarcoidosis. Are living with a neurological condition that makes swallowing difficult. Conditions like dementia, Parkinson’s disease and stroke increase your risk of aspiration pneumonia. Are in the hospital or at a long-term care facility. Smoke. Are pregnant. Have a weakened immune system. You might have a weakened immune system if you’re on chemotherapy, are an organ transplant recipient, are living with HIV/AIDS or are taking medications that suppress your immune system. Anyone can get pneumonia. It’s a common illness, with millions of people diagnosed each year in the United States. About 55,000 people die each year of pneumonia in the U.S. It’s the most common cause of death in developing countries. Causes OF Pneumonia Pneumonia can develop when your immune system attacks an infection in the small sacs of your lung (alveoli). This causes your lungs to swell and leak fluids. Many bacteria, viruses and fungi can cause the infections that lead to pneumonia. Bacteria are the most common cause in adults and viruses are the most common cause in school-aged children. Common illnesses that can lead to pneumonia include: Common cold (rhinovirus). COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2). The flu (influenza virus). Human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV). Legionnaires’ disease. Mycoplasma pneumonia bacteria. Pneumococcal disease. Pneumocystis pneumonia. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Is pneumonia contagious? Pneumonia itself isn’t contagious, but the bacteria and viruses that cause it are. For instance, the flu is contagious and can lead to pneumonia, but most people who get the flu won’t get pneumonia. The bacteria that most commonly causes pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumoniae, can be spread from person to person by touching infected surfaces or through coughing and sneezing. Pneumonia caused by fungi isn’t contagious. Fungal infections aren’t spread from person to person like viruses and bacteria. signs and symptoms of pneumonia Symptoms of pneumonia depend on the cause. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Babies, young children and older adults may have different symptoms. Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia can develop gradually or suddenly. Symptoms include: High fever (up to 105 F or 40.55 C). Cough with yellow, green or bloody mucus. Tiredness (fatigue). Rapid breathing. Shortness of breath. Rapid heart rate. Sweating or chills. Chest pain and/or abdominal pain, especially with coughing or deep breathing. Loss of appetite. Bluish skin, lips or nails (cyanosis). Confusion or altered mental state. Symptoms of viral pneumonia Symptoms of viral pneumonia usually develop over several days. You might have symptoms similar to bacterial pneumonia, or you might additionally have: Dry cough. Headache. Muscle pain. Extreme tiredness or weakness. Symptoms of pneumonia in young children Babies and newborns may not show any symptoms of pneumonia, or their symptoms may be different from adults, including: Fever, chills, general discomfort, sweating/flushed skin. Cough. Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing (tachypnea). Loss of appetite. Vomiting. Lack of energy. Restlessness or fussiness. Signs you can look for in babies and young children include: Grunting sound with breathing or noisy breathing. A decreased amount of pee or diapers that are less wet. Pale skin. Limpness. Crying more than usual. Difficulty feeding. Symptoms of pneumonia in adults over 65 Adults over 65 or those with weakened immune systems may have mild or less noticeable symptoms of pneumonia (like cough and shortness of breath). Symptoms of ongoing health conditions may worsen. Older adults may experience: A sudden change in mental state. Low appetite. Fatigue. When to see a doctor FOR Pneumonia See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you\\'re coughing up pus. It\\'s especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor: Adults older than age 65 Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition. Diagnosis and Tests OF Pneumonia To diagnose pneumonia, a healthcare provider will ask about your health history and conduct a physical exam. They’ll listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and may perform or order additional tests. These include imaging (like chest X-rays), pulse oximetry (checking oxygen levels in your blood), blood tests or sputum (spit) tests. Even if your healthcare provider confirms that you have pneumonia, sometimes, they can’t find the exact cause. Your provider may perform tests that look at your lungs for signs of infection, measure how well your lungs are working and examine blood or other body fluids to try to determine the cause of your pneumonia. These include: Imaging: Your provider can use chest X-ray or CT scan to take pictures of your lungs to look for signs of infection. Blood tests: Your provider can use a blood test to help determine what kind of infection is causing your pneumonia. Sputum test: You’re asked to cough and then spit into a container to collect a sample for a lab to examine. The lab will look for signs of an infection and try to determine what’s causing it. Pulse oximetry: A sensor measures the amount of oxygen in your blood to give your provider an idea of how well your lungs are working. Pleural fluid culture: Your provider uses a thin needle to take a sample of fluid from around your lungs. The sample is sent to a lab to help determine what’s causing the infection. Arterial blood gas test: Your provider takes a blood sample from your wrist, arm or groin to measure oxygen levels in your blood to know how well your lungs are working. Bronchoscopy: In some cases, your provider may use a thin, lighted tube called a bronchoscope to look at the inside of your lungs. They may also take tissue or fluid samples to be tested in a lab. Management and Treatment OF Pneumonia Treatment for pneumonia depends on the cause — bacterial, viral or fungal — and how serious your case is. In many cases, the cause can’t be determined, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and making sure your condition doesn’t get worse. Some treatments may include: Antibiotics: Antibiotics treat bacterial pneumonia. They can’t treat a virus, but a provider may prescribe them if you have a bacterial infection at the same time as a virus. Antifungal medications: Antifungals can treat pneumonia caused by a fungal infection. Antiviral medications: Viral pneumonia usually isn’t treated with medication and can go away on its own. A provider may prescribe antivirals such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®) or peramivir (Rapivab®) to reduce how long you’re sick and how sick you get from a virus. Oxygen therapy: If you’re not getting enough oxygen, a provider may give you extra oxygen through a tube in your nose or a mask on your face. IV fluids: Fluids delivered directly to your vein (IV) treat or prevent dehydration. Draining of fluids: If you have a lot of fluid between your lungs and chest wall (pleural effusion), a provider may drain it. This is done with a catheter or surgery. Can pneumonia go away on its own? Viral pneumonia often goes away on its own, but you should always follow your healthcare provider’s recommendations to treat symptoms and reduce your risk of serious complications. How do I manage the symptoms of pneumonia? Over-the-counter medications and other at-home treatments can help you feel better and manage the symptoms of pneumonia, including: Pain relievers and fever reducers: Your provider may recommend medicines like ibuprofen (Advil®) and acetaminophen (Tylenol®) to help with body aches and fever. Cough suppressants: Check with your healthcare provider before taking cough suppressants for pneumonia. Coughing is important to help clear your lungs. Breathing treatments and exercises: Your provider may prescribe these treatments to help loosen mucus and help you to breathe. Using a humidifier: Your provider may recommend keeping a small humidifier running by your bed or taking a steamy shower or bath to make it easier to breathe. Drinking plenty of fluids. How soon after treatment for pneumonia will I begin to feel better? How soon you’ll feel better depends on: Your age. The cause of your pneumonia. The severity of your pneumonia. If you have other health conditions or complications. If you’re otherwise healthy, most symptoms of bacterial pneumonia usually begin to improve within 24 to 48 hours after starting treatment. You might start to feel better after a few days of treatment for viral pneumonia. Some symptoms, like cough and fatigue, may linger for several weeks. How long am I contagious if I have pneumonia? If you have bacterial pneumonia, you’re no longer considered contagious when your fever is gone and you’ve been on antibiotics for at least two days. If you have viral pneumonia, you’re still considered contagious until you feel better and have been free of fever for several days. Common Medications Used to Treat Pneumonia Antibiotics are used only for bacterial pneumonia. Viral pneumonia typically does not require antibiotics but may be treated with antivirals if caused by influenza. The choice of antibiotic depends on factors such as pneumonia type, severity, patient allergies, and local resistance patterns. Intravenous antibiotics may be necessary for severe pneumonia or hospitalized patients. Always follow your healthcare provider’s instructions regarding dosage and duration. Outlook / Prognosis OF Pneumonia If you’re otherwise healthy, you can recover quickly from pneumonia when you get prompt care. However, pneumonia can be life-threatening if left untreated, especially if you have an underlying health condition. Even people who’ve been successfully treated and have fully recovered may face long-term health issues. After recovering from pneumonia, you may experience: Decreased ability to exercise. Worsening of cardiovascular disease. General decline in quality of life. Children who’ve recovered from pneumonia have an increased risk of chronic lung diseases. Follow up with your healthcare provider if you have ongoing health concerns after recovering from pneumonia. Possible complications of pneumonia Pneumonia can lead to serious complications that can require hospitalization, including: Breathing difficulties. Pneumonia can lead to respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Fluid around your lungs (pleural effusion). Bacteria in your bloodstream (bacteremia), or sepsis. The bacteria that cause pneumonia can enter your bloodstream, spreading the infection to other organs and leading to sepsis or organ failure. Lung abscess. Pneumonia can lead to pus-filled holes in your lungs. When would I need to be hospitalized for pneumonia? If you have a severe case of pneumonia or complications, you may need to stay in the hospital for treatment. You’re more likely to be hospitalized for pneumonia if you’re: Under age 2 or over age 65. Have a weakened immune system. Have health conditions that affect your heart and lungs. It may take six to eight weeks to feel back to normal if you’ve been hospitalized with pneumonia. Prevention OF Pneumonia The best way to prevent pneumonia is to get vaccinated against bacteria and viruses that commonly cause it. There are also everyday precautions you can take to help reduce your risk of pneumonia. Vaccines for pneumonia There are two types of vaccines (shots) that prevent pneumonia caused by pneumococcal bacteria. Similar to a flu shot, these vaccines won’t protect against all types of pneumonia, but if you do get sick, it’s less likely to be severe. Pneumococcal vaccines: Pneumovax23® and Prevnar13® protect against pneumonia bacteria. They’re each recommended for certain age groups or those with increased risk for pneumonia. Ask your healthcare provider which vaccine would be appropriate for you or your loved ones. Vaccinations against viruses: As certain viruses can lead to pneumonia, getting vaccinated against COVID-19 and the flu can help reduce your risk of getting pneumonia. Childhood vaccinations: If you have children, ask their healthcare provider about other vaccines they should get. Several childhood vaccines help prevent infections caused by the bacteria and viruses that can lead to pneumonia. Other ways to reduce your risk of pneumonia In addition to getting vaccinated, you can reduce your risk of getting and spreading pneumonia with some healthy habits: Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke. Smoking damages your lungs and makes you more likely to get an infection. Wash your hands with soap and water before eating, before handling food and after using the restroom. If soap isn’t available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid close contact and sharing items with other people if either of you has an infectious disease such as the flu, a cold or COVID-19. If you have to stay in a hospital or other healthcare facility, don’t be afraid to ask your providers about how to reduce your risk of getting an infection during your stay. Eat a healthy diet, exercise and get enough rest. Get treated for any other infections or health conditions you may have. These conditions could weaken your immune system, which could increase your chance of pneumonia. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption. Living With Pneumonia You can help yourself feel better while you have pneumonia by: Managing your symptoms as recommended by your healthcare provider. Finishing all medications and therapies prescribed by your provider. Don’t stop taking antibiotics when you start feeling better. Continue taking them until no pills remain. If you don’t take all of your antibiotics, your pneumonia may come back. If your provider has recommended over-the-counter medicines to reduce fever (aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen), take them as directed on the label. Never give aspirin to children. Getting lots of rest. If at any time you start to feel worse, call your doctor right away. Signs that pneumonia is improving As you begin to recover from pneumonia, your temperature will probably return to normal first. After that, you may notice that you’re coughing up less mucus. Feeling like you’re up to returning to some of your normal activities is a good sign that you’re improving. When can I return to work, school and regular activities if I have pneumonia? You can typically resume your normal activities if your symptoms are gone, mild or improving and you don’t have new or worsening: Shortness of breath or tiredness (less energy). Chest pain. Mucus, fever or cough. If you’re generally healthy, most people feel well enough to return to previous activities in about a week. However, it may take about a month to feel totally back to normal. Diagnostic Considerations OF Pneumonia Pneumonia can occur at any age, although it is more common in younger children. Different age groups tend to be infected by different pathogens, which affects diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Many patients referred for evaluation for recurrent pneumonia are diagnosed with asthma. In emergency department studies, 35% of children with an asthma exacerbation have abnormalities visible on chest radiographs. In a child not yet diagnosed with asthma, these abnormalities are frequently interpreted simply as pneumonia. Inflammation, often triggered by viral infection, is part of the asthmatic response. Wheezing responsive to bronchodilators, a history of atopy, a family history of asthma, and a history of cough or wheeze with exercise may be helpful in identifying such patients. Consider any other diseases that may present with respiratory dysfunction in the first 24 hours of life. Keep in mind that any of the conditions listed below may also be superimposed by pneumonia: Alveolar-capillary dysplasia Arrhythmia Asphyxia Bronchial duplication Chest wall injury or anomaly Choanal atresia Chylothorax Diaphragmatic eventration Heart block Intracranial hemorrhage Laryngeal cleft Laryngeal nerve injury Mutation of ABCA3 gene (for surfactant phospholipid transport) Neuromuscular disorders Phrenic nerve injury Pulmonary hemorrhage Pulmonary hypoplasia Pulmonary lymphangiectasia Spinal injury Surfactant-related protein B deficiency Tachycardia syndromes Tracheoesophageal fistula Transplacental medications Vascular catheter accident Other causes of airway obstruction Other congenital heart diseases Other inborn errors of metabolism Other neuromuscular diseases A careful history and examination in patients with recurrent pneumonia are both very helpful to further narrow the differential diagnosis. However, additional testing is often needed to confirm most of these diagnoses and is generally outside the scope of a primary care provider.

Pneumonia accounts for 13% of all infectious illnesses in infants younger than 2 years of age. In a large community-based study conducted by Denny and Clyde, the annual incidence rate of pneumonia was 4 cases per 100 children in the preschool-aged group, 2 cases per 100 children aged 5-9 years, and 1 case per 100 children aged 9-15 years. Thompson et al reported that, after elderly persons, the second highest rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States were in children younger than 5 years of age. These investigators evaluated annual influenza-associated hospitalizations by hospital discharge category, discharge type, and age group. In a randomized double-blind trial, the heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine reduced the incidence of clinically diagnosed and radiographically diagnosed pneumonia among children younger than 5 years of age by 4% and 20%, respectively. Although the overall rate of pneumonia has decreased in the United States with the use of the 7-valent vaccine, the rate of empyema and complicated pneumonia has increased. [24] Following the use of the 13-valent conjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, the overall rates of pneumonia are anticipated to drop further. The new vaccine includes serotypes that have become associated with complicated or antibiotic-resistant disease (19A and 6A, for example). Among school-aged children and adolescents, bronchopneumonia occurs in 0.8-2% of all pertussis cases and 16-20% of hospitalized cases. M pneumoniae accounts for 14-35% of pneumonia hospitalizations in this age group, and mycobacterial pneumonia has recently been noted with increasing frequency in some inner-city areas, particularly among children in homeless shelters and group homes and those with household contacts. International statistics Pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of death worldwide. The WHO Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group estimated the median global incidence of clinical pneumonia to be 0.28 episodes per child-year. This corresponds to an annual incidence of 150.7 million new cases, of which 11-20 million (7-13%) are severe enough to require hospital admission. Ninety-five percent of all episodes of clinical pneumonia in young children worldwide occur in developing countries. Approximately 150 million new cases of pneumonia occur annually among children younger than 5 years of age worldwide. This accounts for approximately 10-20 million hospitalizations. A WHO Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group publication cited the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia among children younger than 5 years of age in developed countries as approximately 0.026 episodes per child-year. In addition, a study conducted in the United Kingdom showed that 59% of deaths from pertussis are associated with pneumonia. GENOMIC DATA OF Pneumonia Chlamydia psittaci: Metagenomic analysis reconstructed two near-complete genomes of C. psittaci strains from lung samples of pneumonia patients, showing high similarity (>97%) to known isolates. This helps understand strain variation and potential virulence genes involved in pneumonia caused by this pathogen. Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Real-time metagenomic sequencing has been used to rapidly identify P. aeruginosa in pneumonia patients. Whole-genome sequencing revealed numerous antibiotic resistance genes, such as the Mex efflux pump complex, which correlate with clinical resistance patterns. Klebsiella pneumoniae: Genome sequencing of K. pneumoniae isolates from pneumonia cases worldwide shows a wide genetic diversity including multiple antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and virulence factors like yersiniabactin, colibactin, and aerobactin. This genomic framework aids in tracking pandemic multidrug-resistant clones and understanding their pathogenicity. Streptococcus pneumoniae: Functional genomic approaches using CRISPR interference have identified key virulence genes driving pneumococcal pneumonia progression. This research sheds light on how S. pneumoniae interacts with viral infections (e.g., influenza) to worsen pneumonia severity. Metagenomic and 16S rRNA sequencing: These techniques enable culture-independent identification of bacterial communities in pneumonia, detecting pathogens in lung tissue or bronchoalveolar lavage samples, improving diagnostic accuracy and understanding of polymicrobial infections. Antimicrobial resistance genes: Genomic studies reveal widespread distribution of resistance genes across pneumonia pathogens, often localized on plasmids or chromosomes, highlighting the challenge of treating multidrug-resistant infections PREDEFINED Questions and answers FOR Pneumonia Is it possible to have pneumonia without having a fever? Yes, while fever is common in pneumonia, it’s possible to have pneumonia with a low fever or no fever. This is more likely if you: Are older than 65 or younger than 2 (especially newborns and infants). Have a weakened immune system. Is pneumonia treated any differently in children? Pneumonia isn’t usually treated any differently in children. However, young children can be at higher risk for severe illness from pneumonia. They’re more likely to be hospitalized for treatment than adults. Doctor patient conversation ON Pneumonia Doctor: Hello, I understand you’ve been feeling unwell. Can you tell me about your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I’ve had a cough for several days, and it’s been getting worse. I also have a fever and feel short of breath sometimes. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any chest pain, especially when you breathe deeply or cough? Patient: Yes, there is some sharp pain on the right side of my chest. Doctor: Based on your symptoms and your physical exam, it looks like you have pneumonia, which is an infection in your lungs. Patient: Is this serious? What causes pneumonia? Doctor: Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or sometimes fungi. It can range from mild to severe. Since you have fever, cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing, it’s important we treat it promptly. Patient: What treatment will I need? Doctor: I’m going to prescribe antibiotics to target the most common bacteria that cause pneumonia. You should take them exactly as directed, even if you start feeling better before finishing the course. Also, rest, drink plenty of fluids, and use over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever and discomfort. Patient: How long will it take for me to get better? Doctor: Most people start feeling better within 3 to 5 days, but the cough and fatigue can last several weeks. If your symptoms worsen or you develop new symptoms like difficulty breathing, high fever, or chest pain, please come back immediately. Patient: Should I avoid work or other activities? Doctor: Yes, it’s best to rest and avoid strenuous activities until you feel well. Also, avoid smoking or exposure to smoke, which can irritate your lungs. Patient: Do I need any follow-up? Doctor: We’ll schedule a follow-up in about a week to make sure you’re improving. If you have any concerns before then, don’t hesitate to contact us. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate the information. Doctor: You’re welcome. Take care and get well soon.

Fibrocystic Disease of the Pancreas Highlights the pancreatic involvement with fibrosis and cyst formation. Cystic Fibrosis of the Pancreas Emphasizes the pancreatic pathology, often used historically. Congenital Mucoviscidosis Refers to the hereditary nature of the disease and mucus abnormalities. CFTR-related Disorder A broader term encompassing cystic fibrosis and related conditions caused by mutations in the CFTR gene with variable symptoms DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a condition passed down in families that causes damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. CF affects the cells that make mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These fluids, also called secretions, are usually thin and slippery to protect the body\\'s internal tubes and ducts and make them smooth pathways. But in people with CF, a changed gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. The secretions plug up pathways, especially in the lungs and pancreas. CF gets worse over time and needs daily care, but people with CF usually can attend school and work. They often have a better quality of life than people with CF had in past decades. Better screening and treatments mean that people with CF now may live into their mid- to late 50s or longer, and some are being diagnosed later in life. CAUSES OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS In cystic fibrosis, a change in a gene causes problems with the protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. This gene is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. It affects the cells that make mucus, sweat and digestive juices. When the CFTR protein doesn\\'t work as it should, the result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as extra salt in sweat. Changes in the CFTR gene that cause CF are divided into several different groups based on the problems they cause. Different groups of gene changes affect how much CFTR protein is made and how well it works. To have cystic fibrosis, children must get one copy of the changed CFTR gene from each parent. If children get only one copy, they won\\'t develop CF. But they will be carriers and could pass the changed gene to their own children. People who are carriers may have no symptoms of CF or a few mild symptoms. Risk factors OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS Because cystic fibrosis is a condition passed down in families, family history is a risk factor. CF occurs in all races, but it\\'s most common in white people of Northern European ancestry. Because it\\'s less common in people who are Black, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Native American or Asian, this might lead to a much later diagnosis. A late diagnosis may cause worse health issues. Early and effective treatment can improve your quality of life, prevent complications and help you live longer. If you\\'re a person of color and have symptoms that could be CF, talk to your healthcare professional so that you can get tested for CF. Symptoms OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS In the U.S., because of newborn screening, cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. But people born before newborn screening became available may not be diagnosed until the symptoms of CF show up. CF symptoms vary, depending on which organs are affected and how severe the condition is. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or get better at different times. Some people may not have symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood. People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder symptoms and are more likely to have symptoms that aren\\'t typical. These may include repeated bouts of an inflamed pancreas called pancreatitis, infertility and repeated bouts of pneumonia. People with CF have a higher than usual level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other symptoms of CF affect the respiratory system and digestive system. Respiratory symptoms In cystic fibrosis, the lungs are most commonly affected. The thick and sticky mucus that happens with CF clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. This can cause symptoms such as: A cough that won\\'t go away and brings up thick mucus. A squeaking sound when breathing called wheezing. Limited ability to do physical activity before tiring. Repeated lung infections. Irritated and swollen nasal passages or a stuffy nose. Repeated sinus infections. Digestive symptoms The thick mucus caused by cystic fibrosis can block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from the pancreas to the small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, the intestines can\\'t completely take in and use the nutrients in food. The result is often: Foul-smelling, greasy stools. Poor weight gain and growth. Blocked intestines, which is more likely to happen in newborns. Ongoing or severe constipation. Straining often while trying to pass stool can cause part of the rectum to stick out of the anus. This is called a rectal prolapse. When to see a doctor FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis — or if someone in your family has CF — talk with your healthcare professional about testing for the condition. Make an appointment with a doctor who has skills and experience in treating CF. CF requires regular follow-up with your healthcare professional, at least every three months. Call your healthcare professional if you have new or worsening symptoms, such as more mucus than usual or a change in the mucus color, lack of energy, weight loss, or severe constipation. Get medical care right away if you\\'re coughing up blood, have chest pain or trouble breathing, or have severe stomach pain and bloating. Call 911 or your local emergency number or go to the emergency department at a hospital if: You\\'re having a hard time catching your breath or talking. Your lips or fingernails turn blue or gray. Others notice that you\\'re not mentally alert. DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS To diagnose cystic fibrosis, healthcare professionals typically do a physical exam, review your symptoms and do tests. Newborn screening and diagnosis Every state in the U.S. now routinely screens newborns for cystic fibrosis. Early diagnosis means that treatment can begin right away. Testing can include: Newborn screening. In this screening test, a healthcare professional takes a few drops of blood from the baby\\'s heel. A lab checks the blood sample for higher levels than expected of a chemical called immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT). IRT is released by the pancreas and may suggest CF. A newborn\\'s IRT levels also may be high because of premature birth or a stressful delivery. For that reason, other tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Sweat test. To check if a baby has CF, a sweat test is done once the baby is at least 2 weeks old. A chemical that causes the skin to sweat is put on a small area of skin. Then the sweat is collected to test it and see if it\\'s saltier than typical. Testing done at a care center accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation helps ensure results that can be trusted. Genetic testing. Healthcare professionals also may recommend genetic testing to look for specific changes on the gene responsible for CF. Genetic testing may be used along with IRT levels to confirm the diagnosis. Testing of older children and adults Cystic fibrosis tests may be recommended for older children and adults who weren\\'t screened at birth. Your healthcare professional may suggest genetic and sweat tests for CF if you have repeated bouts of an inflamed pancreas, nasal polyps, chronic sinus infections, lung infections, bronchiectasis or male infertility. Treatment OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but treatment can ease symptoms, lessen complications and improve quality of life. Close monitoring and early, aggressive intervention is recommended to slow the worsening of CF over time. This can lead to a longer life. Managing CF is complicated, so it\\'s best to get treatment at a center with a multispecialty team of doctors and other healthcare professionals trained in CF. They can evaluate and treat your condition. The goals of treatment include: Preventing and controlling infections that occur in the lungs. Removing and loosening mucus from the lungs. Treating and preventing intestinal blockage. Getting enough nutrition. Medicines FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS Options include: Medicines that target gene changes and improve how the CFTR protein works. These are called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CTFR) modulators. Antibiotics to treat and prevent lung infections. Anti-inflammatory medicines to lessen swelling in the airways in the lungs. Mucus-thinning medicines, such as hypertonic saline, to help cough up mucus. This can improve lung function. Medicines breathed into the lungs called bronchodilators. These can help keep airways open by relaxing the muscles around the bronchial tubes. Pancreatic enzyme capsules taken by mouth to help the digestive tract take in and use nutrients. Stool softeners to prevent constipation or bowel obstruction. Acid-reducing medicines to help pancreatic enzymes work better. Specific medicines for diabetes or liver disease, when needed. Medicines that target genes For those with cystic fibrosis who have certain gene changes, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators may help. About 90% of people with CF may be helped by using these medicines. Gene testing is needed to find out which specific gene change you have and if a CFTR modulator may work for you. CFTR modulators are newer medicines that many experts think are a breakthrough in the treatment of CF. The medicines help the CFTR protein work better. This can make lung function better, help digestion and weight, and lessen the amount of salt in sweat. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved these CFTR modulators for treating CF in people with specific changes in the CFTR gene: The newest combination medicine with elexacaftor, ivacaftor and tezacaftor (Trikafta) is approved for people age 2 years and older. Trikafta has been shown to be the most effective CFTR modulator. The combination medicine with ivacaftor and tezacaftor (Symdeko) is approved for people age 6 years and older. The combination medicine with ivacaftor and lumacaftor (Orkambi) is approved for people who are age 1 year and older. Ivacaftor (Kalydeco) is approved for people who are 1 month and older. Your healthcare professional may do liver function tests and eye exams before prescribing these medicines. While taking these medicines, you\\'ll likely need testing on a regular basis to check for side effects such as liver function changes and clouding of the eye lenses called cataracts. Ask your healthcare professional and pharmacist for information on possible side effects and what to watch for. Keep regular follow-up appointments so your healthcare professional can monitor you while taking these medicines. Tell your healthcare professional about any side effects that you have. Airway clearance techniques Airway clearance techniques, also called chest physical therapy, can help get rid of mucus blocking the airways. It also can help to lessen infection and inflammation in the airways. Airway clearance techniques loosen the thick mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up. Airway clearing techniques are usually done several times a day. Different techniques, and often more than one method, can be used to loosen and remove mucus. Clapping with cupped hands on the front and back of the chest. This is a common technique. Special breathing and coughing activities. Mechanical devices, such as a tube that you blow into, and a machine that pulses air into the lungs called a vibrating vest. Vigorous exercise. Your healthcare professional can give you instructions on the airway clearance techniques that are best for you and how often you should do them. Pulmonary rehabilitation Your healthcare professional may recommend a long-term program called pulmonary rehabilitation. The program may improve your lung function and your overall well-being. Pulmonary rehabilitation is usually done on an outpatient basis and may include: Physical exercise that may improve your condition. Breathing techniques that may help loosen mucus and make breathing easier. Dietary counseling. Mental health counseling and support. Education about your condition. Surgery and other treatments Options for certain conditions caused by cystic fibrosis include: Nasal and sinus surgery. Surgery can remove nasal polyps that get in the way of breathing. Sinus surgery may be done to treat repeated or long-term sinusitis. Oxygen therapy. If there isn\\'t enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. You can get this extra oxygen to your lungs through a mask or through plastic tubing with tips that fit into your nose. These attach to an oxygen tank. Lightweight, portable units that you take with you can help you be more mobile. Oxygen therapy may prevent high blood pressure in the lungs, a condition called pulmonary hypertension. Noninvasive ventilation. Typically used while sleeping, noninvasive ventilation uses a nose or mouth mask to give positive pressure in the airway and lungs when breathing in. It\\'s often used along with oxygen therapy. Noninvasive ventilation can increase air exchange in the lungs and lessen the work of breathing. The treatment also may help with airway clearance. Feeding tube. CF interferes with digestion, so you can\\'t take in and use nutrients from food very well. A feeding tube delivers extra nutrition. This may be a short-term tube placed through your nose and guided to your stomach. Or the tube may be surgically placed in the stomach through a small cut in the skin on your belly. A feeding tube gives extra calories during the day or night and does not keep you from eating by mouth. Bowel surgery. If a blockage happens in the intestines, you may need surgery to remove it. If part of an intestine folds inside a nearby section of intestine, you may need surgery. Lung transplant. If you have severe breathing problems or life-threatening lung complications, or if antibiotics no longer work to treat lung infections, a lung transplant may be an option. Because bacteria line the airways in diseases such as CF that cause permanent widening of the large airways, both lungs need to be replaced. Cystic fibrosis does not recur in transplanted lungs. But other complications linked with CF, such as sinus infections, diabetes, pancreas conditions and osteoporosis, can still happen after a lung transplant. Liver transplant. For severe CF-related liver disease, such as cirrhosis, liver transplant may be an option. In some people, a liver transplant may be done together with lung or pancreas transplants. Lifestyle and home remedies OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS Here are some ways you can manage cystic fibrosis and lessen complications. Pay attention to nutrition and fluid intake Cystic fibrosis can cause poor nutrition because the enzymes needed for digestion can\\'t reach the small intestine. This prevents food from being taken in and used by the body. People with CF may need a much higher number of calories daily than do people without the condition. A healthy diet is important to growth and development and to support good lung function. It\\'s also important to drink lots of fluids to help thin the mucus in your lungs. You may work with a dietitian to create a nutrition plan. Your healthcare professional may recommend: Pancreatic enzyme capsules with every meal and snack. Medicines to lessen acid made in the stomach and help pancreatic enzymes work. High-calorie nutrition supplements. Special fat-soluble vitamins. Extra fiber to prevent intestinal blockage. Extra salt, especially during hot weather or before exercising. Drinking enough water, especially during hot weather. Keep vaccinations up to date In addition to the other usual childhood vaccines, the annual flu vaccine is important if you have cystic fibrosis. So are any other vaccines your healthcare professionals recommend, such as the vaccine to prevent pneumonia and COVID-19. CF doesn\\'t affect the immune system, but people with CF are more likely to develop complications when they get sick. Exercise Regular exercise helps loosen mucus in your airways and makes your heart stronger. Because people with cystic fibrosis are living longer, it\\'s important to keep your heart and blood vessels in good shape for a healthier life. Anything that gets you moving, including walking and biking, can help. Stay away from smoke Don\\'t smoke, and don\\'t allow other people to smoke around you or your child. Secondhand smoke and air pollution are harmful for everyone, but especially if you have cystic fibrosis. Using electronic cigarettes, also called vaping, can worsen CF too. Wash your hands Teach all the members of your family to wash their hands thoroughly before eating, after using the bathroom, when coming home from work or school, and after being around a sick person. If possible, stay away from people who have colds or flu. Washing your hands is the best way to protect against infection. Keep medical appointments Along with ongoing care from your medical team: Keep your regular follow-up appointments. Take your medicines as prescribed and follow therapies as instructed. Talk with your healthcare professional about how to manage symptoms. Learn the warning signs of serious complications. Complications OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS Complications of cystic fibrosis can affect the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as other organs. Respiratory system complications Damaged airways. Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of damaged airways, a long-term lung condition called bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis results in widening and scarring of the airways. This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the airways. Ongoing infections. Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses makes a place for bacteria and fungi to live and grow. Sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia are common and may happen repeatedly. Infections with bacteria that don\\'t respond to antibiotics and are difficult to treat is common too. Growths in the nose. Because the lining inside the nose is irritated and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths called nasal polyps. Coughing up blood. Bronchiectasis can occur next to blood vessels in the lungs. The combination of airway damage and infection can result in coughing up blood. Often this is only a small amount of blood, but rarely it can be life-threatening. Collapsed lung. Also called pneumothorax, this condition happens when air leaks into the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall. This causes part or all of a lung to collapse. Collapsed lung is more common in adults with CF. Collapsed lung can cause sudden chest pain and trouble breathing. People often have a bubbling feeling in the chest. Respiratory failure. Over time, CF can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works. Lung function usually worsens slowly over time and can become life-threatening. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death with CF. Bouts of worsening symptoms. People with CF may experience times when respiratory symptoms are worse than usual. These are called exacerbations (eg-zas-er-bay-shuns). Symptoms may include coughing with more mucus than usual and trouble breathing. Low energy and weight loss also are common during exacerbations. Exacerbations are treated with antibiotics. Sometimes treatment can be given at home, but a stay in the hospital may be needed. Digestive system complications Poor nutrition. Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from the pancreas to the intestines. Without these enzymes, the body can\\'t take in and use protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins and can\\'t get enough nutrients. This can result in delayed growth and weight loss. An inflamed pancreas, a condition called pancreatitis, is common. Diabetes. The pancreas makes insulin, which the body needs to use sugar. Cystic fibrosis raises the risk of diabetes. About 20% of teenagers and up to 50% of adults with CF develop diabetes. Liver disease. The tube that carries bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine may become blocked and inflamed. This can lead to liver problems, such as jaundice, fatty liver disease and cirrhosis, and sometimes gallstones. Intestinal obstruction. Intestinal blockage can happen to people with CF at all ages. Sometimes, a condition in which a section of the intestine slides inside another nearby section of the intestine, like a collapsible telescope, also can happen. Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). DIOS is partial or complete blockage where the small intestine meets the large intestine. DIOS requires treatment right away. Reproductive system complications Infertility in men. Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are not fertile. The tube that connects the testicles and prostate gland, called the vas deferens, is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. Sperm is still made in the testicles even though it can\\'t pass into the semen made by the prostate gland. Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with CF to become biological parents. Lower fertility in women. Although women with CF may be less fertile than other women, it\\'s possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. Still, pregnancy can worsen the symptoms of CF. Talk with your healthcare professional about the risks. Other complications Thinning of the bones. Cystic fibrosis raises the risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones called osteoporosis. Joint pain, arthritis and muscle pain also may occur. Out of balance electrolytes and dehydration. CF causes saltier sweat, so the balance of minerals in the blood may be upset. This raises the risk for dehydration, especially with exercise or in hot weather. Symptoms of dehydration include a fast heartbeat, extreme tiredness, weakness and low blood pressure. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Stomach acid repeatedly flows back up into the tube connecting the mouth and stomach, called the esophagus. This backwash is known as acid reflux, and it can irritate the lining of the esophagus. Mental health conditions. Having an ongoing medical condition that has no cure may cause fear, depression and anxiety. Higher risk of digestive tract cancer. The risk of cancer of the esophagus, stomach, small and large bowel, liver, and pancreas is higher in people with cystic fibrosis. Regular colorectal cancer screening should begin at age 40. Outlook / Prognosis OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS Yes, cystic fibrosis can be life-threatening. Lung damage — from thick mucus and frequent lung infections — is the most common cause of death. What is the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis? Experts predict the life expectancy of someone born with cystic fibrosis in the past few years is around 50 years old. Improvements in treatment in recent years have increased this from a few years ago, when life expectancy was between 30 and 40 years old. People with atypical cystic fibrosis tend to have longer life expectancies than those with classic CF. What can I expect if I have cystic fibrosis? There’s no cure for CF. You or your child will need lifelong treatments to manage it. This includes treating infections, maintaining nutrition and seeing a CF specialist frequently. But new treatment methods help children who have CF live well into adulthood and have a better quality of life. Treatments work best when CF is diagnosed early, which is why newborn screening is so important. The addition of CFTR modulators at a young age may improve long-term health and increase life expectancy even more in the future. Prevention OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS If you or your partner have close relatives with cystic fibrosis, you both may choose to have genetic testing before having children. Testing done in a lab on a sample of blood can help find out your risk of having a child with CF. If you\\'re already pregnant and the genetic test shows that your baby may be at risk of CF, your healthcare professional can do other tests on your unborn child. Genetic testing isn\\'t for everyone. Before you decide to be tested, talk with a genetic counselor about the mental health impact the test results might have. Differential Diagnoses OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS Acute Sinusitis Bronchiolitis Nutritional Considerations in Failure to Thrive Pediatric Aspergillosis Pediatric Asthma Pediatric Bronchiectasis Pediatric Celiac Disease (Sprue) Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Short Stature Epidemiology OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal-recessive disease. Its estimated heterozygote frequency in White people is up to 1 in 20. Each offspring of 2 heterozygote parents has a 25% chance of developing cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal hereditary disease in the White population. In the United States, the prevalence is as follows: Whites of northern European origin - 1 case per 3200-3500 population Hispanics - 1 case per 9200-9500 population African Americans - 1 case per 15,000-17,000 population Asian Americans - 1 case per 31,000 population The worldwide incidence varies from 1 per 377 live births in parts of England to 1 per 90,000 Asian live births in Hawaii. The higher frequency in Asian American or African American populations compared with native Asians or Africans reflects White admixture. Race demographics The distribution of CFTR mutations varies according to the background of patients; for example, ΔF508 is the most common mutation found in the White population of northern European origin. Variability in clinical features between people of different races with same genotype has not been reported. Clinical manifestations are similar in Black and White populations, except that a poorer nutritional status is observed in Black patients. Black patients with cystic fibrosis are younger at diagnosis and have poorer nutritional status and pulmonary function than White patients with cystic fibrosis. Whether this is genetic or due to socioeconomic factors is unclear; low socioeconomic status is associated with significantly worse pulmonary outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis. Sex demographics Compared with males, females with cystic fibrosis have greater deterioration of pulmonary function with increasing age and younger mean age at death. Although it has been suggested that the increase in hormone secretion with puberty in females may interfere with the defense mechanisms of the immune system, thereby promoting progressive pulmonary involvement, the immune system in patients with cystic fibrosis is fundamentally intact. Genotyping OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS Genotype testing is recommended for individuals with a positive family history and for couples planning a pregnancy. It is not necessarily indicated for the general population. More than 1893 CF mutations have been identified. In the commercially available CF gene sequencing method, the entire coding region, splice junction sites, and promoter region of the CFTR gene are amplified from genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis on an automated capillary DNA sequencer. A finding of 2 CFTR mutations in association with clinical symptoms is diagnostic. This test can detect more than 98% of disease-causing mutations in Whites; the detection rate is lower in Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations. Therefore, failure to find 2 abnormal genes does not exclude the disease. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 4 next-generation gene sequencing devices for clinical use in CF. Two of the devices are used to screen and diagnose CF by detecting DNA changes in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene : the Illumina MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis 139-Variant Assay, which checks specific points in the patient\\'s CFTR gene sequence to detect known variants in the gene, and the Illumina MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay, which sequences a large portion of the CFTR gene to detect any difference in the CFTR gene compared with a reference CFTR gene. The other 2 FDA-approved devices are the Illumina MiSeqDx instrument platform, which analyzes the genes, and the Illumina Universal Kit reagents, which isolate and create copies of the genes of interest from patient blood samples. These 2 devices comprise the first FDA-regulated test system that allows laboratories to develop and validate sequencing of any part of a patient’s genome. PREDEFINED QUESTION AND ANSWERS FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS Q. Why can’t people with CF touch each other? A. Healthcare professionals usually recommend that people with cystic fibrosis aren’t in close contact with one another. This is because people with CF are more likely to get infections that other people fight off easily. They’re more likely to pass the germs on to others with CF (who also can’t fight them off easily). People with CF also should avoid anyone who’s sick. Q1. What are my treatment options? A.Medications: CFTR modulators (e.g., ivacaftor, lumacaftor/ivacaftor) target the defective CFTR protein to improve lung function. Antibiotics to treat and prevent lung infections. Anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce airway swelling. Mucus-thinning agents like hypertonic saline and dornase alfa to help clear mucus. Bronchodilators to open airways. Pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid digestion and nutrient absorption. Acid-reducing medications to improve enzyme effectiveness. Other medicines for complications like CF-related diabetes or liver disease. Airway clearance therapies: Chest physiotherapy and devices to loosen and remove mucus. Nutritional support: High-calorie, high-fat diet with vitamin supplements; sometimes tube feeding if needed. Surgery: Rarely, for complications like intestinal blockage or lung transplantation in advanced disease. Treatment is best managed at specialized CF centers with a multidisciplinary team. Q2. What’s a healthy eating plan I can follow? A. A high-calorie, high-protein, and high-fat diet is recommended to meet increased energy needs. Eat frequent meals and snacks to maintain weight and growth. Take pancreatic enzyme supplements with all meals and snacks to aid digestion. Include fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) supplements as advised by your healthcare team. Stay well hydrated. Work with a CF dietitian to tailor nutrition plans to your needs. Q3. What can I do to manage my symptoms? A. Perform daily airway clearance therapies to loosen mucus and improve breathing. Use prescribed inhaled medications regularly (mucolytics, bronchodilators, antibiotics). Avoid lung irritants like smoke and pollution. Get regular exercise to improve lung function and overall health. Monitor symptoms closely and report any worsening promptly. Stay up to date with vaccinations, including flu and pneumonia vaccines. Q4. What signs of infection should I look out for? A. Increased cough or change in cough character (more frequent, productive, or bloody). Increased shortness of breath or wheezing. Fever or chills. Increased fatigue or decreased exercise tolerance. Changes in sputum color or amount. Chest pain or discomfort. Loss of appetite or weight loss. Q5. When should I follow up with you? A. Regular follow-up visits are essential, often every 3 months or as advised by your CF care team. Immediately if you notice worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, or other signs of infection. Before starting any new medications or therapies. For routine monitoring of lung function, nutrition, and complications. Q6. What symptoms should I go to the ER for? A. Severe difficulty breathing or shortness of breath at rest. Persistent high fever not responding to medications. Chest pain or sudden worsening of cough. Blue or gray discoloration of lips, face, or fingertips (signs of low oxygen). Severe dehydration (little or no urine output, dizziness). Confusion or extreme lethargy. Q7. Should other family members get tested? A. Yes, family members can be carriers of CFTR mutations even if they do not have symptoms. Genetic counseling and testing are recommended for siblings and reproductive partners to assess carrier status and reproductive risks. Early diagnosis in family members can improve management and outcomes. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON CYSTIC FIBROSIS Doctor: Hello! I see you’ve been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. How are you feeling about this news? Patient: It’s a lot to take in. I’m worried about what this means for my health and daily life. Doctor: That’s completely understandable. CF is a complex condition, but with current treatments and a good care team, many people live full lives. Our goal is to manage symptoms, prevent infections, and maintain your lung and nutritional health. Patient: What kind of treatments will I need? Doctor: You’ll likely use several therapies daily, including airway clearance techniques to help clear mucus, inhaled medications like mucolytics and bronchodilators, and pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid digestion. There are also newer medications called CFTR modulators that target the underlying genetic defect, which can improve lung function. Patient: That sounds like a lot. How often will I need to see you or the care team? Doctor: Regular visits every 3 months are important to monitor lung function, nutrition, and infections. We’ll do breathing tests and sometimes imaging to track your lungs. You’ll also have access to a multidisciplinary team including respiratory therapists, dietitians, and social workers. Patient: What can I do day-to-day to manage my symptoms? Doctor: Daily airway clearance, taking your medications as prescribed, staying active with exercise, and maintaining a high-calorie, nutritious diet are key. Also, avoid lung irritants like smoke and stay up to date with vaccinations. Patient: What signs should I watch for that mean I need to come in sooner? Doctor: If you notice increased cough, more mucus or a change in its color, shortness of breath, fever, chest pain, or fatigue, contact us promptly. These may indicate an infection or exacerbation. Patient: Should my family members get tested? Doctor: Yes, CF is genetic. Family members can be carriers even if they don’t have symptoms. Genetic counseling and testing can help assess risks for relatives and future children. Patient: How do you usually communicate with patients about CF? It’s a lot to understand. Doctor: We tailor communication to your needs, provide written materials, and encourage questions. We want you to feel supported and involved in your care decisions. You can always reach out between visits if you have concerns.

Neonatal Chronic Lung Disease Highlights the chronic nature of lung injury starting in the neonatal period. Infantile Chronic Lung Disease Another term referring to chronic lung issues in infants, often synonymous with BPD. Oxygen-Dependent Lung Disease of Prematurity Describes the need for prolonged oxygen therapy in affected infants. Pulmonary Dysplasia of Prematurity A less common variant term focusing on lung development abnormalities. DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a lung disorder that can affect preterm babies. When a baby is born early, their lungs are underdeveloped. Because of this, they may need long-term oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation to help them breathe. While these therapies can save your infant’s life, they can also overstretch the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in their lung tissue. This can damage your infant’s lungs and airways (bronchi) over time, causing tissue destruction (dysplasia). The earlier your baby is born, the greater their risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The severity of the condition can vary. While most babies recover from BPD, some may have a lifetime of breathing difficulties and other complications. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia causes When your baby is born early, they sometimes need help breathing because their lungs are underdeveloped. This means your baby may need to be on a ventilator. The ventilator provides oxygen and pressure to help your baby’s lungs expand and support their breathing. Your baby’s lungs are vulnerable right after birth, and the delivery of oxygen and pressure can overstretch their fragile air sacs (alveoli). This can lead to inflammation and damage to their lung tissue over time. Risk factors OF Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) Newborns who are especially at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia include: Babies born more than 10 weeks early Babies who weigh less than 2 pounds at birth Babies with underdeveloped lungs or breathing problems It’s rare for babies born after 32 weeks to develop BPD. Signs and symptoms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia Signs and symptoms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) vary widely but can include: A blue tone of a white baby’s skin and lips, or a yellow-gray, gray or white tone in newborns of color (cyanosis) Difficulty breathing (respiratory distress) Low oxygen levels in your baby’s blood Pauses in breathing (apnea) Rapid breathing (tachypnea) Wheezing When should my baby see their healthcare provider? After treatment, your baby should see their healthcare provider if they have: Chronic cough Chronic snoring Difficulty eating Flaring nostrils during each breath Heavy, quick breathing Symptoms of a viral illness, like fever, sneezing or coughing Wheezing Visit the emergency room or call 911 immediately if your baby stops breathing, has trouble breathing or if their skin or lips become discolored. Diagnosis and Tests OF Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) If your baby is born preterm and needs help breathing for the first 28 days of their life, their healthcare provider will likely diagnose them with BPD. There are no specific tests to diagnose the condition. But some tests that can suggest and help manage the diagnosis include: Blood tests to identify how much oxygen is in your baby’s blood Imaging tests, like a chest X-ray, to look at your baby’s lungs Management and Treatment OF Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) There’s no cure for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. But treatment reduces the risk of further lung damage and helps your baby’s lungs grow and heal. The goal of bronchopulmonary dysplasia treatment is to wean your baby off supplemental oxygen as soon as possible. Treatment improves your baby’s lung function and their ability to breathe on their own. Treatment may include: Nutrition. Increasing the amount of calories your baby takes in can help their lungs grow. Diuretics. Diuretics help reduce the amount of fluid in and around your baby’s lungs. Bronchodilators. Bronchodilators help relax the muscles around your baby’s airways, making breathing easier. Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids help reduce or prevent inflammation in and around your baby’s lungs. Nirsevimab. Nirsevimab (or palivizumab) helps prevent viral infections like RSV in babies. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). An nCPAP machine gently pushes air into your baby’s lungs through special prongs placed in their nose. Tracheostomy. If your baby has a severe case of BPD, their provider may surgically insert this tube into your baby’s windpipe to help them breathe. After treatment, your baby’s health will gradually improve over several months. During this time, their lungs will continue to heal and grow, with the goal of breathing on their own. TREATMENT DRUGS AND THEIR SIDE EFFECTS 1. Diuretics Purpose: Reduce fluid accumulation in and around the alveoli to improve lung function. Common drugs: Furosemide (loop diuretic), Chlorothiazide, Hydrochlorothiazide, Spironolactone. Administration: Usually given orally 1-4 times daily. Side effects: Electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, sodium), dehydration, kidney dysfunction, increased urination. 2. Bronchodilators Purpose: Relax airway muscles to widen air passages and ease breathing. Common drugs: Albuterol (salbutamol), Levalbuterol, Ipratropium bromide. Administration: Usually inhaled via nebulizer or inhaler with spacer. Side effects: Tremors, increased heart rate, nervousness, potential worsening of tracheomalacia. 3. Corticosteroids Purpose: Reduce lung inflammation, swelling, and mucus production. Common drugs: Dexamethasone, Hydrocortisone (systemic); Budesonide, Fluticasone (inhaled). Administration: Systemic (IV or oral) or inhaled aerosols. Side effects: Growth suppression, immune suppression, increased infection risk, hypertension, hyperglycemia, potential neurodevelopmental effects (especially with systemic steroids). 4. Surfactant Therapy Purpose: Improve lung compliance and reduce surface tension in alveoli. Common drugs: Poractant alfa (Curosurf), Calfactant (Infasurf), Beractant (Survanta). Administration: Intratracheal instillation, mainly in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. Side effects: Rare but can include transient bradycardia or oxygen desaturation during administration. 5. Caffeine Citrate Purpose: Stimulates respiratory drive, prevents apnea of prematurity, reduces inflammation. Side effects: Irritability, tachycardia, feeding intolerance. 6. Pulmonary Vasodilators (for BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension) Common drugs: Sildenafil, Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), Bosentan. Side effects: Hypotension, headache, liver enzyme abnormalities (bosentan), bleeding risk (iNO). 7. Macrolide Antibiotics (Research Use) Purpose: Anti-inflammatory effects and activity against Ureaplasma species. Common drugs: Azithromycin, Clarithromycin. Side effects: Gastrointestinal upset, potential antibiotic resistance concerns. Complications of bronchopulmonary dysplasia Most infants recover from BPD by the time they’re 5 years old. But they’re at risk of developing other health conditions, including: Feeding difficulties Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Learning disabilities and disorders Neurological disorders Problems with hearing or vision Pulmonary hypertension Some children and adults who had the condition as newborns are at risk of developing certain lung complications. These include: Asthma Bronchitis Obstructive sleep apnea Pneumonia Reactive airway disease Severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections Outlook / Prognosis OF Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) Your baby’s lungs will continue to develop after they leave the hospital. Their lungs will still be vulnerable, and it’s important to keep them as healthy as possible. You can do this by: Avoiding people who have respiratory tract infections, including RSV Getting all family members vaccinated against the flu Keeping your baby away from secondhand smoke and fumes (especially from cigarettes) Your baby may experience feeding difficulties, which could lead to growth faltering. Taking your baby to all scheduled appointments is very important to address these issues sooner. Because babies with bronchopulmonary dysplasia are born early, they can experience a delay in their developmental milestones. Most babies will catch up with various therapies, including physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. Severe cases of bronchopulmonary dysplasia can be life-threatening. But most babies survive, with their health gradually improving as they get older and gain weight. Prevention OF Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) If you’re pregnant, it’s important to keep yourself healthy and take steps to avoid preterm labor. The risk of having a baby with BPD significantly reduces if the fetus’s lungs have enough time to develop. You can reduce your risk of having your baby preterm by: Avoiding tobacco, recreational drugs and alcohol while you’re pregnant Eating healthy and nutritious foods Getting regular prenatal check-ups throughout your pregnancy Minimizing stress Diagnostic Considerations OF Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) Consider airway injury, nosocomial infection, and subglottic stenosis in the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Associated confounding problems in infants with BPD can be severe, and delayed diagnosis can be catastrophic. For example, if an infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and superimposed sepsis is treated with systemic corticosteroids, the infant may have serious complications or death. When steroids (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone) are administered with indomethacin, the risk of spontaneous intestinal perforation is significantly increased. Careful discussions between parents and caregivers should be undertaken before corticosteroids are given to high-risk infants. Brain growth in preterm infants may also be adversely affected by severe BPD. In a study that used magnetic resonance imaging to assess the segmented brain volumes of 63 preterm infants (42 with severe BPD; 21 without severe BPD) at term equivalent age and at 18 months of corrected age and compared their brain volume and brain growth velocity, Iwanaga et al found no significant difference in brain volumes at term equivalent age between the severe-BPD and non-severe BPD infants. However, at 18 months of corrected age, the infants with severe BPD had significantly smaller brain volumes of the total brain and cerebral white matter, as well as lower brain growth velocities from term equivalent age to 18 months of corrected age in the total brain, cerebral cortex, and cerebral white matter. Differential Diagnoses OF Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) Pediatric Hypertension Pediatric Pneumonia Pulmonary Atelectasis Tracheomalacia Epidemiology OF Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) United States data Infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia are often extremely immature and have very low birth weight, although term infants with severe respiratory failure are also at increased risk. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is uncommon in infants with a birth weight of more than 1250 g and in infants who were born at more than 30 weeks\\' gestation. Overall, about one fourth of infants who weigh less than 1500 g are diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. About half of infants born at less than 30 weeks\\' gestation have bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Antenatal gluco corticosteroids, early surfactant therapy, and gentle modalities of ventilation have minimized the severity of lung injury, particularly in relatively mature infants. However, improved survival has increased the prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, especially in small infants who may have been exposed to in utero infection (e.g., chorioamnionitis). Several trials of surfactants revealed that incidences of bronchopulmonary dysplasia widely vary, from 17% to 57%. No substantial difference between placebo-treated and surfactant-treated survivors has been reported. Kresch and Clive performed a meta-analysis of surfactant-replacement therapy for infants weighing less than 2 kg. Infants receiving modified natural surfactant had improved survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Van Marter and associates described the wide variation in the prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in different NICUs using various ventilatory strategies. This variation has also been noted among sites in the Vermont Oxford Network (VON) and in the NICHD research network, suggesting that differences in patient populations and clinical practices may directly affect outcomes. International data Studies like those in the United States have been conducted to compare rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in different NICUs in Europe. Results have been similar despite the relatively homogeneous population. Race-, sex-, and age-related demographics Compared with white infants, African American infants generally have a lower incidence of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, although the combined rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and death is often similar in persons of different races. Male infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia tend to have more severe disease and worse neurodevelopmental outcome. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is most common in the most immature neonates born at 22-30 weeks\\' gestational age. These patients frequently weigh less than 1000 g at birth. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q1. What is Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD)? A. BPD is a chronic lung condition that mostly affects premature infants who needed prolonged oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation. It causes scarring and inflammation in the lungs, leading to breathing difficulties that can persist beyond infancy. Q2. How long does BPD last? A. Symptoms of BPD are usually most severe in infancy and early childhood. Many children see improvement by age 2 to 3 years, and treatment often ends by age 5. However, lung development may remain abnormal, and some may experience lung problems or asthma-like symptoms into adulthood. Q3. What treatments are available for BPD? A. There is no cure, but treatment focuses on supporting lung function and minimizing further damage. This includes: Oxygen therapy at home as needed Diuretics to reduce lung fluid Bronchodilators and inhaled steroids to open airways and reduce inflammation Nutritional support and feeding assistance Regular monitoring by pediatric lung specialists Preventive vaccinations to reduce infections. Q4. What care is needed after hospital discharge? A. Babies with BPD often require ongoing oxygen therapy and medications at home. Caregivers should monitor breathing, avoid exposure to smoke and infections, and follow up closely with healthcare providers. Feeding difficulties and growth delays may also need management. Q5. What complications can occur with BPD? A. Complications may include: Apnea (pauses in breathing) Feeding difficulties requiring tube feeding Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in lung vessels) Neurologic, vision, or hearing problems in severe cases Increased susceptibility to respiratory infections and hospitalizations. 6. How can I support my child’s lung health? Ensure timely vaccinations, including flu and RSV prevention Practice good hand hygiene to reduce infections Avoid exposure to tobacco smoke and other lung irritants Follow prescribed therapies and attend regular check-ups with specialists. Q7. When should I seek medical help for my child? A. Seek prompt care if your child has: Increased difficulty breathing or rapid breathing Persistent or worsening wheezing or cough High fever or signs of infection Poor feeding or dehydration Blue discoloration of lips or face. Q8. Can BPD be prevented? A. While not all cases can be prevented, risks are reduced by: Preventing premature birth through healthy pregnancy care Administering antenatal steroids (like betamethasone) to help lung maturity if preterm birth is expected Minimizing lung injury from ventilation and oxygen therapy in the NICU. Q9. What support is available for families? A. Many hospitals offer specialized BPD programs with multidisciplinary teams to support families. Support groups and resources like the American Lung Association’s Lung Help Line can provide guidance and emotional support DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) Doctor: Hello, I want to talk with you about your baby’s lung condition called bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or BPD. This is a chronic lung disease that affects many premature infants who require oxygen or ventilation support. Parent: What exactly is BPD? Is it serious? Doctor: BPD happens because the lungs are still developing when babies are born too early. The oxygen and ventilation they need to survive can sometimes cause inflammation and scarring in the lungs. It can make breathing harder and increase the risk of infections. It is serious, but with good care, many babies improve over time. Parent: What kind of treatments will my baby need? Doctor: Treatment focuses on supporting your baby’s breathing and nutrition. This may include oxygen therapy, medications like diuretics and bronchodilators to help the lungs work better, and careful nutritional support to promote growth. We also monitor closely to prevent and treat infections. Sometimes babies need feeding tubes if they have trouble eating. Parent: Will my baby need to stay in the hospital a long time? Doctor: It depends on the severity. Some babies need prolonged hospital stays, but many go home with oxygen support and close outpatient follow-up. We have specialized clinics where experts monitor lung health and development after discharge. Parent: What signs should I watch for that mean my baby is having trouble? Doctor: Watch for increased work of breathing like fast breathing, chest retractions, grunting, or if your baby becomes more tired or feeds poorly. Also, any fever or change in color, such as bluish lips, should prompt immediate medical attention. Parent: Can my baby fully recover from BPD? Doctor: Many infants improve significantly as their lungs grow and mature, especially in the first few years. However, some may have ongoing lung issues like asthma or increased risk of respiratory infections. That’s why regular follow-up is important. Parent: Is there anything I can do to help at home? Doctor: Yes, avoid exposure to smoke or sick contacts, keep up with vaccinations including flu and RSV prevention, and follow the treatment plan closely. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Parent: Thank you. It’s reassuring to know there’s a plan. Doctor: You’re doing a great job caring for your baby. Please call us anytime if you have concerns or questions.

Chronic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure Refers specifically to chronic respiratory failure characterized by low oxygen levels (hypoxemia). Chronic Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure Describes chronic respiratory failure with elevated carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia). Type 1 Respiratory Failure (Chronic) Primarily hypoxemic respiratory failure without hypercapnia. Type 2 Respiratory Failure (Chronic) Respiratory failure with both hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Chronic Ventilatory Failure Highlights failure of the ventilatory pump function over time. End-Stage Respiratory Failure Used in advanced disease when respiratory failure is irreversible and severe. DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE As chronic respiratory failure progresses, you may have symptoms such as difficulty breathing. It’s serious, and the underlying cause doesn’t always have a cure. However, treatments are available to help you manage the symptoms. Respiratory failure Respiratory failure is a condition where you don’t have enough oxygen in the tissues in your body (hypoxia) or when you have too much carbon dioxide in your blood (hypercapnia). You might also hear people use the term “acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF)” to describe it. Respiratory failure is often a medical emergency. Call 911 or seek medical attention right away if you think you’re experiencing respiratory failure. How respiration works You can think of respiration as passengers traveling from the air to your tissues. When you breathe in, oxygen molecules travel to your lungs — the passengers arriving at the airport. The oxygen passengers arrive at the “airport gates” — small air sacs around your lungs called alveoli — and are picked up by your blood. They travel through your blood to their destination in your tissues, like your organs and muscles. You need oxygen to reach its destination to stay alive. After your blood cells drop off oxygen in your tissues, they have room to pick up carbon dioxide. Your body doesn’t need carbon dioxide (it’s a waste product). If too much of it builds up, there isn’t room in your blood’s transportation system to deliver oxygen. Your blood circulates through your body, back to your lungs, where it drops off carbon dioxide. When you breathe out, you get rid of the unnecessary waste to make room for more oxygen. If any parts of this system fail, you won’t have enough oxygen to keep your tissues healthy. Types of respiratory failure Respiratory failure can come on suddenly (acute) or over time (chronic). There are two common types: hypoxemic respiratory failure (type 1) and hypercapnic respiratory failure (type 2). Other types include perioperative (related to surgery) respiratory failure (type 3) and respiratory failure due to shock (type 4). Hypoxemic respiratory failure Hypoxemic respiratory failure happens when you don’t have enough oxygen in your blood (hypoxemia). Heart and lung conditions are the most common causes. Hypoxemic respiratory failure is also called hypoxic respiratory failure. Hypercapnic respiratory failure Hypercapnic respiratory failure happens when you have too much carbon dioxide (CO2) in your blood. If your body can’t get rid of carbon dioxide, a waste product, there isn’t room for your blood cells to carry oxygen. The most common causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure include heart, lung, muscle and neurological (brain and spinal cord) conditions. Certain medications can also cause it. Hypercapnic respiratory failure is also called hypercarbic respiratory failure. Perioperative respiratory failure Perioperative respiratory failure can happen when you have surgery. Anesthesia (medication that keeps you asleep) can keep you from breathing properly. Sometimes, air sacs in your lungs can collapse (atelectasis) and keep oxygen from getting into your blood. Respiratory failure due to shock Shock is a condition that causes low blood pressure, fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) and other issues that can lead to respiratory failure. Sepsis, cardiac events (like a heart attack) and blood loss can cause shock. causes OF respiratory failure Respiratory failure happens when something keeps your body from getting oxygen into your blood or getting carbon dioxide out of your blood. This can be due to: Too little airflow or blood flow to your lungs. Blockages, scarring or fluid in your lungs. Inability to breathe properly or deeply enough. Conditions that affect your lungs, issues with the nerves or muscles you use to breathe, or injuries to your chest can cause this. Abnormalities in the way blood flows through your heart. Risk factors for respiratory failure Risk factors for respiratory failure include: Lung conditions and diseases. This includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, asthma, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary fibrosis. Heart or circulatory (blood flow) conditions and diseases. This includes heart attack, congenital heart disease, heart failure and shock. Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that help you breathe. This includes muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), severe scoliosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Chest, spinal cord or brain injuries (including stroke). Smoking or exposure to other lung irritants. This includes chemical fumes, dust and asbestos. Surgery that requires sedation or anesthesia. Drug use or excessive alcohol consumption. Age. Newborn babies (especially premature infants) and adults over 65 are at higher risk for respiratory failure. symptoms of respiratory failure Symptoms of respiratory failure depend on the cause. Symptoms may include: Shortness of breath or feeling like you can’t get enough air (dyspnea). Rapid breathing (tachypnea). Extreme tiredness (fatigue). Fast heart rate (feeling like your heart’s racing) or heart palpitations. Spitting or coughing blood or bloody mucus (hemoptysis). Excessive sweating. Restlessness. Pale skin. Bluish skin, lips or nails (cyanosis). Headaches. Blurred vision. Agitation, confusion or being unable to think straight. Behavioral changes, not acting like yourself. When should I see a healthcare provider? Talk to a healthcare provider if you have a chronic condition that puts you at risk for respiratory failure. They can tell you what signs and symptoms of respiratory failure to look out for and how to manage your condition. Go to the nearest emergency room or call 911 if you have symptoms of respiratory failure. It can be fatal if not treated quickly. causes chronic respiratory failure Certain lung diseases can cause chronic respiratory failure. Conditions that affect how the brain, muscles, bones, or surrounding tissues support breathing can also cause chronic respiratory failure. Diseases and conditions that commonly lead to chronic respiratory failure include: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) emphysema complicated pneumonia obesity hypoventilation syndrome, a type of breathing disorder that’s associated with low blood oxygen levels cystic fibrosis injury to the chest spinal cord injuries stroke muscular dystrophy amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), better known as Lou Gehrig’s disease drug or alcohol misuse Smoking is another possible cause. Diagnosis and Tests OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE A doctor will be able to diagnose chronic respiratory failure by performing a physical exam and asking about your symptoms and medical history. They may also run certain tests to confirm the diagnosis. Often an ongoing illness or significant injury has occurred prior to the development of chronic respiratory failure. Physical examination During a physical exam, the doctor will use a stethoscope to listen for unusual sounds in your lungs and heart. Medical history The doctor will ask you about lung diseases or conditions you currently have or have had in the past. Pulse oximetry test Pulse oximetry is a simple and painless test that evaluates how well oxygen is being sent to various parts of the body. The doctor will place a small sensor on the tip of your finger or ear lobe to determine whether you’re getting enough oxygen. In healthy people, the normal oxygen saturation range will be between 95% and 100%, according to Stat Pearls. The American Thoracic Society states that any percentage under 89% indicates an abnormally low oxygen level. Arterial blood gas test An arterial blood gas test is a safe and easy procedure that measures the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in your blood. It also measures the pH, or acidity level, of your blood. The doctor will draw blood from an artery in your wrist. They’ll then send the blood to a lab for analysis. The results of this test indicate carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in your blood as well as its overall chemistry. Imaging tests The doctor can use a chest X-ray or CT scan to obtain a better view of your lungs. Bronchoscopy A bronchoscope is a thin, flexible lighted instrument that can be inserted into your lungs and airways. Doctors can use bronchoscopy to get a closer look at the lung passages as well as to take samples of airway and lung tissue. Management and Treatment OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE Although acute respiratory failure is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital, chronic respiratory failure can be managed at home, depending on its cause. In severe cases, medical professionals can help you manage the condition in a long-term healthcare center. Treatment options typically include: addressing the underlying cause of your respiratory failure (perhaps with medications) removing excess carbon dioxide from the blood increasing oxygen levels in the blood Some treatments are detailed below. Oxygen therapy You may receive oxygen therapy if you don’t have enough oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy raises your oxygen levels by increasing the amount of oxygen you inhale. Oxygen is distributed from a tank through a tube. The gas enters your lungs through a face mask, nasal tubes, or one larger tube directly inserted into your windpipe. There are small, portable oxygen machines that you can carry in a shoulder bag. Tracheostomy In severe cases of chronic respiratory failure, you may need a tracheostomy. During this procedure, a surgeon places a tube in your windpipe so you can breathe more easily. The tube is inserted through a cut in the front of your neck where your windpipe is located. This tube can be temporary or permanent. Mechanical ventilation If chronic respiratory failure doesn’t improve with other treatments, the doctor may put you on a ventilator or breathing machine. This machine pumps oxygen through a tube that’s inserted into your mouth or nose and extends down into your windpipe. Since the ventilator blows air directly into your lungs, you don’t have to work as hard to breathe oxygen in on your own. Depending on the severity of your condition, you may only need the ventilator to help you with breathing, or you may need the ventilator to do all of the breathing for you. Other forms of breathing assistance, known as noninvasive ventilation (NIV), include bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines. These may be appropriate long-term options for people with certain conditions, like COPD. How is respiratory failure treated? How providers treat respiratory failure depends on how severe it is and what’s causing it. Treatments focus on managing the underlying cause, giving you more oxygen, or using mechanical ventilation to breathe for you until you’re able to on your own again. Acute respiratory failure is an emergency and needs to be treated right away. Mild chronic respiratory failure can often be treated at home by managing the condition that’s causing it. Specific treatments for respiratory failure Providers may use medications or procedures to treat respiratory failure, including: Mechanical ventilation. Providers use a breathing machine and a tube that goes into your airways to move air in and out of your lungs. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Providers use a bypass machine to add oxygen to your blood and remove carbon dioxide. Oxygen therapy. A machine delivers extra oxygen through a breathing mask or small tube (cannula). You may get oxygen at home or in the hospital. Fluids. Your provider can give you fluids through an IV (directly to a vein). This can improve the blood flow through your body, bringing more oxygen to your tissues. Managing underlying conditions. You provider may treat you with other medications or procedures, depending on what’s causing respiratory failure. Outlook / Prognosis OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE There often isn’t any cure for chronic respiratory failure, but you can manage your symptoms with treatment. Your specific outlook depends on the exact cause of your respiratory failure, your overall health, and how quickly you receive treatment. If you have a chronic lung disease, you may need continuous help with your breathing. Respiratory failure is a very serious condition. Many people survive it, depending on what’s causing it, the severity and how quickly they’re treated. While many causes of acute respiratory failure are treatable, it can be fatal if not treated quickly. Up to 1 in 3 people who are hospitalized for acute respiratory failure don’t survive. Chronic respiratory failure is usually caused by an ongoing condition that gets worse over time. Prevention OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE You can’t always prevent respiratory failure. You can lower your risk of chronic respiratory failure by managing ongoing heart, lung and neurological conditions. Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to reduce your risk if you have a condition that can cause respiratory failure. Diagnostic Considerations OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE Respiratory failure is a common and a life-threatening condition that demands prompt diagnosis and assessment and appropriate management. Failure to visualize an obvious abnormality on chest radiographs in hypoxemic respiratory failure suggests the possibility of right-to-left shunting. The vast majority of patients in acute respiratory failure due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema respond to measures to reduce preload and afterload. Those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) require early elective intubation because the duration of respiratory failure is longer. Hypercapnic respiratory failure occurs secondary to a variety of causes, including an increased respiratory muscle load, impaired neuromuscular function, and decreased respiratory drive caused by central nervous system (CNS) depression. Differential Diagnoses OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Angina Pectoris Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Asthma Atelectasis Bacterial Pneumonia Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema Cardiogenic Shock Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) Cor Pulmonale Cyanosis Diaphragmatic Paralysis Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) Distributive Shock Emphysema Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) Interstitial (Nonidiopathic) Pulmonary Fibrosis Mechanical Ventilation Myocardial Infarction Neurogenic Pulmonary Edema Noninvasive Ventilation Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Pneumothorax Imaging Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Respiratory Acidosis Restrictive Lung Disease Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Viral Pneumonia Epidemiology OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE Respiratory failure is a syndrome rather than a single disease process, and the overall frequency of respiratory failure is not well known. The estimates for individual diseases mentioned in this article can be found in the Medscape Reference articles specific to each disease. The relationship between acute respiratory failure and race is still debated. A study by Khan et al suggested that no differences in mortality exist in patients of Asian and Native Indian descent with acute critical illness after adjusting for differences in case mix. [1] Moss and Mannino reported worse outcome for African Americans with ARDS than for whites after adjustment for case mix. Future prospective association studies should yield a better knowledge of the impact of race on the outcome of respiratory failure. Guidelines Summary OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE Guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome published by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) contain the following key recommendations regarding the management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF): Patients with AHRF not due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or acute exacerbation of COPD should receive high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNO) as compared to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) to reduce the risk of intubation Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) can be considered instead of HFNO for the treatment of AHRF due to COVID-19 to reduce the risk of intubation No recommendations could be made for or against the following treatments: Use of HFNO compared to CPAP/NIV to treat AHRF in unselected patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure not due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or acute exacerbation of COPD Use of NIV compared to CPAP for the treatment of AHRF European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines on the use of HFNO in acute respiratory failure with the following conditional recommendations: Use HFNO over COT in adults with AHRF Use HFNO over NIV in patients with AHRF Use HFNO over COT when short breaks of NIV are needed due to feeding, speaking, relief from mask pressure, etc. Use either COT or HFNO in post-operative patients at low risk of respiratory complications Use either HFNO or NIV in post-operative patients at high risk of respiratory complications Use HFNO over COT in nonsurgical patients after extubation at low or moderate risk of extubation failure Use NIV over HFNO after extubation for patients with no contraindications to NIV and at high risk of extubation failure European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) European Respiratory Society/Amerian Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) joint guidelines on the use of noninvasive ventilation in ARF are summarized below. Bilevel noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) may be considered in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with an acute exacerbation in the following three clinical settings : To prevent acute respiratory acidosis (ie, when the arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaCO2] is normal or elevated but pH is normal) To prevent endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with mild-to-moderate acidosis and respiratory distress, with the aim of preventing deterioration to a point when invasive ventilation would be considered As an alternative to invasive ventilation in patients with severe acidosis and more severe respiratory distress Bilevel NIV also may be used as the only method for providing ventilatory support in patients who are not candidates for or decline invasive mechanical ventilation. Bilevel NIV is recommended as follows: Patients with ARF leading to acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis (pH ≤7.35) due to COPD exacerbation Patients considered to require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, unless the patient is immediately deteriorating Either bilevel NIV or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is recommended for patients with ARF due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema. CPAP or bilevel NIV is suggested for patients with ARF due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema in the prehospital setting. Early NIV is suggested for immunocompromised patients with ARF. NIV use is suggested as follows For patients with postoperative ARF Can be offered to dyspneic patients for palliation in the setting of terminal cancer or other terminal conditions For the prevention of post extubation respiratory failure in high-risk patients; not suggested to prevent post extubation respiratory failure in non–high-risk patients To facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure GENOMIC DATA OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE Surfactant Protein B (SP-B) Deficiency: Mutations in the SFTPB gene, such as the 121ins2 mutation, cause hereditary surfactant protein B deficiency leading to severe neonatal respiratory distress and chronic respiratory failure. These loss-of-function mutations impair surfactant production, essential for lung function, resulting in progressive respiratory failure in infants. Hereditary Myopathy with Early Respiratory Failure (HMERF): Caused by mutations in the TTN gene (titin), this autosomal dominant disorder affects skeletal muscles including respiratory muscles, leading to early-onset respiratory failure. Some mutations cause milder or later-onset symptoms, but homozygous mutations can cause severe respiratory muscle weakness and chronic respiratory failure. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Genetics: COPD, a common cause of chronic respiratory failure, has a genetic predisposition. The most well-known genetic risk factor is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (mutations in SERPINA1), which leads to early-onset emphysema and respiratory failure. Other candidate genes (e.g., CHRNA3/5, HHIP, FAM13A) have been implicated in susceptibility and progression of COPD, though data are complex and sometimes conflicting. Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer with COPD: Studies of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with coexisting COPD show distinct mutation profiles, including genes like EGFR, TP53, KRAS, and others (e.g., LRP1B, MLH1), which may correlate with more severe lung disease and respiratory failure. Other Genetic Mutations Linked to Chronic Lung Disease: Rare mutations in genes such as DNAL1 have been identified in indigenous populations causing chronic lung disease with respiratory failure PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q1. What are my treatment options? A. Oxygen therapy: Supplemental oxygen delivered via nasal cannula or mask to increase blood oxygen levels and reduce shortness of breath. It may be used continuously or during sleep and exercise. Inhaled medications: Bronchodilators and other inhaled drugs help open airways and improve lung function. Oral medications: Depending on the underlying cause, medications may prevent worsening lung function or treat infections and inflammation. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV): Devices like CPAP or BiPAP provide positive airway pressure to keep airways open, often used during sleep. Mechanical ventilation: In severe cases, a ventilator may assist or fully support breathing, sometimes via a tracheostomy. Tracheostomy: Surgical opening in the neck to place a breathing tube for long-term ventilation support if needed. Respiratory rehabilitation: Exercises and education to improve breathing endurance and muscle strength. Fluid management: Proper hydration supports circulation without causing lung fluid overload. Q2. What caused this? A. Chronic respiratory failure results from long-standing lung or respiratory muscle diseases that impair oxygenation and/or carbon dioxide removal. Common causes include: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Interstitial lung diseases (pulmonary fibrosis) Neuromuscular disorders affecting breathing muscles Chest wall deformities Severe obesity with hypoventilation Advanced heart or lung disease Q3. How do I take my medications? A. Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions carefully for each medication. Inhaled medications are typically administered via inhalers or nebulizers; use proper technique to ensure effective delivery. Oral medications should be taken with or without food as directed, at prescribed times. Never stop or change doses without consulting your provider. Q4. How do I use this device? Can you demonstrate? A. Devices like inhalers, nebulizers, CPAP, or BiPAP machines require specific techniques. Your healthcare provider or respiratory therapist can demonstrate proper use, including: How to assemble and clean the device How to position the mask or mouthpiece How to breathe during treatment for maximum benefit Ask for a hands-on demonstration and practice under supervision to ensure you are comfortable using the device. Q5. When can I expect to feel better? A. Improvement depends on the underlying cause and severity. Oxygen therapy and ventilation support can relieve symptoms quickly, but chronic lung conditions often require ongoing management. Pulmonary rehabilitation may improve exercise tolerance and quality of life over weeks to months. Some patients experience symptom stabilization rather than full recovery. Q6. When should I follow up with you? A. Regular follow-up visits are essential, often every 3 to 6 months or as advised. Contact your provider sooner if you notice worsening symptoms such as increased breathlessness, cough, sputum changes, or fatigue. Follow-up includes monitoring lung function, oxygen needs, and medication effectiveness DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE Doctor: Hello, I want to discuss your recent diagnosis of chronic respiratory failure. How have you been feeling lately? Patient: I’ve been feeling more short of breath, especially when I walk or do simple activities. Sometimes I feel very tired. Doctor: That’s understandable. Chronic respiratory failure means your lungs aren’t able to get enough oxygen into your blood or remove carbon dioxide efficiently over a long period. It often results from underlying lung or muscle problems. Patient: What caused this condition in my case? Doctor: In your situation, it’s mainly due to your chronic lung disease, which has gradually impaired your lung function. Other causes can include neuromuscular weakness or chest wall problems, but your tests point toward lung-related causes. Patient: What treatments are available to help me? Doctor: We will focus on supporting your breathing and managing symptoms. This includes supplemental oxygen therapy to raise your oxygen levels, inhaled medications like bronchodilators to open your airways, and possibly non-invasive ventilation like CPAP or BiPAP to assist your breathing, especially at night. Pulmonary rehabilitation exercises can also improve your lung strength and endurance. Patient: How do I take my medications and use these devices? Doctor: I will show you how to use your inhalers and oxygen equipment properly. For devices like CPAP or BiPAP, a respiratory therapist will provide hands-on training to ensure you are comfortable and using them correctly. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully to get the best benefit. Patient: When can I expect to feel better? Doctor: Some symptoms like breathlessness can improve quickly with oxygen and ventilation support. However, chronic respiratory failure is a long-term condition, so ongoing management is needed. Pulmonary rehab and medication adherence can improve your quality of life over weeks to months. Patient: When should I come back for follow-up? Doctor: We’ll schedule regular visits every 3 to 6 months to monitor your lung function and adjust treatment as needed. If you notice worsening breathlessness, increased coughing, changes in sputum, or any new symptoms like confusion or chest pain, please seek medical attention promptly. Patient: Thank you, doctor. This helps me understand what to expect and how to manage my condition. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’re here to support you, so don’t hesitate to contact us with any concerns.

Inspiratory Wheeze (Stridor) Though stridor is a distinct high-pitched sound during inhalation, it is sometimes confused with inspiratory wheezing. Bronchospasm Describes the underlying mechanism causing wheezing—constriction of the bronchial muscles. Sibilant Wheeze A medical term emphasizing the high-pitched, musical quality of wheezing. Airway Obstruction Sounds A broader term that includes wheezing as a sign of narrowed airways. DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION Wheezing Wheezing is the shrill, coarse whistling or rattling sound your breath makes when your airway is partially blocked or narrowed. It’s usually most apparent when you breathe out (exhale). Sometimes, it can be a sign that you’re having breathing problems due to an underlying condition. But, other times, wheezing can be a reaction to dust in the air or because you have a cold. Many treatments are available for wheezing, depending on what’s causing it. Your healthcare provider may recommend seeing a pulmonologist or allergist if your symptoms persist or if wheezing is due to a chronic health condition like asthma. What does wheezing sound like? Some wheezes can only be heard with a stethoscope, but often, you can hear them with your own ears. Wheezing is more obvious when you breathe out but can also be heard when you breathe in. The tone of the wheeze can vary depending on which part of your respiratory system is blocked or narrowed. Narrowing in the upper respiratory system may make for a hoarser wheeze. Lower obstructions may have a more musical tone, like how a wind instrument like a clarinet might sound. Anyone — from infants to older adults — can develop wheezing. In adults, people who smoke and people with emphysema or heart failure are most prone to wheezing. Wheezing is also quite common in infants. Up to 25% to 30% of infants develop wheezing in their first year. This may happen because babies have smaller airways. Children under 2 are also more susceptible to wheezing because they tend to get viral upper respiratory infections. Adults and children with asthma and allergies may also be more likely to experience wheezing. causes of wheezing An obstruction (blockage) or narrowing of the small bronchial tubes in your chest usually causes wheezing. An obstruction in your larger airways or vocal cords can also cause it. The causes range from chronic but manageable conditions like asthma to serious conditions like heart failure. Many different things can cause wheezing, such as medical conditions, infections or viruses, and lifestyle factors. Lung issues Asthma: A chronic condition that causes spasms and swelling in your bronchial tubes. Exposure to airborne allergens such as pollen, mold or dust can trigger wheezing in asthma. Viral illnesses can also make asthma symptoms worse. Asthma is one of the most common causes of wheezing. Aspirating: Breathing a foreign object or substance into your lungs. Bronchitis: Inflammation of the lining inside your bronchial tubes. Bronchiolitis: A virus most common in young children that causes inflammation and irritation in their airways. Bronchiectasis: Damage to the large airways in your lungs. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Inflammation and damage of the lining of your bronchial tube, most commonly from smoking cigarettes. Cystic fibrosis (CF): A condition that causes thick mucus to clog your airways and make breathing difficult. Emphysema: A lung condition that makes you short of breath. Pneumonia: Lung inflammation caused by a virus or bacteria. Other viral infections can cause wheezing, especially in infants and toddlers. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): A seasonal lung infection that’s common in children. Vocal cord issues Vocal cord dysfunction VCD causes your vocal cords to close instead of open when you breathe in and out, making it harder to get air into or out of your lungs. Issues with your digestive tract GERD: Chronic acid reflux can relax the lower esophageal valve, causing wheezing. Allergies Allergies: Allergen triggers like dust mites, pollens, pets, mold spores and foods can cause wheezing. Anaphylaxis: A severe allergic reaction typically caused by food allergies or insect stings can make you wheeze. Heart conditions: Heart failure: Fluid in your lungs due to heart failure can make you wheeze. Lifestyle factors Smoking: Smoking tobacco increases your risk of developing COPD and emphysema and makes it harder to manage conditions like asthma. Medications: Certain medications (like aspirin) may contribute to wheezing. Sleep apnea: Sleep disorders can cause wheezing. Wheezing Risk Factors Wheezing in Infants Wheezing is common in infants. About 50% of children have a wheezing episode in their first year of life. Young children are more likely to wheeze because their airways are small, and they’re also more likely to get upper respiratory infections than adults are. When this happens, the infants’ small passages swell, and they often fill with mucus, which can cause wheezing and coughing. If your infant is wheezing, that doesn’t necessarily mean they have asthma. Even if it happens repeatedly, they may outgrow it when they’re older and not have asthma. Sometimes, doctors will wait until the child is 4 or 5 before confirming a diagnosis of asthma. Wheezing can also mean that an object is lodged in the airway and needs to be removed. This is a concern especially with young children who may have put an object in their mouth. If a child starts wheezing out of the blue, this may be the reason, Moss says. Diagnosing the Cause of Wheezing To diagnose the cause of your wheezing, your doctor will perform an exam. They will also ask you some questions, such as: How long have you been wheezing? Does it happen when you exercise? Do you wheeze all the time? Do you wheeze more during the day or at night? Does rest help control your wheezing? Do you wheeze when you breathe in, out, or both in and out? Do you smoke? Do certain foods seem to cause your wheezing? They’ll listen to your breathing and the sounds your lungs make. They might do certain tests, such as: X-rays to get a picture of your lungs Breathing tests to see how well your lungs are functioning A blood test to check your oxygen levels (too low levels could signal a lung problem) If your child is wheezing, their doctor might check to see if they’ve swallowed or inhaled something small. TREATMENT OF Wheezing Your treatment for wheezing depends on its underlying cause. If you go to the ER or see a healthcare provider, they may begin with oxygen therapy to help you breathe. If wheezing is severe or doesn’t improve with supplemental oxygen, you may need to be hospitalized until your breathing improves. What medicines can you take for wheezing? Most of the time, taking medication to treat the cause of the wheezing improves your symptoms. For example, using an inhaler for asthma or taking antibiotics for an infection usually helps. Asthma medications If asthma is causing you to wheeze, your healthcare provider will likely prescribe an inhaler to reduce inflammation and open your airways (a bronchodilator). Inhaled corticosteroids and pills such as montelukast (Singulair®) are anti-inflammatory medicines to treat asthma. Bronchitis medications If your provider determines bronchitis is causing your wheezing, they may prescribe a bronchodilator such as albuterol (Proair® HFA, Proventil® HFA, Ventolin® HFA) or an antibiotic to heal a bacterial infection. This should help you breathe better as you recover. Other causes of wheezing may require specific treatments like oxygen therapy. Your provider will prescribe a plan to treat the underlying cause of your condition and soothe symptoms to help you feel better faster. OTC (over the counter) treatments for wheezing There are many ways you can improve wheezing at home without a prescription. Some of those treatments include: Breathing exercises. Taking slow, deep breaths helps expand your lung capacity and relaxes your airways (diaphragmatic breathing). Deep breathing in a moist, humid environment (like a steam room) can also help. Drink hot herbal tea. The warmth and moisture of tea will help relax your bronchial tubes. Some studies show green tea has antibacterial properties, as well. Don’t smoke. Smoking irritates your lungs and inflames your airways. Take precautions to avoid secondhand smoke. Use an air purifier with a HEPA filter. High-quality filters help remove allergens in your home. Vaporize your air: Humidifiers or vaporizers moisten the air to help you breathe better. Stay away from known allergy triggers. Avoid things that trigger your allergies. When To Call the Doctor See your healthcare provider if your wheezing is new, if it keeps coming back or if any of the following symptoms accompany it: Shortness of breath or rapid breathing. Confusion or altered mental state. Chest tightness or chest pain. Swelling of your lips or tongue. A bluish tinge around your skin, mouth or nails. Your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam, listen to your lungs and breath and ask about your symptoms. Questions could include things like: When did the wheezing start? Is the wheezing getting worse or staying the same? Is the wheezing constant or all day, or does it come and go? Do certain factors make the wheezing worse, like exercise, lying down or being outside? Your provider may also order tests like: Pulse oximetry (pulse ox, a finger sensor to measure oxygen levels). Chest X-rays. Pulmonary function tests. Blood tests. Whatever the cause, there are things you can do to get relief. Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions on taking medication, choosing not to smoke (or quitting) and running a vaporizer or humidifier to moisten the air. Doing all these things will help you breathe easier. If your skin, mouth or nails are turning blue or you’re gasping for air, it’s a sign that your lungs don’t have enough air. This is a medical emergency and you should have a family member or friend take you to the nearest emergency room. If you’re alone, call 911 (or your emergency services number) and describe your breathing. If you suddenly start wheezing after a bee sting, after you take a new medication or eat a new food, that could indicate an allergic reaction, and you should seek medical attention right away. Breathing Exercises for Wheezing Breathing exercises can reduce your wheezing and help your lungs work more efficiently. “Breathing techniques can also help the airway relax — help to change how a person is breathing and moving air in their airway,” Moss says. Try these breathing techniques: Pursed-lip breathing. Breathe in through your nose. Breathe out for twice as long, with your lips pursed like you’re going to whistle. Breathing out through pursed lips increases the airway pressure and helps open your airways a bit, Moss says. Belly breathing or diaphragmatic breathing. Breathe in through your nose. Put your hands on your belly and pay attention to how it expands. Breathe out through your mouth for at least two to three times as long as you breathe in. If you’re wheezing, your chest may feel tight. When you focus on your belly or your diaphragm while breathing, it helps relax your chest, Moss says. Buteyko breathing method. Breathe in and out through your nose for a few minutes. After breathing out, plug your nose and hold your breath, inhaling when you feel the urge to breathe. Breathe in and out through your nose a few times and repeat. This helps normalize breathing patterns. Nasal breathing. Breathe in and out through your nose, relaxing your jaw and throat. Breathe slow and steady. This helps warm and humidify the air as you breathe it in. Other breathing methods used in yoga or meditation can be helpful, too, Moss says. With these techniques, you’re “focusing your breathing deeper in your core, down to your belly, so that you’re getting a much deeper breath and you’re not breathing as shallowly,” he says. Many breathing techniques are used in yoga and meditation, and they may help improve your breathing. They include: Alternate nostril breathing. While sitting up, use your right thumb to close your right nostril, and inhale deeply through your left nostril. Use your ring finger to close your left nostril, and breathe out through your right nostril. Then switch, breathing in through your right, and repeat the process. Bumblebee breath. While sitting, close your eyes and put your index fingers on your eyelids, thumbs in your ears, and rest of the fingers on your face. Take a deep breath through your nose, and as you breathe out, close the back of your throat to make a humming or buzzing sound. Differential Diagnoses for Wheezing Common Causes Asthma (most common cause of recurrent wheezing) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Acute Bronchitis Allergic reactions / Anaphylaxis Viral respiratory infections (e.g., bronchiolitis in infants) Foreign body aspiration (especially in children) Heart failure (cardiac asthma) Other Causes Bronchiectasis Upper airway obstruction (e.g., vocal cord dysfunction, tumors, tracheal stenosis) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) causing airway irritation Pulmonary edema Cystic fibrosis Interstitial lung diseases (rarely cause wheezing but possible) Tumors or masses compressing airways Inhalation injury or exposure to irritants Vocal cord dysfunction or paradoxical vocal fold motion Epidemiology of Wheezing (mainly related to asthma): The prevalence of current wheeze varies globally, ranging from about 5.6% in low- and middle-income countries (Asia and Africa) to 11.6% in high-income countries (Europe and North America). Wheezing is a common symptom of asthma, which affected an estimated 262 million people worldwide in 2019, causing approximately 455,000 deaths. Asthma and wheezing are more prevalent in children, with higher incidence in boys during childhood; however, adults tend to have higher morbidity and mortality from asthma. Severe asthma, often accompanied by persistent wheezing, affects a smaller proportion of patients—around 2-8% depending on the population studied. Risk factors influencing wheezing prevalence include family history of asthma, other allergic conditions (eczema, rhinitis), urban living, exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution, viral respiratory infections early in life, and obesity. Wheezing prevalence and asthma rates tend to be higher in high-income countries, likely due to lifestyle and environmental factors. In the US, asthma prevalence among young adults is around 8-9%, with wheezing being a common symptom among these patients GENOMIC DATA OF Wheezing Different wheezing phenotypes (e.g., virus-induced wheezing vs. atopic asthma) are associated with distinct genetic polymorphisms. For example, virus-induced wheezing is frequently linked to IL-8 gene polymorphisms, while atopic asthma and atopy are associated with Th2 cytokine genes such as CD14 and IL-13 on chromosome 5. The gene ADAM33 (on chromosome 20p13) is strongly linked to asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, contributing to airway remodeling and disease progression, which can manifest as wheezing. Filaggrin gene mutations (chromosome 1q21), which impair skin barrier function, are associated with atopic dermatitis and increase the risk of allergic sensitization and asthma with wheezing, especially in patients with atopic dermatitis. A significant genetic locus on chromosome 17q21 (including genes like ORMDL3 and GSDMB) is strongly associated with early-onset wheezing and childhood asthma. Children with risk variants in this region who experience early-life wheezing illnesses caused by human rhinovirus have a dramatically increased risk of developing asthma. Genetic susceptibility to wheezing and asthma is complex, involving multiple genes and gene-environment interactions. For example, the combination of genetic risk variants and early viral wheezing illnesses can synergistically increase asthma risk. Other genes implicated in wheezing and asthma include IL33, ANXA1, and genes involved in immune regulation and airway epithelial response to infections PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Wheezing Q. How can I stop wheezing immediately? A. If your wheezing is severe and making it difficult to breathe, you may need albuterol or oxygen treatment. If your wheezing is not severe, you can try breathing exercises, such as belly breathing, to help relax your airways. Q. Can GERD cause wheezing? A. Yes. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition that can cause wheezing. Q. How can I stop wheezing without inhalers? A. You may or may not need medication for your wheezing. Breathing exercises also may help you stop wheezing. Sometimes wheezing will go away on its own. “For example, someone who’s allergic to a cat and has asthma, and goes to a house where there\\'s a cat, may notice that they start wheezing right away and leave the house, breathe some fresh air, and feel improvement within minutes because they’ve removed that trigger,” Moss says. Q. Can wheezing be cured? A. Wheezing isn’t exactly a disease that can be cured, but it can be stopped. For example, if you’re wheezing because you have asthma, taking preventative medication daily can help stop your wheezing. “A lot of people wouldn’t necessarily call that being cured because they’re still taking medication preventatively. So, a lot of times we’ll describe it as wheezing or asthma that goes into remission, Doctor-patient conversation about wheezing Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today? Patient: Hi doctor, I’ve been having some trouble breathing lately. I noticed a whistling sound when I breathe out. Doctor: I see. That sound is called wheezing. Have you experienced wheezing before, or do you have any history of asthma or allergies? Patient: No, this is the first time. I also have a cough and feel a bit short of breath. Doctor: Okay, let me listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath and hold it for a moment. (Doctor listens with stethoscope) Doctor: I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, which suggests your airways are narrowed. This could be due to asthma, an infection, or allergies. Have you had any recent colds or exposure to irritants like smoke? Patient: I had a cold last week, and I live with someone who smokes. Doctor: That could be contributing. I’m going to prescribe an inhaler that will help open your airways and reduce inflammation. It’s important to use it exactly as directed. Also, try to avoid smoke and other triggers. Patient: How soon will I feel better? Doctor: Many patients notice improvement within a few days of starting treatment. If your symptoms worsen or you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, or high fever, please come back immediately. Patient: Should I come back for a follow-up? Doctor: Yes, I’d like to see you in about two to three weeks to check your progress and adjust treatment if needed. Patient: Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You’re welcome. Don’t hesitate to call if you have questions or concerns before your appointment.

A chronic cough is more than just annoying. It can interrupt your sleep and leave you feeling very tired. Severe cases of chronic cough can cause vomiting and lightheadedness and even break a rib. The most common causes are tobacco use and asthma. Other common causes include fluid that drips from the nose down the back of the throat, called postnasal drip, and the backward flow of stomach acid into the tube that connects the throat to the stomach, called acid reflux. Fortunately, chronic cough usually goes away once the underlying issue is treated. Causes OF CHRONIC COUGH A cough that happens once in a while is common. It helps clear irritants and mucus from your lungs and prevents infection. But a cough that lasts for weeks is usually due to a health concern. Many times, more than one health concern causes the cough. Most cases of chronic cough are due to these causes, which can occur alone or together: Postnasal drip. When your nose or sinuses produce extra mucus, it can drip down the back of your throat and cause you to cough. This condition also is called upper airway cough syndrome. Asthma. An asthma-related cough may come and go with the seasons. It may appear after an upper respiratory tract infection. Or it can get worse when you\\'re exposed to cold air or certain chemicals or fragrances. In one type of asthma known as cough-variant asthma, a cough is the main symptom. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. In this common condition, also called GERD, stomach acid flows back into the tube that connects your stomach and throat. This tube is also known as your esophagus. The constant irritation can lead to chronic coughing. Then the coughing can make GERD worse, creating a vicious cycle. Infections. A cough can last long after other symptoms of pneumonia, flu, a cold or another infection of the upper respiratory tract have gone away. A common cause of a chronic cough in adults — but one that often isn\\'t recognized — is whooping cough, also known as pertussis. Chronic cough also can occur with fungal infections of the lung, as well as tuberculosis infection, also called TB, or lung infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria, also called NTM. NTM is found in soil, water and dust. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Also called COPD, this is a lifelong inflammatory lung disease that limits airflow from the lungs. COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic bronchitis can cause a cough that brings up colored sputum. Emphysema causes shortness of breath and damages the air sacs in the lungs, also known as alveoli. Most people with COPD are current or former smokers. Blood pressure drugs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, also called ACE inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed for high blood pressure and heart failure, are known to cause chronic cough in some people. Less commonly, chronic cough may be caused by: Aspiration — when food or other items are swallowed or inhaled and go into the lungs. Bronchiectasis — widened and damaged airways that slowly lose the ability to clear out mucus. Bronchiolitis — an infection that causes swelling, irritation and buildup of mucus in the small airways of the lung. Cystic fibrosis — a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, digestive system and other organs. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis — gradual damage and scarring of the lungs due to a cause that isn\\'t known. Lung cancer — cancer that starts in the lungs, including non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Non asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis — when airways are inflamed but asthma is not the cause. Sarcoidosis — groups of inflamed cells that form lumps or nodules in different parts of the body but most often in the lungs. Risk factors OF CHRONIC COUGH Being a current or former smoker is one of the leading risk factors for chronic cough. Exposure to a lot of secondhand smoke also can lead to coughing and lung damage. Symptoms A chronic cough can occur with other symptoms, including: A runny or stuffy nose. A feeling of liquid running down the back of your throat, also known as postnasal drip. Clearing your throat a lot. Sore throat. Hoarseness. Wheezing and shortness of breath. Heartburn or a sour taste in your mouth. In rare cases, coughing up blood. When to see a doctor See your healthcare professional if you have a cough that lasts for weeks, especially one that brings up sputum or blood, disturbs your sleep, or affects school or work. Diagnosis OF CHRONIC COUGH Your healthcare professional asks about your medical history and does a physical exam. A thorough medical history and physical exam can give important clues about a chronic cough. Your health professional also may order tests to look for the cause of your chronic cough. But many health professionals start treatment for one of the common causes of chronic cough rather than ordering expensive tests. If the treatment doesn\\'t work, you may be tested for less common causes. Imaging tests X-rays. Although a routine chest X-ray won\\'t reveal the most common reasons for a cough — postnasal drip, acid reflux, tobacco use or asthma — it may be used to check for lung cancer, pneumonia and other lung diseases. An X-ray of your sinuses may reveal evidence of a sinus infection. Computerized tomography scans. These scans also are called CT scans. They may be used to check your lungs for conditions that may produce chronic cough or your sinus cavities for pockets of infection. Lung function tests These simple, noninvasive tests, such as spirometry, are used to diagnose asthma and COPD. They measure how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can exhale. Your healthcare professional may request an asthma challenge test. This test checks how well you can breathe before and after inhaling the drug methacholine (Provocholine). Lab tests If the mucus that you cough up is colored, your healthcare professional may want to test a sample of it for bacteria. Scope tests If your healthcare professional can\\'t find the cause of your cough, special scope tests may be used to look for possible causes. These tests may include: Bronchoscopy. A bronchoscope is a thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera attached to it. Your health professional can look at your lungs and air passages. A biopsy also can be taken from the inside lining of your airway, also known as the mucosa, to look for anything unusual. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue for testing in a lab. Rhinoscopy. Using a fiberoptic scope, also known as a rhinoscope, your health professional can view your nasal passageways, sinuses and upper airway. Children A chest X-ray and spirometry, at a minimum, are usually ordered to find the cause of a chronic cough in children. Treatment OF CHRONIC COUGH Finding out what\\'s causing a chronic cough is very important to effective treatment. In many cases, more than one underlying condition may be causing your chronic cough. If you smoke, your healthcare professional likely will talk with you about your readiness to quit and give you advice on how to achieve this goal. If you\\'re taking an ACE inhibitor medicine, your health professional may switch you to another medicine that doesn\\'t have cough as a side effect. Medicines used to treat chronic cough may include: Antihistamines, corticosteroids and decongestants. These medicines are standard treatment for allergies and postnasal drip. Inhaled asthma medicines. The most effective treatments for asthma-related cough are corticosteroids and bronchodilators. They reduce inflammation and open up your airways. Antibiotics. If a bacterial, fungal or mycobacterial infection is causing your chronic cough, your healthcare professional may prescribe antibiotic medicines for the infection. Acid blockers. When lifestyle changes don\\'t take care of acid reflux, you may be treated with medicines that block acid production. Some people need surgery to resolve the problem. Medicine to reduce coughing Your healthcare professional works to find the cause of your cough and the best treatment for you. During that time, your healthcare professional also may prescribe a medicine to reduce coughing, called a cough suppressant. Cough suppressants are not recommended for children. Cough and cold medicines available without a prescription treat the symptoms of coughs and colds — not the underlying disease. Research suggests that these medicines don\\'t work any better than no medicine at all. These medicines are not recommended for children because of potentially serious side effects, including fatal overdoses in children younger than 2 years old. Don\\'t use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines, except for fever reducers and pain relievers, to treat coughs and colds in children younger than 6 years old. Also, avoid use of these medicines for children younger than 12 years old. Check with your healthcare professional for guidance. Treatment options for chronic cough, including common drugs and their side effects 1. Cough Suppressants (Antitussives) Purpose: Reduce the cough reflex, mainly for dry, irritating coughs. Common drugs: Dextromethorphan (found in Robitussin DM, Delsym) Codeine (prescription only) Benzonatate (Tessalon) Side effects: Drowsiness, dizziness Nausea Potential for dependence (especially codeine) Not recommended for children under 6 years due to risk of serious side effects. 2. Expectorants Purpose: Loosen mucus in the airways to help clear productive coughs. Common drugs: Guaifenesin (Mucinex) Side effects: Nausea, vomiting Dizziness Rare allergic reactions. 3. Mucolytics Purpose: Thin mucus to make it easier to cough up. Common drugs: Bromhexine (not widely available in all countries) Side effects: Gastrointestinal discomfort Rare allergic reactions. 4. Inhaled Bronchodilators and Corticosteroids Purpose: Reduce airway inflammation and open airways, especially if asthma or COPD is the cause. Common drugs: Albuterol (bronchodilator) Fluticasone or Budesonide (inhaled steroids) Side effects: Tremors, nervousness (bronchodilators) Oral thrush, hoarseness (inhaled steroids) Long-term steroid use may have systemic effects. 5. Acid-Reducing Medications (for GERD-related cough) Purpose: Reduce stomach acid to prevent reflux-induced cough. Common drugs: Proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) H2 receptor blockers (e.g., ranitidine) Side effects: Headache, diarrhea Long-term use may increase risk of fractures or infections. 6. Antihistamines and Decongestants (for postnasal drip) Purpose: Reduce nasal congestion and allergic inflammation causing cough. Common drugs: Diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine (antihistamines) Pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline (decongestants) Side effects: Drowsiness (antihistamines) Increased heart rate, insomnia (decongestants) Not recommended for people with hypertension or certain heart conditions. 7. Antibiotics Purpose: Treat bacterial infections causing chronic cough (e.g., pneumonia, whooping cough). Side effects: Gastrointestinal upset Allergic reactions Antibiotic resistance with misuse. Lifestyle and home remedies OF CHRONIC COUGH Follow the plan your healthcare professional gives you for treating the cause of your cough. In the meantime, you can try these tips to ease your cough: Drink fluids. Liquid helps thin the mucus in your throat. Warm liquids, such as broth, tea or juice, can soothe your throat. Suck on cough drops or hard candies. They may ease a dry cough and soothe an irritated throat. Consider taking honey. A teaspoon of honey may help loosen a cough. Don\\'t give honey to children younger than 1 year old. Honey can contain bacteria harmful to infants. Moisturize the air. Use a cool-mist humidifier or take a steamy shower. Avoid tobacco smoke. Smoking or breathing secondhand smoke irritates your lungs and can worsen coughs. If you smoke, talk with your healthcare professional about programs and products that can help you quit. What happens if chronic cough goes untreated? Chronic coughing can keep you up at night and rob you of precious sleep (insomnia). The effects can snowball into fatigue and stress that impact every part of your life. The frequent coughing can make you self-conscious — so much so that you avoid being around others. In severe cases of chronic cough, you may have related medical issues like: Bleeding in your eye Broken ribs Dizziness Headaches Hernia Loss of bladder control Muscle pain in your coughing muscles Prevention OF CHRONIC COUGH You can’t always prevent chronic cough. But you can do things to reduce your risk. You can: Quit smoking. If you don’t smoke, don’t start. Protect yourself from germs that can make you sick. This may mean staying up to date on flu shots, masking or washing your hands often. There are lots of ways to protect yourself. See your primary care provider and discuss the issue with them. They’ll help you decide if you need testing or treatment based on your symptoms. Complications OF CHRONIC COUGH Having a cough that doesn\\'t stop can be very tiring. Coughing can cause various concerns, including: Sleep disruption. Headache. Dizziness. Vomiting. Sweating a lot. Unintended bladder loss, also known as urinary incontinence. Broken ribs. Passing out, also known as syncope. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC COUGH The differential diagnosis of chronic cough includes the following conditions: Bronchiolitis Bronchogenic carcinoma Chronic aspiration Congestive heart failure Foreign body aspiration Neuromuscular disorders Psychogenic cough EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CHRONIC COUGH Chronic cough has a global prevalence of 3% to 18% in the general adult population and is affected by several factors, such as smoking and age Eighteen percent of adults in the United States who smoke have chronic coughs. The prevalence is variable, however, based on the location of the population studied. Chronic cough was significantly more frequent in Europe and America than in Asia and Africa. However, the geographic variation is not genetic or ethnically related. The regional variation in chronic cough prevalence may be attributed to environmental factors, particularly urbanization in Western countries, which can lead to increased inhalational exposure to irritants. The findings from the KNHANES 2010–2012 study indicate that the prevalence of chronic cough increases significantly with age. The odds ratio (OR) of 2.20 and 95% confidence interval of 1.53 to 3.16 suggests a substantial increase in the likelihood of chronic cough among individuals 65 or older compared to those aged 18 to 39. This finding aligns with the general trend observed in various studies, where chronic cough becomes more prevalent in older age groups. The cumulative effects of environmental exposures over time may also play a role. One study by Dicpinigaitis et al assessed ethnic and sex differences in cough reflex sensitivity and found no significant ethnic differences in cough reflex sensitivity among 3 distinct ethnic groups: White, Indian, and Chinese. This suggests that the variation in the prevalence of chronic cough among different races may not be directly attributed to differences in cough reflex sensitivity. In addition to age and smoking, the factors that contribute to the increased prevalence of chronic cough include obesity, atopy, asthma, COPD, GERD, ACE inhibitors, and sleep-disordered breathing. Other factors, such as air pollution and air quality, do not significantly affect the prevalence of chronic cough, and study results have been inconclusive, except for metal exposure. PROGNOSIS OF CHRONIC COUGH Cough is a distinct and independent factor that can serve as an indicator of disease progression. The prognostic implications of cough in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are significant. A study of 242 IPF patients revealed that the presence of cough was an independent predictor of disease progression, regardless of the severity of the disease. Furthermore, cough was more prevalent in patients with advanced pulmonary fibrosis. Nevertheless, it is crucial to differentiate whether the cough results from the underlying inflammation or fibrosis or is due to a comorbidity when assessing cough in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). A recent study revealed that many individuals diagnosed with chronic cough continued to experience persistent coughing for at least 5 years. This finding was somewhat more optimistic than a prior study on the same subject, which reported that 60% of patients experienced worsening or unchanged cough symptoms at a 7-year follow-up. The disparity in the results can be attributed to differences in the patient populations studied. The earlier investigation was limited to patients with unexplained chronic cough, whereas the recent study enrolled individuals with various cough-related disorders and idiopathic cough. Thus, the latter study may provide a more accurate representation of the general chronic cough patient population. Notably, the prevalence of autoimmune diseases was high in the more recent group, a characteristic commonly observed in patients with idiopathic chronic cough. Among the study participants, most asthma and chronic rhinitis patients were effectively managed with local corticosteroid preparations or antihistamines. However, most reflux disease patients did not receive treatment with proton pump inhibitors, an ineffective regimen for reflux-associated cough. Consequently, the study population likely reflects the real-life medication regimens of patients. The study further identified obesity as a significant predictor of continued cough-related quality of life impairment. Indeed, subjects who met the current criteria for obesity were found to be at a higher risk for ongoing cough-related distress. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON CHRONIC COUGH Q1. How long have you had the cough? A. A cough lasting more than 8 weeks is considered chronic and warrants further evaluation. Q2. Is the cough dry or productive? A.

DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON CHRONIC COUGH Doctor: Hello, I understand you’ve been experiencing a cough that’s lasted for quite some time. Can you tell me how long you’ve had this cough? Patient: It’s been going on for about three months now. It just won’t go away. Doctor: Thank you. Is your cough dry, or do you bring up any mucus? Patient: It’s mostly dry, but sometimes I do cough up a little phlegm. Doctor: Have you noticed any other symptoms like shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, or coughing up blood? Patient: No blood, but I do feel a bit short of breath sometimes, especially when I’m active. Doctor: Do you have any history of asthma, allergies, or acid reflux? Also, are you currently taking any medications, like blood pressure medicines? Patient: I have mild seasonal allergies, and I started an ACE inhibitor for my blood pressure about six months ago. Doctor: That’s helpful to know. ACE inhibitors can sometimes cause a persistent dry cough. Have you noticed if the cough started after you began that medication? Patient: Yes, it started a couple of months after I began the medication. Doctor: That could be the cause. We can consider stopping or switching your blood pressure medicine to see if your cough improves. In the meantime, I’d like to examine your chest and listen to your lungs. (Doctor performs examination) Doctor: Your lungs sound clear, which is a good sign. I’d also like to order a chest X-ray and possibly lung function tests to rule out other causes. Patient: What else could be causing this cough? Doctor: Common causes include postnasal drip from allergies, asthma, or acid reflux. Sometimes, infections or other lung conditions can cause a chronic cough. We’ll investigate and treat accordingly. Patient: When should I come back to see you? Doctor: Let’s schedule a follow-up in about four weeks to review your test results and see how you’re doing after any medication changes. If your cough worsens, you develop fever, or start coughing up blood, please come in sooner. Patient: Thank you, doctor. That helps me understand what’s going on. Doctor: You’re welcome. Feel free to call if you have any questions before your appointment.

DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Congenital lung abnormalities Congenital lung abnormalities are lung problems from birth. They happen when tissues in the lungs or airways haven’t developed properly during pregnancy. What causes them isn’t known. There are several different types of congenital lung abnormality. For example, there could be a problem with: the lungs the airways the blood supply to the lungs or the airways. The most common type of congenital lung abnormality is congenital pulmonary airway malformations or CPAM. CPAM affects the lungs and airways. congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM) Congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM) are abnormal areas of tissue (lesions) on the lung. They happen when the airway and surrounding lung tissue does not develop properly. Congenital = something the baby is born with Pulmonary = affects the lungs CPAM are the most common type of congenital lung abnormality. Most babies with CPAM can be delivered normally and will not have any obvious symptoms after they are born. CPAM are usually detected before your baby is born, at the 20-week prenatal scan. They often get larger during the last trimester of pregnancy, before shrinking again before birth. There are different types of CPAM. A single CPAM can be ‘hybrid’, meaning having multiple different tissues in it. Doctors will not know for certain exactly which type of CPAM your baby is affected by unless the decision is to remove it by an operation after birth. At some time after birth (timing will vary between different hospitals), your child will have a scan to find out more about the CPAM. A chest CT scan with an injection of dye will show the abnormality. A type of dye called contrast is injected to help the blood vessels show up on the scan. The injection will only last a few seconds, and the scan itself is painless. Different types of CPAM that may show up on a chest CT scan include: bronchogenic cysts: this is when pockets of tissue called cysts develop on the bronchial tree (the system of airways called bronchi and bronchioles) bronchial atresia (absent bronchus): this is when one or more airways at the very end of the bronchial tree (peripheral bronchi) are missing and the airway beyond the blockage swells by ongoing production of lung fluid bronchopulmonary sequestration: this is when a mass of abnormal lung tissue develops next to the lung, or inside one lung. It’s usually solid rather than air filled and doesn’t function or connect with the rest of the breathing system congenital cystic adenomatous malformation (CCAM): this is when pockets of tissue called cysts develop in one or more sections (lobes) of the lung congenital lobar overinflation (CLO): this is when one of the lobes of the lung gets overinflated. This squashes and moves the lung tissues next to it and causes breathing difficulties. It’s sometimes known as congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) or congenital large hyperlucent lobe (CLHL). foregut duplication cyst: this is when during pregnancy, some parts of the unborn baby’s lung develop abnormally. At first, in the very early stages of development, the lung bud (which goes on to form the lungs) grows out of what will become the gut. This means that some lung cystic abnormalities look like parts of the intestine when removed and examined under a microscope. CPAM or cancer A rare cancer of young children known as pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) can sometimes look like a CPAM. If a CPAM has been diagnosed at your prenatal scan, it’s very unlikely to be PPB. Once your baby is born, if doctors find a CPAM with a pneumothorax (collapsed lung), doctors will consider this very rare diagnosis and carry out tests to rule out or confirm PPB. Other cancers can happen in CPAMs, but these are very rare, and you will need to discuss this with your pediatrician. CPAM and other congenital lung abnormalities Congenital lung abnormalities are rare. Researchers estimate they may affect about one in every 10,000 babies born. There are many different types of congenital lung abnormality. Each type is very rare. We don’t have accurate figures for how common each abnormality is, but CPAM is the most common. causes congenital lung abnormalities It’s not known what causes congenital lung problems. Some congenital lung abnormalities happen together with other congenital abnormalities, such as heart problems. Researchers are working to understand more about how congenital lung abnormalities happen. In some cases, they have identified faulty genes and processes that cause the lungs to develop abnormally. symptoms of congenital lung abnormalities Children’s symptoms will vary depending on the condition. Congenital lung abnormalities may be found before birth, in a newborn baby or later in life. Signs before birth In some babies, congenital lung abnormalities may be picked up on antenatal scans before they are born. This is usually the case with CPAM. Signs in new-born babies Most babies with CPAM have no obvious signs of chest problems. Some babies with other congenital lung abnormalities will have breathing problems as soon as they are born. Symptoms can include: noisy breathing, known as stridor a blue colour on your skin, lips, tongue, or gums (cyanosis). Sometimes a baby may have significant breathing difficulties and may need help with their breathing. This might include ventilation (a breathing machine) or taking oxygen through a face mask or tubes in their nose. Signs in older children and adults Most children with CPAM will not experience symptoms. In older children and adults, symptoms of congenital lung abnormalities can include: infections that keep coming back in the affected area of the lung bronchiectasis asthma-like symptoms (coughing, wheezing, breathlessness) that do not respond to asthma treatment. congenital lung abnormalities diagnosed Lung problems can sometimes show up on an ultrasound scan when the baby is still in the womb. This is usually the case with CPAM. For children, doctors might use a bronchoscopy (a camera test to look inside the airways) if they think your child may have an upper airway abnormality. Treatment OF Congenital lung abnormalities Babies and children with CPAM and other congenital lung abnormalities will usually go to specialist centers to investigate and manage their condition. If the abnormality is found on an antenatal scan, the pregnancy will be monitored, and arrangements may be made to deliver the baby in a specialist center. Treatment before birth (antenatal treatment) Very rarely babies need treatment before they’re born - this is called antenatal treatment. For example, in unborn babies with a bronchopulmonary sequestration, doctors might block the abnormal vessels while they are still in the womb. Treatment after birth Treatment for CPAM after your child is born will depend on their condition and if they have symptoms. A few babies with congenital lung abnormalities may need emergency surgery when they are born. Others may have an operation because of features shown on a CT scan or following any complications that may develop after they’re born. If your child has symptoms, the CPAM should be removed surgically. As your child grows up, if they do not have any symptoms, they may not need immediate treatment and will have regular check-ups to monitor their condition. Some children may be offered surgery before any symptoms show to remove the CPAM. This may be to try and reduce infections that keep coming back. You should be involved in making the decision with the health care professional. Policies on surgery before any symptoms show differ between treatment centers, and there is not enough evidence to help decide which CPAMs are at risk of complications. You should ask your pediatrician to explain the risks and benefits of surgery. Other than surgery, your child will need treatment for any complications that happen related to their congenital lung abnormality. For example, they’ll need antibiotics if there is an infection in the affected area. However, once a CPAM gets infected, it likely needs to be removed surgically to stop repeat infections. Long-term outlook and complications of CPAM Some people live with congenital lung abnormalities for a long time without having any symptoms at all. Their condition might be discovered by chance when they have a chest X-ray (or especially in adults, a CT scan) for a different reason. The long-term outlook and any long-term complications for CPAM and other congenital lung abnormalities will depend on the type of condition your child has. Generally, when CPAM is diagnosed prenatally (before your child is born), the long-term outlook is good. However, a few types of CPAM (around 5%) can develop complications and it is not known which. You should speak to your doctor or nurse for advice specific to your child’s condition. The 5 Stocker classifications of CCAM (CPAM) are as follows: Type 0: the rarest form, 1-3% of cases, arises from the trachea or bronchus, presentation is severe and usually lethal, birth presentation, cysts of 0.5 cm with ciliated pseudostratified epithelial lining and goblet cells, bronchiolar cartilage present, all lobes involved. Type I: 50–70% of cases, arising from the distal bronchus or proximal bronchiole, a small number of large echolucent cysts measuring 3–10 cm or a single dominant, cyst walls are thin and lined with a ciliated pseudostratified epithelium with bronchiolar differentiation, mucinous cells in 33% and cartilage in 10% of cases, only one lobe involved. Type II: 15–30% of cases, arise from terminal bronchioles, first month of life presentation, multiple spaced cysts of 0.5-2.5 cm (sponge-like appearance) as well as solid area, ciliated cuboidal or columnar epithelial lining, absence of mucinous cells and cartilage, highest incidence of associated anomalies at up to 60%, involvement of usually only one lobe. Type III: 5–10% of cases, in uterus or birth respiratory distress, bulky firm mass with adenomatoid appearance and cysts of 1.5 cm, ciliated cuboidal epithelial lining, absence of mucous cells and cartilage, involvement of usually only one lobe or one lung, associated with a poorer prognosis, microcystic. Type IV: 5–15% of cases, newborn respiratory distress, pneumothorax, pneumonia or incidental finding, peripheral cysts with acinar-alveolar epithelial differentiation, cysts as large as 10 cm and associated with malignancy, specifically pleuropulmonary blastoma, alveolar in origin, antenatally classified as microcystic (< 5 mm). CPAM Differential Diagnosis List Bronchopulmonary Sequestration (BPS) Non-functioning lung tissue with systemic arterial supply (from aorta), no connection to bronchial tree; may coexist as hybrid lesions with CPAM features. Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) Herniation of abdominal contents (bowel loops) into the thoracic cavity; identified by presence of bowel in chest on imaging. Congenital Lobar Emphysema (CLE) (Congenital Lobar Overinflation) Overinflation of a lung lobe causing hyperlucency without cystic or solid masses. Bronchogenic Cyst Usually unilocular, fluid-filled cysts with no communication to the bronchial tree; lined by respiratory epithelium and containing cartilage. Localized Congenital Cystic Bronchiectasis Cystic dilation of bronchi due to mucus retention or infection; may mimic CPAM on imaging. Pulmonary Hypoplasia Underdevelopment of lung tissue, often associated with other anomalies. Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) Rare malignant cystic lung tumor in children; may resemble CPAM but has malignant histology. Other Cystic Lung Lesions Cystic teratoma Enteric duplication cyst Pulmonary cystic lymphangioma EPIDEMIOLOGY OF Congenital lung abnormalities Though uncommon overall, about 95% of congenital cystic lung disease is accounted for by congenital pulmonary airway malformation. The incidence of CPAM is reported as 1 in 10000 to 1 in 35000 births. There have been some studies that show male predominance in lesions that present in early infancy. Overall, these malformations occur sporadically with no genetic predisposition (except Type 4), and no association with maternal factors GENOMIC DATA OF Congenital lung abnormalities Oligogenic and Heterogeneous Mutations: CPAM appears to be caused by mutations in multiple genes involved in lung development and cancer pathways. Studies found an excess of damaging variants in genes linked to lung carcinoma and developmental lung abnormalities, suggesting CPAM is an oligogenic disorder with variable phenotypes depending on gene interactions. Cancer-Associated Genes: Several CPAM patients carry damaging mutations in genes commonly mutated in lung adenocarcinomas and other cancers, such as KRAS, TP53, FGFR2, and LRP2. This genetic overlap may explain the reported association between CPAM and later development of malignancies like mucinous adenocarcinoma or pleuropulmonary blastoma. Somatic KRAS Mutations: Somatic activating mutations in KRAS have been identified particularly in CPAM Type 1 lesions, primarily in mucinous and nonmucinous epithelial cells. These mutations may drive abnormal airway epithelial proliferation and are considered markers of potential malignant transformation. DICER1 and Related Syndromes: While DICER1 mutations are linked to pleuropulmonary blastoma (a rare lung tumor sometimes confused with CPAM), recent studies found no pathogenic DICER1 variants in many CPAM tissue samples, suggesting distinct genetic mechanisms. Developmental Pathways and Immune Response: Transcriptomic analyses show upregulation of genes involved in primary cilium development and ciliopathies, and downregulation of immune pathways (e.g., antigen presentation, interferon gamma response), indicating disrupted airway epithelial differentiation and suppressed innate immunity in CPAM tissue. Mosaic RASopathies Concept: CPAM may represent a form of mosaic RASopathy, where somatic mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway (including KRAS) cause localized developmental lung anomalies with potential for neoplastic progression PROGNOSIS OF Congenital lung abnormalities The overall prognosis for congenital pulmonary airway malformation, when diagnosed prenatally, is excellent. There have been several cases that report prenatal regression of the lesion. If fetal hydrops is present, the survival rate drops. Surgical resection has been shown to increase survival rates and has proved to be curative in the neonatal period. There have been studies, however, that show conservative management, in selected cases, to be equally effective. Out of the different types per the Stocker classification, Type 1 is shown to have the best prognosis. Type 2’s prognosis depends on the severity of the associated anomalies. Type 3 often has hypoplasia of an entire lobe leading to complications such as pulmonary hypertension. Type 4 has an excellent prognosis with surgical resection but does have a strong correlation with pleuropulmonary blastoma Doctor-patient conversation about Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM) Doctor: Hello, I’d like to talk with you about your baby’s lung condition called Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation, or CPAM. This is a rare lung abnormality that develops before birth. Parent: What exactly is CPAM? Is it serious? Doctor: CPAM is a benign mass or cystic lesion made up of abnormal lung tissue that doesn’t work properly. It usually affects one lobe of the lung. Many babies with CPAM do well, especially if the lesion is small, but some may have breathing difficulties or infections depending on the size and location of the lesion. Parent: What causes CPAM? Doctor: We don’t know the exact cause. It happens during lung development in the womb and is not inherited or related to anything the mother did during pregnancy. It occurs in about 1 in 25,000 pregnancies. Parent: How is CPAM diagnosed? Doctor: Often, CPAM is detected during routine prenatal ultrasounds. Sometimes we use fetal MRI to get more detail. After birth, we confirm the diagnosis with imaging like chest X-rays and CT scans. Parent: What treatments are available? Doctor: If the lesion is small and your baby has no symptoms, we may monitor closely. Surgery to remove the affected lung tissue is usually recommended when the baby is around 1 to 3 months old. Early surgery helps the remaining lung grow and reduces risks of infections or rare complications like cancer. Parent: What happens during surgery? Is it risky? Doctor: Surgery involves removing the affected lobe of the lung. It’s typically done through a minimally invasive approach and most babies stay in the hospital for 2 to 5 days afterward. The risks are low, and most babies recover well with normal lung function as they grow. Parent: Will my baby need long-term follow-up? Doctor: Most babies do well after surgery and only need follow-up for about a year to ensure normal lung growth. Some babies with larger or more complex lesions may need longer monitoring. We have specialized programs to support children with lung growth issues. Parent: What should I watch for after birth? Doctor: Watch for signs of breathing difficulty, persistent cough, or infections. If your baby has trouble feeding or seems unusually tired, please seek medical attention promptly. Parent: Thank you, doctor. This helps me understand what to expect. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’ll work closely with you to provide the best care for your baby. Please feel free to ask any questions at any time.

Acquired Tracheomalacia When tracheomalacia develops later due to injury, inflammation, or external compression. Tracheal Cartilage Softening Describes the underlying pathology of weakened tracheal cartilage. Dynamic Tracheal Collapse Refers to the airway collapse during breathing due to tracheal wall weakness. Tracheal Collapse Syndrome Emphasizes the functional consequence of the malacia. Airway Malacia A broader term that includes tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia (softening of the bronchi). Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) When both the trachea and bronchi are involved. DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Tracheomalacia Tracheomalacia (TRAY-kee-oh-muh-LAY-shia) is when you have weak or floppy cartilage in your trachea (windpipe). The walls of your windpipe can collapse or fall in, causing symptoms like high-pitched breathing. It can also trap mucus in your lungs, making it difficult to clear them out. In severe cases, tracheomalacia may be life-threatening, but it’s curable with treatment. Tracheomalacia usually affects newborns, but anyone can develop it. Babies born with the condition often develop symptoms when they’re 1 to 2 months old. Then, symptoms improve over the first three years of life. That’s because cartilage strengthens as your baby’s windpipe grows. But severe cases may need surgery. Types of Tracheomalacia(this condition) There are two types of tracheomalacia: Congenital tracheomalacia: “Congenital” means you’re born with the condition. It happens when a baby’s windpipe didn’t form properly during fetal development. Acquired tracheomalacia: “Acquired” means the condition developed after you were born. It happens when your windpipe breaks down or gets damaged. Injuries, surgeries or prolonged mechanical ventilation can cause this. Although it’s uncommon, acquired tracheomalacia can occur at any age. Some people with tracheomalacia also have weak bronchi (the tubes that run from your windpipe to your lungs). Healthcare providers call this condition tracheobronchomalacia. Congenital tracheomalacia is somewhat rare. Even so, it’s the most common birth defect affecting the windpipe. Approximately 1 in 2,100 children are born with the condition. Acquired tracheomalacia (which can occur at any age) is also very uncommon. causes OF tracheomalacia Congenital tracheomalacia happens when the cartilage in your baby’s windpipe doesn’t develop the way it should. The walls of their windpipe are floppy instead of rigid. Acquired tracheomalacia causes include: Chronic acid reflux (GERD). Damage from surgery or other medical procedures. Emphysema. Polychondritis (inflammation of the cartilage) in your windpipe. Tracheoesophageal fistula repair (fixing an abnormal connection between your esophagus and trachea). Tracheostomy, or long-term use of a breathing tube. Upper respiratory infections, like bronchitis. Tracheomalacia may be associated with other conditions like: Developmental delays. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Heart defects. Risk Factors OF Tracheomalacia Age: Tracheomalacia is more common in infants and young children, particularly those born prematurely. Gender: Some studies suggest a higher prevalence in males. Geographic Location: Exposure to environmental pollutants may vary by location, influencing the risk. Underlying Conditions: Individuals with chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may be at higher risk. symptoms of tracheomalacia The most common tracheomalacia symptom is high-pitched or noisy breathing (stridor). Other symptoms include: Breathing issues that get worse when feeding, crying or coughing. Choking. Chronic coughing. Cyanosis (a condition where your skin, lips or nails turn blue from a lack of oxygen). Difficulty swallowing. Hoarseness. Recurring (returning) airway infections like pneumonia or bronchitis. Shortness of breath. Wheezing or rattling sounds. Diagnosis and Tests OF Tracheomalacia A healthcare provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. They’ll also use laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy to look at your windpipe. To do this, they’ll guide a lighted scope with a camera down your throat. Your healthcare provider may need to run more tests to diagnose tracheomalacia, like: Airway fluoroscopy. Barium swallow (esophagram). Chest X-ray. CT (computed tomography) scan. Lung function tests. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Management and Treatment OF Tracheomalacia Healthcare providers can treat tracheomalacia with nonsurgical therapies, medications or surgery. What’s right for you depends on the extent of the condition. Nonsurgical therapies The following treatments help keep your airways open and your lungs clear: Breathing humidified air. Using a humidifier can thin out mucus so you can breathe comfortably. Chest physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you breathing exercises to clear mucus from your lungs. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Using a CPAP machine can keep your windpipe from collapsing too much during sleep. Medications FOR Tracheomalacia Healthcare providers use several different medications to treat tracheomalacia, including: Antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. Bronchodilators to relax the muscles that help you breathe. Corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Mucolytics to thin out mucus. Surgery Severe tracheomalacia cases may need surgery. Some options include: Aortopexy. A surgeon moves your aorta up and away from your airway and attaches it to your breastbone. This keeps your windpipe from collapsing. Stenting. This involves placing a stent (hollow tube) in your airway to keep it open. Tracheopexy. A surgeon connects part of your windpipe to a nearby structure (like your breastbone or a ligament at the top of your spine). This keeps your windpipe open and prevents collapse. complications of tracheomalacia Without treatment, tracheomalacia can cause: Airway obstruction. Aspiration pneumonia. Growth faltering. Upper respiratory infections that linger or come back often Outlook / Prognosis OF Tracheomalacia After treatment, most people with tracheomalacia go on to live healthy lives with no complications. Treatment isn’t always necessary. Congenital tracheomalacia usually improves on its own by age 3. As your baby’s tracheal cartilage grows stronger, their symptoms will likely improve. But in some cases, your baby may need medication and/or surgery. People with tracheomalacia need close monitoring if they develop respiratory infections. Even minor colds can cause complications. Your healthcare provider may recommend treatments or medications to manage your symptoms. Prevention OF Tracheomalacia There’s nothing you can do to reduce your risk for tracheomalacia. But you can manage it with the help of your healthcare provider. When should I see my healthcare provider? Schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider if your baby shows tracheomalacia symptoms. This includes things like frequent cough, noisy breathing or prolonged respiratory infections. Tracheomalacia in adults can cause exercise intolerance and frequent respiratory infections. Tell your provider if you notice these things. They can confirm the diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment. Diagnostic Considerations OF Tracheomalacia The differential diagnosis of tracheomalacia includes laryngomalacia, subglottic stenosis, congenital cysts, vocal cord paralysis, and hypocalcemic tetany. Complications include problems with acute airway obstruction and perioperative morbidity and mortality. According to a 2005 study by Boogaard, when pediatric pulmonologists diagnosed airway malacia (on the basis of symptoms, history, and lung function) prior to bronchoscopy, a correct diagnosis was made in 74% of the cases. However, in 52% of the diagnoses of airway malacia, the diagnosis was not suspected prior to bronchoscopy. Children with tracheomalacia present with atypical and variable clinical features; considerable overlap occurs with features of allergic asthma Differential Diagnosis for Tracheomalacia Structural Airway Abnormalities Laryngomalacia Softening and collapse of supraglottic structures causing inspiratory stridor, often coexisting with tracheomalacia in infants. Bronchomalacia Weakness and collapse of bronchial walls, causing wheezing and recurrent infections. Vascular Rings and Slings Congenital vascular anomalies (e.g., double aortic arch, pulmonary sling) compressing the trachea externally. Tracheal Stenosis Fixed narrowing of the trachea due to congenital or acquired causes (e.g., prolonged intubation, trauma). Tracheal Web or Atresia Congenital membrane or absence of tracheal segments causing obstruction. Infectious and Inflammatory Causes Tracheitis (Bacterial or Viral) Infection causing airway inflammation and edema mimicking airway collapse. Granulomatous Diseases Such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis causing airway narrowing. Neuromuscular Disorders Conditions causing poor airway muscle tone leading to dynamic airway collapse (e.g., muscular dystrophies). Foreign Body Aspiration Partial airway obstruction causing wheezing and respiratory distress. Tumors or Masses Intratracheal or extrinsic masses compressing or invading the airway. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Emphysema In adults, airway collapse due to loss of elastic recoil and cartilage weakening. Epidemiology OF Tracheomalacia All types of tracheomalacia are extremely rare; no definite incidence rates are available. In a total of 512 bronchoscopies, airway malacia was diagnosed in 160 children (94 males) at a median age of 4.0 years (range, 0-17 y). Airway malacia was classified as primary in 136 children and as secondary in 24 children. The incidence of primary airway malacia was estimated to be at least 1 in 2100. medications used, their purposes, and potential side effects Medications Used in Tracheomalacia Treatment Additional Non-Drug Therapies Humidified air and chest physiotherapy to clear secretions and reduce airway irritation. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (CPAP or BiPAP) to stent open airways during breathing, especially at night. Surgical interventions (for severe cases) such as aortopexy, tracheopexy, tracheostomy, airway stenting, or tracheal reconstruction. Important Notes on Medication Use Medications like ipratropium bromide and bronchodilators help improve airway tone but do not cure tracheomalacia; they manage symptoms. Corticosteroids are used cautiously due to side effects and are typically reserved for cases with significant airway inflammation. Treating respiratory infections promptly with antibiotics is critical, as infections can worsen airway collapse. Many infants improve as their tracheal cartilage strengthens with growth, reducing the need for long-term medication. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q1. How severe is the condition? A. Severity is usually assessed by the degree of airway collapse during breathing, especially exhalation: Mild: 25–50% airway lumen narrowing Moderate: 50–75% narrowing Severe: >75% narrowing, sometimes near complete collapse Severity also depends on symptoms and whether collapse occurs during quiet breathing or only with coughing or agitation. Flexible bronchoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis and severity assessment, but interpretation can vary between clinicians. Q2. What caused the condition? A. Tracheomalacia can be: Congenital: due to underdeveloped or soft tracheal cartilage present from birth Acquired: caused by prolonged intubation, trauma, inflammation, external compression (e.g., vascular rings), chronic infections, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults Risk factors include obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Q3. What treatment do you recommend? A. Treatment depends on severity and symptoms: Mild cases often improve with conservative management (humidified air, airway clearance, treating infections) Medical therapies may include bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics if infections occur Noninvasive ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP) can help stent open airways during breathing Severe cases may require surgical interventions like aortopexy, tracheopexy, or airway stenting. Q4. Will surgery be necessary? A. Surgery is usually reserved for: Severe tracheomalacia causing significant airway obstruction or respiratory distress Failure of conservative and medical management Associated anatomical abnormalities causing external airway compression The decision depends on clinical symptoms, airway collapse severity, and response to other treatments. Q5. What can I do to ease symptoms? A. Use humidified air to keep airways moist Avoid respiratory irritants like smoke and pollutants Promptly treat respiratory infections with antibiotics if needed Practice airway clearance techniques as advised Use prescribed inhalers or medications properly Monitor for worsening symptoms and seek medical attention if breathing difficulty increases. Q6. How soon do I need treatment? A. Mild cases may only require monitoring and supportive care. Moderate to severe cases with symptoms like stridor, recurrent infections, or respiratory distress need prompt evaluation and treatment. If symptoms worsen rapidly (e.g., severe breathing difficulty, cyanosis), emergency care is necessary What conditions might be confused for tracheomalacia? The following conditions may be confused for tracheomalacia: Laryngomalacia: This condition refers to floppy tissue above your voice box. Your voice box sits above your windpipe. Tracheobronchomalacia: This describes weak bronchi (the tubes that run from your windpipe to your lungs). Some people with tracheomalacia also have tracheobronchomalacia. GENOMIC DATA OF Tracheomalacia Tracheomalacia can be associated with genetic syndromes and congenital anomalies. It often occurs alongside conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Mounier-Kuhn syndrome, and other connective tissue disorders that affect cartilage strength and elasticity. Some cases of congenital tracheomalacia are linked to mutations affecting cartilage development and extracellular matrix proteins, though specific causative genes for isolated tracheomalacia are not well defined. A rare autosomal recessive condition involving mutations in the DCHS1 gene (encoding protocadherin-16) has been associated with tracheomalacia among other systemic features like intellectual disability. However, this is not a common cause of isolated tracheomalacia. Tracheomalacia frequently coexists with other congenital malformations such as tracheoesophageal fistula, vascular rings, and esophageal atresia, which have complex embryological and genetic backgrounds. Most cases of tracheomalacia are considered multifactorial or developmental anomalies rather than single-gene disorders. There is no routine genetic testing for isolated tracheomalacia, and it is often sporadic without clear inheritance patterns DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Tracheomalacia Doctor: Hello, I understand your child has been having noisy breathing and some coughing. After reviewing the tests, it looks like your child has a condition called tracheomalacia. Have you heard of this before? Parent: No, I haven’t. What exactly is tracheomalacia? Doctor: Tracheomalacia means that the cartilage in the windpipe, or trachea, is softer than usual. This softness can cause the airway to partially collapse when your child breathes out, leading to noisy breathing, coughing, or sometimes difficulty breathing. Parent: Is this serious? Will it get worse? Doctor: In many cases, especially in infants and young children, tracheomalacia improves as the cartilage strengthens with growth. Mild to moderate cases often get better over time without surgery. However, if the airway collapse is severe, it can cause breathing difficulties that need closer monitoring or treatment. Parent: What causes tracheomalacia? Doctor: It can be present from birth due to how the trachea developed, or it can develop later from injury, infections, or pressure from nearby blood vessels. Sometimes it occurs along with other conditions like vascular rings or certain genetic syndromes. Parent: What treatments are available? Doctor: Treatment depends on how severe the symptoms are. For mild cases, we usually recommend supportive care like humidified air, avoiding irritants, and monitoring. If infections occur, they are treated promptly. In more severe cases, medications such as inhalers or breathing support like CPAP might be needed. Surgery is rarely necessary but can be considered if symptoms are severe or don’t improve. Parent: What should I watch for at home? Doctor: Watch for signs of increased breathing difficulty, bluish color around lips or face, poor feeding, or frequent respiratory infections. If any of these happen, seek medical care promptly. Parent: How long will this last? Doctor: Many children improve by the time they are 1 to 2 years old as their airway cartilage becomes stronger. We will follow your child closely and adjust treatment as needed. Parent: Thank you, doctor. This helps me understand what’s going on. Doctor: You’re welcome. Please feel free to ask any questions anytime, and we’ll work together to support your child’s breathing health.

Acquired Bronchomalacia Develops later due to inflammation, trauma, or external compression. Bronchial Cartilage Softening Describes the underlying pathology of weakened bronchial walls. Dynamic Bronchial Collapse Refers to airway collapse during breathing caused by bronchial wall weakness. Airway Malacia (Bronchomalacia subtype) A broader term including tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia. Bronchial Collapse Syndrome Emphasizes the functional airway obstruction caused by bronchial wall weakness. DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Bronchomalacia Bronchomalacia is a condition where the cartilage in the bronchi is weak. Your bronchi are flexible but firm airways in your lungs. Normally, c-shaped cartilage structures surround your bronchi like protective shells. These firm structures allow your bronchi to open as your lungs expand and contract. Without their support, your bronchi become narrow, especially during exhalation (when you breathe out). Bronchomalacia usually affects newborns, especially those who were born prematurely (early) and those with Down syndrome. In rare cases, it affects older children and adults. How does bronchomalacia affect my baby? Bronchomalacia can block or narrow the bronchi. When the bronchi are blocked or too narrow, your baby may have breathing problems and difficulty getting enough oxygen. In very severe cases, the condition can be life-threatening. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) In many cases, people with bronchomalacia also have tracheomalacia, which is a weakness in the tracheal walls. These two conditions together are called tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). Like bronchomalacia, tracheomalacia can interfere with breathing and is more common in newborns. Tracheomalacia is often linked to a rare birth defect known as esophageal atresia causes OF bronchomalacia Bronchomalacia in newborns, known as primary bronchomalacia, is usually a result of: Congenital heart disease. Underdeveloped lung cartilage due to being born early. Williams-Campbell syndrome: Congenital (inherited) condition that causes weakened cartilage in the bronchi. Bronchomalacia that isn’t present at birth is known as secondary bronchomalacia, and causes include: Chest injury. Chronic bronchitis. Emphysema. Long-term ventilator therapy. Tuberculosis (TB). Tumors or benign (noncancerous) growths in the lungs. symptoms of bronchomalacia If you or your child has bronchomalacia, you may notice: Barking cough without phlegm. Cyanosis (blue-tinted skin). Fatigue. Frequent infections like colds and respiratory illnesses. Shortness of breath (dyspnea). Stridor (noisy, vibrating sound when breathing). Wheezing. Is bronchomalacia contagious? You cannot catch bronchomalacia from someone else or spread it to others. Bronchomalacia is not caused by upper respiratory infections, influenza (flu) or other contagious illnesses. Diagnosis and Tests OF Bronchomalacia Your provider will perform a physical examination and listen to your or your child’s lungs. If appropriate, they’ll order additional testing or place additional referrals. Imaging tests allow your provider to see inside the lungs. You or your baby may need: Bronchoscopy. CT scan. MRI. X-ray. Management and Treatment OF Bronchomalacia Newborns with mild bronchomalacia may only need regular check-ins with their healthcare provider. The condition often resolves on its own by 6 months of age as their lungs mature. If bronchomalacia is interfering with your baby’s oxygen levels, providers may recommend a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. A CPAP device is a mask that goes over your baby’s nose and mouth and connects to a machine. The machine delivers gentle, continuous air pressure to the mask. The air pressure can help keep the bronchi open. Your baby may need this device for a few weeks or until their lungs have fully developed. In very severe cases of bronchomalacia and respiratory failure, your baby may need a ventilator to keep their bronchi open and help them breathe. Bronchomalacia treatment in adults depends on the cause. If you have emphysema or chronic bronchitis, you may need medications and regular checkups to help manage your symptoms. A CPAP device may also be helpful, especially when sleeping. In severe cases, patients may need ventilator support in a hospital. Outlook / Prognosis OF Bronchomalacia Many babies with bronchomalacia recover and thrive once their lung cartilage has matured and hardened. If the condition is caused by a blockage like a tumor, removing the blockage usually cures bronchomalacia. In adults with emphysema or chronic bronchitis, bronchomalacia usually requires ongoing care and can’t be cured. However, your healthcare provider can help you manage symptoms and feel better. Prevention OF Bronchomalacia There’s no known way to prevent bronchomalacia in newborns. It is not a result of something you did during pregnancy. If you’re pregnant, learn the signs of premature labor so you can seek medical care right away. Prompt care may prevent your baby from being born too early. Because bronchomalacia in adults is often a result of lung disease, good lung care may help prevent it. Adults can take these steps to keep their lungs as healthy as possible: Don’t smoke or vape. Smoking and vaping raise the risk of chronic bronchitis, emphysema and lung cancer. If you do smoke and need help quitting, talk to your provider. Get your home tested for radon. You can’t see or smell radon gas in your home, but it can cause lung cancer. Wear personal protective equipment (PPE). A respirator should be worn when you’re working with chemicals or particles like gases, vapors, fumes, dust and soot. When should I see my healthcare provider? See your provider regularly for well checkups and to discuss any changes to your health. Seek emergency care if you or your child has: Bluish lips or skin. Chest retractions (pulling inward with breathing). Fainting or inability to wake. Shortness of breath or trouble breathing. Wheezing or stridor. Differential Diagnosis for Bronchomalacia Primary Bronchomalacia (Congenital) Due to deficiency or weakness of cartilaginous rings in the bronchi, typically presenting in infants with wheezing and recurrent respiratory infections. Secondary Bronchomalacia (Acquired) Caused by extrinsic compression from vascular anomalies (e.g., vascular rings), bronchogenic cysts, inflammation, trauma, or chronic infections. Tracheomalacia / Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) Involvement of the trachea along with bronchi; symptoms and airway collapse overlap with bronchomalacia. Asthma Reversible airway obstruction causing wheezing and cough, often confused with bronchomalacia in infants. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) In adults, airway collapse and obstruction can mimic bronchomalacia symptoms. Bronchogenic Cyst Congenital cystic lesion causing airway compression and symptoms similar to bronchomalacia. Vascular Rings and Slings Congenital vascular anomalies compressing the airway externally, causing wheezing and respiratory distress. Foreign Body Aspiration Partial airway obstruction causing wheezing and cough. Tracheal or Bronchial Stenosis Fixed airway narrowing due to congenital or acquired causes. Laryngomalacia Softening of the laryngeal structures causing stridor, often coexisting with bronchomalacia. Recurrent Respiratory Infections May cause airway inflammation and mimic symptoms of bronchomalacia. Epidemiology of Bronchomalacia: In a large study of 459 children with airway malacia, bronchomalacia (BM) was the most common type, present in 94.8% of cases. It affected the right lung in 53.3% of patients, the left lung in 11%, and both lungs in 35.6%. The condition is more frequently diagnosed in male children aged 2 years or younger, consistent with other studies showing a male predominance and early childhood onset. The incidence of primary airway malacia (including bronchomalacia) is estimated to be at least 1 in 2,100 children in the general population. Among children undergoing bronchoscopy for respiratory symptoms, airway malacia (including bronchomalacia) is diagnosed in approximately 1% to 4.5% of cases. Bronchomalacia often coexists with tracheomalacia or tracheobronchomalacia, and its clinical presentation can overlap with other respiratory conditions such as asthma or recurrent pneumonia. Severity varies, with most patients showing mild to moderate malacia; severe cases are less common but associated with more frequent and severe respiratory infections DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Bronchomalacia Doctor: Hello, I understand you or your child has been experiencing wheezing and difficulty breathing. After reviewing the tests, it appears there is a condition called bronchomalacia. Are you familiar with this term? Patient/Parent: No, I haven’t heard of bronchomalacia before. What does it mean? Doctor: Bronchomalacia means that the cartilage in the bronchi—the airways inside the lungs—is softer and weaker than normal. This causes the airways to narrow or collapse, especially when breathing out, which can lead to wheezing, coughing, and sometimes trouble breathing. Patient/Parent: Is this a serious condition? Will it get worse? Doctor: It depends on the severity. Many infants, especially those born prematurely, have mild bronchomalacia that improves as they grow and their airways strengthen. In adults or severe cases, it might cause more persistent symptoms and require treatment. Patient/Parent: What causes bronchomalacia? Doctor: It can be congenital, meaning present from birth due to how the airways developed, or acquired later from infections, inflammation, or pressure from nearby blood vessels or masses. Patient/Parent: How do you treat it? Doctor: Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing infections. Mild cases may only need supportive care like humidified air and monitoring. In some cases, inhalers or breathing support devices like CPAP can help. Surgery is rarely needed but may be considered for severe cases. Patient/Parent: What should I watch for? Doctor: Watch for worsening wheezing, difficulty breathing, frequent respiratory infections, or if you notice any bluish color around the lips or face. If these occur, seek medical attention promptly. Patient/Parent: How long will this last? Doctor: Many children improve by age 2 as their airways mature. Adults may have persistent symptoms depending on the cause. We will monitor and adjust treatment as needed. Patient/Parent: Thank you for explaining. It helps me understand what’s going on. Doctor: You’re welcome. Please feel free to ask any questions anytime. REFERENCES Bronchomalacia: Definition, Treatment & Causes https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9003852/ Laryngomalacia Alternative Names: Congenital laryngomalacia Floppy larynx Laryngeal flaccidity Infantile laryngomalacia Supraglottic laryngomalacia DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Laryngomalacia Laryngomalacia (lah-ring-oh-ma-LAY-shia) is a larynx (voice box) abnormality that can happen in newborn babies. It occurs when weak, floppy tissues above the voice box temporarily fall back over the airway. It’s the most common cause of noisy breathing in babies. Laryngomalacia sounds like a high-pitched squeak (stridor) when your baby breathes in. It usually isn’t serious. But in severe cases, it can cause breathing and feeding issues, among other complications. Congenital laryngomalacia (meaning you’re born with it) is common in infants. Over half of all newborn babies have it during the first week of life, and even more develop it when they’re 2 to 4 weeks old. Laryngomalacia can also occur in adults, but it’s rare. (Healthcare providers refer to this as acquired laryngomalacia.) causes laryngomalacia Experts aren’t exactly sure why some babies develop laryngomalacia and others don’t. But they have a few theories about why it happens, in general: Structural abnormalities: The cartilage or muscles around the voice box form atypically (differently) during fetal development. Neuromuscular disorders: These include disorders that affect the vocal cord nerves and muscles. GERD: If acid reflux reaches the voice box, it can cause swelling in the area. This can worsen any structural abnormalities causing laryngomalacia. Types of laryngomalacia Healthcare providers categorize laryngomalacia into three types according to cause: Type 1: The mucous membranes of the voice box are too tight or too short. Type 2: The upper part of the voice box has excess soft tissue. Type 3: An underlying disorder (like GERD or neuromuscular disorder) causes laryngomalacia. symptoms of laryngomalacia Laryngomalacia symptoms can range from mild to severe. Loud, noisy or squeaky breathing is the main thing to watch for. This often worsens over the first several months but resolves within a year or two. Most babies with laryngomalacia have no trouble breathing or feeding, even when their breathing sounds concerning. Breathing usually gets louder when lying down, sleeping, crying or feeding. Babies with severe laryngomalacia may have these symptoms: Apnea (long pauses in breathing). Aspiration (pulling food into the lungs). Cyanosis (a condition that causes the skin to develop a bluish hue). Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Inability to gain weight. “Tugging” or “pulling in” at the neck or chest when breathing. If your baby shows any of the symptoms listed above, call their pediatrician right away Diagnosis and Tests OF Laryngomalacia Nasopharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL) is the main test healthcare providers use to diagnose laryngomalacia. An otolaryngologist (ENT) uses a scope with a tiny camera (endoscopy) to view your baby’s voice box. They’ll gently guide the scope into your baby’s nostril and down their throat. Providers can do this routine test in about two to five minutes. Other laryngomalacia tests If your baby has laryngomalacia, their provider may need to run other tests to determine the extent of the condition. These tests may include: Airway fluoroscopy: This procedure combines X-rays and a contrast agent (like dye) that illuminates affected areas within your baby’s body. Your provider may do this as a swallow study to see how laryngomalacia affects your baby’s swallowing function. Impedance probe: A healthcare provider inserts a small tube through your baby’s nose and into their esophagus. Then, they use a measuring device to see how much stomach acid reaches your baby’s voice box. Babies who have this procedure usually stay for at least one night in the hospital. Microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (ML&B): A healthcare provider uses a lighted scope to examine your baby’s trachea (windpipe) and voice box to see what’s causing loud breathing. They’ll do this procedure under general anesthesia. Neck or chest X-rays: These imaging tests can tell your healthcare provider if your baby has any structural abnormalities that may cause noisy breathing. Management and Treatment OF Laryngomalacia Most of the time, laryngomalacia goes away on its own within a year or two and the noisy breathing improves over time. In mild cases, you can manage your baby’s symptoms at home. But if your baby has severe laryngomalacia, they might need medication or surgery. Treatment at home If your baby has mild symptoms, you can usually keep an eye on things at home. Laryngomalacia management depends on your baby’s unique situation: If your baby has trouble with feeding, you may need to feed them more often to make up for lost calories and nutrition. You can also try thickening their formula. (You can do this with infant cereal or over-the-counter thickeners.) This increases the “stickiness” of their food so it’s less likely to come back up into their esophagus. If your baby has breathing difficulties, your provider might recommend elevating the head of their mattress. This may help open their airway. Ask your provider about specific ways to manage your baby’s laryngomalacia symptoms. Medication When GERD occurs with laryngomalacia, your baby’s provider may prescribe an anti-reflux medication like a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker. GERD can worsen swelling associated with laryngomalacia, so it’s important to keep reflux in check if it’s a contributing factor. Surgery Laryngomalacia surgery involves trimming the weak, floppy tissue above your baby’s voice box. This procedure is a supraglottoplasty. An ENT surgeon will do a supraglottoplasty in an operating room while your child is under general anesthesia. Your baby will typically stay overnight in the hospital for observation. How long will it take for my baby to feel better after treatment? Anti-reflux medication usually improves symptoms within two weeks. But your baby will probably need to stay on the medication for several weeks or months. If your baby had laryngomalacia surgery, their breathing may sound worse for a few days. This is normal. It’s due to post-op inflammation (swelling) around their vocal cords. The noisy breathing should gradually improve, with full recovery taking about two weeks. Outlook / Prognosis OF Laryngomalacia Despite the noisy breathing, laryngomalacia is usually not dangerous. While most babies outgrow laryngomalacia, a few will need surgery to correct the issue, especially if they’re having trouble gaining weight or are having severe breathing difficulties. Your healthcare provider can tell you what to expect if your baby receives a diagnosis. Laryngomalacia usually goes away on its own by age 1 or 2. But you should keep an eye out for severe symptoms like apnea and a bluish color around their lips. These things can cause serious complications. Prevention OF Laryngomalacia You can’t prevent laryngomalacia. But you can manage your baby’s symptoms with treatment. As a parent, you want to shield your baby from all harm. But laryngomalacia is just something that happens. It doesn’t mean you’ve done something wrong. Although the sounds your child makes may be scary at first, treatment may not be necessary. When should I call my baby’s healthcare provider? If your baby shows symptoms of laryngomalacia, like noisy breathing, consider scheduling an appointment with your healthcare provider. They can examine your baby and make recommendations for referral to ENT, home care and management. Call your provider right away if your baby develops sudden symptoms, or if they have GERD. Head to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Stops breathing for more than 10 seconds at a time. Has a “tugging” or “pulling in” at the chest or neck when breathing. Turns blue around the lips. Differential Diagnoses OF Laryngomalacia Congenital Stridor Croup Hypocalcemia Pediatric Airway Foreign Body Pediatric Gastroesophageal Reflux Pediatric Subglottic Stenosis Surgery Respiratory Papillomatosis Unilateral vocal fold paralysis typically presents after a surgical procedure in the thoracic cavity or the neck, though it can be congenital as well. A hoarse cry is common, and these infants may have difficulties feeding. When bilateral vocal fold paralysis is present, infants typically have biphasic stridor and may require a tracheostomy if there is significant respiratory distress. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy is used to diagnose these conditions. Laryngeal papillomatosis may cause a hoarse cry with upper airway obstruction, which may present early in infancy, and diagnosis is by either flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy or direct laryngoscopy and biopsy of the lesions. Subglottic hemangiomas are a rare cause of stridor, typically expiratory. Hemangiomas in a beard-like distribution are clinically suggestive of subglottic extension or occult subglottic hemangioma. Confirmation is achievable with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. Subglottic stenosis is usually congenital in patients in this age group, though it may also result from scarring of the subglottic region following prolonged intubation. Stridor may be heard but does not change with the infant\\'s position. Tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia may be present along with laryngomalacia. Expiratory airway sounds are generally present. Diagnosis is via bronchoscopy. A vascular ring is a rare cause of airway obstruction. Feeding difficulties and stridor may be present. Diagnostic confirmation is with a contrasted computed tomography scan of the chest. This condition should be a suspected diagnosis with tracheomalacia seen on bronchoscopy or compression of the esophagus seen on an esophagram. Foreign body aspiration is a possibility after finding an infant in respiratory distress after being unaccompanied or after ingesting food, causing a choking or coughing event. Diagnosis is suggested with chest x-ray findings and decreased unilateral breath sounds. Bronchoscopy should be performed to diagnose and retrieve the foreign body. Epidemiology OF Laryngomalacia United States statistics Frequency is unknown. Often, the diagnosis is presumed. Race-, sex-, and age-related demographics Race No known race predilection has been reported. Sex Although previous reports in predominately White populations have reported a male predominance (58-76% of cases), a more recent study of a more ethnically diverse population demonstrated no significant difference between males and females. Age Although this is a congenital lesion, airway sounds typically begin at age 4-6 weeks. Until that age, inspiratory flow rates may not be high enough to generate the sounds. Symptoms typically peak at age 6-8 months and remit by age 2 years. Late-onset laryngomalacia may be a distinct entity, which can present after age 2 years. Procedures OF Laryngomalacia Laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy These studies are the best studies used to confirm the diagnosis. However, in an infant with typical inspiratory noises (worse when supine) who has a normal cry and normal growth and development, clinical diagnosis is not unreasonable. A pediatric pulmonologist or pediatric otorhinolaryngologist may perform flexible laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy under anesthesia has been shown to be more sensitive and specific than bronchoscopy in infants who are awake. Direct visualization of the airway reveals an omega-shaped epiglottis that prolapses over the larynx during inspiration. Enlarged arytenoid cartilages that prolapse over the larynx during inspiration may also be present. The International Pediatric Otolaryngology Group recommends that microlaryngotracheobronchoscopy to detect synchronous airway lesions be reserved for patients with severe, progressive, or atypical disease. Drug Treatment Anti-reflux medications are commonly prescribed when GERD coexists with laryngomalacia, as reflux can worsen laryngeal swelling and noisy breathing. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (e.g., omeprazole) H2 receptor blockers (e.g., ranitidine) These medications help reduce acid reflux, thereby decreasing inflammation and improving symptoms indirectly. Side Effects of Anti-reflux Medications: PPIs: Headache Diarrhea or constipation Increased risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections with prolonged use Possible nutrient malabsorption (e.g., magnesium, calcium, vitamin B12) with long-term use H2 blockers: Headache Dizziness Diarrhea or constipation Rarely, confusion or arrhythmias in sensitive individuals Surgical Treatment Supraglottoplasty is the preferred surgical procedure for severe laryngomalacia. It involves trimming or releasing the floppy supraglottic tissues to open the airway. Tracheotomy is rarely performed and reserved for very severe cases or when other treatments fail. Genetic and Genomic Insight OF Laryngomalacia Genetic Mutations and Hereditary Patterns: Congenital laryngomalacia can be caused by genetic mutations (pathogenic variants), some of which may be hereditary. There is evidence supporting autosomal dominant transmission in certain families, indicating a genetic predisposition in some cases. Associated Genetic Syndromes: About 8–20% of infants with laryngomalacia have congenital anomalies or genetic syndromes, rising to 40% in severe cases requiring surgery. The most commonly reported genetic disorder associated with laryngomalacia is Down syndrome, where about 50% of affected children have respiratory symptoms including laryngomalacia. Genes Implicated: Several genes have been linked to laryngomalacia or related phenotypes, often through studies of mouse models and ClinVar genetic variation databases. Notable genes include: WFS1, NFIX, MECP2, CHD7, ARID1B, KIF1A, PHOX2B, COL2A1, ATP4A, ATP12A, UBE3B, SHOC2 among others. These genes are involved in nervous system development, craniofacial formation, gene regulation, and other biological processes relevant to airway structure and function. PREDEFINED Questions and answers ON Laryngomalacia Q. Laryngomalacia vs. tracheomalacia: What’s the difference? A. Both laryngomalacia and tracheomalacia are conditions affecting the airway. While laryngomalacia refers to floppy tissues above the voice box, the characteristics of tracheomalacia include floppy or weak cartilage of the windpipe, which is below the voice box. Tracheomalacia is far less common — and usually more serious — than laryngomalacia. Q. Can laryngomalacia cause weight gain? A. Not usually. In fact, babies with severe laryngomalacia may struggle to gain weight. Q. What worsens laryngomalacia? A. Lying on their back could make your baby’s laryngomalacia symptoms worse. If you notice that your baby is having difficulty breathing when sleeping on their back, please see your healthcare provider. Additionally, GERD — which is common in babies with laryngomalacia — may make their symptoms worse. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Laryngomalacia Doctor: \"Good morning. We\\'re here to discuss your child\\'s noisy breathing. Based on the examination and what you\\'ve described, I suspect it might be laryngomalacia. Have you heard of that before?\" Parent: \"I\\'ve heard the term, but I\\'m not entirely sure what it means. What exactly is it?\" Doctor: \"Laryngomalacia is a common condition in infants where the tissues above the voice box are soft and floppy. When your child breathes in, these tissues can collapse slightly into the airway, causing that noisy sound, which we call stridor.\" Parent: \"So, the noisy breathing is the main thing we should look out for? We first noticed it a couple of weeks after birth.\" Doctor: \"Yes, inspiratory stridor is the main symptom, and it often appears shortly after birth, typically around two weeks. It can sometimes sound worse when your child is eating, crying, sleeping, or lying down. We often see it worsen between 6 to 8 months of age before gradually improving.\" Parent: \"Is it serious? Should I be worried?\" Doctor: \"In about 90% of cases, laryngomalacia is mild and resolves on its own as the child grows, usually by 18 to 20 months of age. Many children with mild cases thrive despite the noisy breathing. However, we do categorize it as mild, moderate, or severe based on associated symptoms, not just how loud the stridor is.\" Parent: \"What are those other symptoms that would make it more serious?\" Doctor: \"We look for signs like significant breathing difficulties, such as stopping breathing (apneas), episodes where the skin turns blue, or if they need extra oxygen. We also watch for feeding difficulties, such as choking or poor weight gain, as these can indicate a more moderate or severe case. If your child is growing well and doesn\\'t have these other issues, it\\'s likely a mild case.\" Parent: \"How do you confirm the diagnosis?\" Doctor: \"To confirm the diagnosis, we\\'ll refer you to a pediatric ENT specialist. They\\'ll perform a procedure called a flexible laryngoscopy. It involves passing a thin, flexible tube through your child\\'s nose to look at their airway and vocal cords directly. This allows us to see how the laryngeal structures move during breathing and rule out other causes of stridor, like vocal cord paralysis or a laryngeal cyst.\" Parent: \"And what about treatment? Is there anything we need to do?\" Doctor: \"For most mild cases, we\\'ll monitor your child\\'s growth and development closely. Many infants with laryngomalacia also experience gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), which can worsen the noisy breathing. If reflux is a problem, we might prescribe anti-reflux medication to help manage it. In rare, severe cases where there are significant breathing problems or poor weight gain, a surgical procedure called a supraglottoplasty might be considered to trim the floppy tissue and open the airway.\" Parent: \"So, for now, it\\'s mostly observation and keeping an eye on things?\" Doctor: \"Exactly. We\\'ll focus on supportive care, monitoring their feeding, breathing, and growth. We\\'ll schedule follow-up appointments to track their progress. If you notice any of those more severe symptoms we discussed, or have any other concerns, please don\\'t hesitate to contact us immediately REFERENCES Laryngomalacia: Symptoms, Causes & Treatment https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1002527-treatment https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544266/#article-24056.s9 Chest Wall Deformities Common Alternative Names and Terms: Thoracic deformities Thoracic cage abnormalities Thoracic wall deformities Chest cage deformities Pectus deformities (when referring specifically to pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum) Rib cage deformities Chest wall anomalies Thoracic skeletal abnormalities DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Chest Wall Deformities Chest wall deformities are conditions that cause physical abnormalities of the chest. The two most common types of chest wall deformities are: Pectus Excavatum Also known as funnel chest or sunken chest, pectus excavatum causes the chest to be depressed (turn inwards) at the sternum (breastbone). It is the most common form of chest wall deformity. Patients may be born with the condition, or it can develop later in adolescence. Pectus Carinatum Also known as pigeon chest or protruding chest, this condition causes the sternum and ribs to protrude. It can be caused by an excessive growth of cartilage. Pectus Carinatum can be present from birth or appear during adolescence, triggered by a growth spurt at puberty. It can also appear following surgery on the heart during which the sternum splits. Poland syndrome: Poland syndrome is a rare condition characterized by underdeveloped or absent chest muscles on one side, often accompanied by hand abnormalities. Sternal cleft: Sternal cleft is a rare congenital condition where the sternum does not fuse properly during fetal development, resulting in a visible split or gap. Rib abnormalities: Abnormalities of the ribs, such as fused ribs, missing ribs, or extra ribs, can contribute to chest wall deformities. Causes Of Chest Wall Deformities The causes of chest wall deformities can vary, including: Genetic factors: Certain chest wall deformities, such as pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum, can have a genetic component and may run in families. Fetal development: In some cases, chest wall deformities result from disruptions in fetal development, leading to abnormalities in the formation of the sternum, ribs, or chest muscles. Connective tissue disorders: Some connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can predispose individuals to chest wall deformities. Environmental factors: External factors, such as intrauterine compression or mechanical forces on the chest during fetal development, may contribute to chest wall deformities. Causes of Pectus Excavatum include: Hereditary Poland Syndrome Marfan syndrome Scoliosis Rickets Causes of Pectus Carinatum include: Present at birth Homocystinuria Trisomy 21 Trisomy 18 Marfan syndrome Multiple lentigines syndrome Morquio syndrome Osteogenesis imperfecta How are Chest Wall Deformities Diagnosed? Pectus Excavatum Doctors may use computed tomography (CT) scans to see the chest’s internal structures and the degree of depression. Something called the Haller index is used to measure how severe the depression is. Pulmonary function tests and cardiac evaluations may be performed to understand how the deformity is impacting the patient. Pectus Carinatum The condition is usually diagnosed in young people, with a doctor performing a thorough physical examination. They may also take photographs of the chest and take measurements to monitor the condition. Treatment OF Chest Wall Deformities Pectus Excavatum Surgery is required to treat a sunken chest. The preferred option is the minimally invasive Nuss procedure. It involves making small incisions under the arm pits and another to insert a very small camera. A surgeon implants metal bars underneath the sternum to elevate it. The results of the surgery are immediately felt by the patient. The bars can be removed one or two years later, when the desired bone structure is established. The Ravitch procedure is an open surgery which involves opening the chest and removing sections of rib cartilage and then raising the sternum. The surgeon may implant struts, which are metal bars, which hold the chest wall in a normal position and reshape the chest. The struts can be removed around 6 months later. Pectus Carinatum A non-surgical option is a chest brace, which is custom built for each patient. The brace is worn over a period of time and reduces chest protrusion. In combination with exercise program, the therapy can completely correct the protrusion. Results are usually seen after around 6 months of treatment. For patients with more severe pectus carinatum, surgery may be required. This involves open surgery during which sections of rib cartilage are removed and the sternum flattened. Patients notice a correction in the deformity immediately after surgery. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF Chest Wall Deformities Pectus deformities Marfan syndrome is the hallmark entity of differential diagnosis; however, all related syndromes to pectus deformities are part of differential diagnosis constellation. Poland Syndrome Differential diagnoses in Poland syndrome highlights include normal breast asymmetry in females, and Swayer-James syndrome and giant bulla in hyper-lucent hemithorax RX setting. Sternal Clefts The differential diagnosis depends on syndromic association constellation. Highlights are limb body wall complex, amniotic band syndrome, and Cantrell pentalogy. Ectopia Cordis Differential diagnosis highlights are; trisomy 18 and Turner syndrome. Jeunes Syndrome Differential diagnosis highlights are; Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome, short rib polydactyly syndrome (I-IV types), Barnes syndrome, and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Jarcho-Levin syndrome Differential diagnosis highlights include spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Morquio syndrome, chondrodysplasia, Klippel-Feil syndrome, and short rib polydactyly syndrome EPIDEMIOLOGY OF Chest Wall Deformities Pectus Excavatum This anomaly represents 90% of chest wall deformities; it is more common in the White race with an incidence of 1 per 400 live births and 5 to 1 male predominance. Pectus excavatum could present as isolated non-familiar deformity; however, familiar non-syndromic positive history is present in up to 40%, highlighting an autosomal dominant inheritance patron. Pectus excavatum deformity can be part of genetic syndromes. Noonan and Marfan are the most important associated syndromes identified by POSSUM (Pictures Of Standard Syndromes and Undiagnosed Malformations version 5.7) and WBDD (Winter-Baraitser Dysmorphology Database version 1.0.14). It is of paramount importance that Poland syndrome rib hypoplasia causes secondary pectus excavatum, which could need modified Ravitch procedure repair. Less than 1% of pectus excavatum cases have an underlying connective tissue disorder. Data shows that 80% of cases get diagnosed at two years of life. Mitral valve prolapse (17%), arrhythmias (15%), and congenital heart disease (2%) are the most important cardiac anomalies related.MASS phenotype is present in two-thirds of pectus excavatum patients. Pectus Carinatum Is the second most common chest-wall deformity (5 to 6 times less common than pectus excavatum), has an incidence of 0.06% of live births with a 4 to 1 male predominance. Pectus carinatum could present as an isolated disease with a 25% to 30% positive family history, or can be part of genetic syndromes. As pectus excavatum, Marfan and Noonan are the most prevalent associated syndromes. Cardiac anomalies association could exist. Thoracolumbar scoliosis is linked to an underlying connective disorder in 12% to 14% of cases. Chondrogladiolar type is more common (95%). Pectus carinatum may present at any age; however, patients generally request medical attention at puberty. Poland Syndrome The average incidence is 1 in 20000 to 1 in 30000 live births with male predominance between 2 to 1 and 3 to 1. Unilateral presentation (over 90%) is considered a non-genetic disease. The deformity is most commonly right-sided in men (60% to 75%), females have no side tendency. Familial cases span less than 1% of cases (rare), highlighting bilateral or non-right sided with an equal male-to-female ratio as specific features. The left side anomaly is associated with dextrocardia. Poland syndrome has correlated with; Moebius anomaly, Klippel-Feil syndrome, renal anomalies, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, leiosarcoma, and lung cancer. Sternal Clefts Sternal clefts are the most common type of sternal defects and represent 0.15% of chest wall deformities. Of these, 67% are superior clefts,19.5% complete clefts,11% inferior clefts, and 2.5% sternal foramen. Sternal clefts incidence is difficult to estimate; however, there are reports of a female predominance of 2 to 1. Sternal clefts can be part of PHACES syndrome (90% female), midline fusion defects, and cavernous hemangiomata (female predominance), chromosome 22 syndromes, and 1 chromosome arrangement problems have been linked to sternal clefts by the POSSUM system. The inferior sternal cleft could be considered a pathognomonic sign of Cantrell pentalogy. The superior sternal cleft is commonly an isolated deformity. Ectopia Cordis It is an extremely rare chest-wall deformity with an estimated prevalence of 1 of 5.5 to 7.9 per million live births. Ectopia cordis types are thoracic (65% to 90%), thoracoabdominal (7% to 20%), and cervical (2.8 %). Ectopia cordis may occur as an isolated condition; however, it has a strong association with congenital heart diseases or other midline defects. Fallot tetralogy is the most common congenital cardiac defect. Thoracoabdominal ectopia cordis highlights include high indices of left ventricle diverticulum and Cantrell pentalogy association. Omphalocele is the most common abdominal defect associated with ectopia cordis. Jeunes Syndrome The incidence is 1 per 120000 live births. Most deaths occur in half to three-fourths of cases in the first two years of life. Skeletal chest wall growth arrest is the most serious complication core. Clavicle, limbs, pelvis, renal, hepatic, pancreatic are the main malformations that correlate with Jeune syndrome. Jarcho-Levin syndrome Epidemiological data are scarce. Spondylothoracic dysostosis incidence is unknown. It has an autosomal recessive inheritance patron linked to chromosome 2q32.1, without DLL3 gene mutation, it does not demonstrate gender predilection. Puerto Rican ancestry history is commonly positive. Most deaths (80 to 100%) occur in infancy; however, reports exist of mild phenotypes cases with a good prognosis. Spondylocostal dysostosis has a reported prevalence of 0.25 per 10000 births and demonstrates a better prognosis. This phenotype has both dominant and recessive autosomal inheritance, with the DLL3 (chromosome 19) and MESP2 (chromosome 15) gene mutation. Also, MESP2 mutation has links to the ethnic Puerto Rican group. Other anomalies associated with Jarcho Levin syndrome are a short trunk, dwarfism, craniofacial anomalies, short and rigid neck, inguinal and abdominal hernias, urinary tract anomalies, and talipes equinovarus PROGNOSIS OF Chest Wall Deformities Pectus Excavatum Surgical correction is achieved with open and MARPE surgery with satisfactory results (86% to 98.1%), from a functional standpoint, cardio-pulmonary fitness performance improve at 6 to 12 months after surgery.Mitral valve prolapse related to pectus excavatum resolution occurs in 50 % of cases after surgical repair. Pectus Carinatum Highlighting that minimally invasive surgery still needs more evidence support and acceptance, pectus carinatum surgical repair results are based on the modified Ravitch repair principles, therefore in several series, outcomes, and prognosis (esthetic satisfaction and symptomatology improvement) homogeneity results between both pectus deformities have been demonstrated. For bracing treatment, anatomical changes can be observed within 2 to 3 months of its use, bracing treatment duration is from 2 to 2.5 years; however, there are reports that the bracing device is poorly tolerated. Poland Syndrome Prognosis will depend on age, gender, phenotype severity, associated cancer if coexisting, and type of surgical reconstruction if indicated. Sternal Clefts Prognosis and outcomes will depend on defect phenotype, age, and associated anomalies. Superior sternal clefts commonly present as an isolated feature with an orthotropic hearth without significant intra-cardiac abnormalities, so they have a good prognosis. In general, a better prognosis is achievable with an appropriate surgical repair timing (neonatal period); however, survival will depend more on the associated anomalies than sternal cleft. Ectopia Cordis Ectopia cordis general prognosis is poor. Thoracic ectopia cordis, complex congenital cardiac defects, and Cantrell pentalogy have the poorest prognosis. Thoracoabdominal ectopia cordis has been reported with a better prognosis due to the non-malrotated ectopic heart. Jeunes Syndrome Generally, Jeune\\'s syndrome prognosis is poor, and it has a reported mortality rate of 60 to 80%; however, some centers have reported up to a 50% chance of survival with surgery in mild cases. Survival prognosis may improve with age progression. Jarcho-Levin syndrome Prognosis will depend on phenotype. Spondylothoracic dysostosis generally is considered a lethal condition and surgery has no benefit; however, in some cases series, mild forms have been reported with up to 56% survival with aggressive medical treatment focused on respiratory function.Spondylocostal dysostosis has a better prognosis. VEPTR surgery has a more probable better prognosis. Both phenotypes have normal intellectual development, and the overall prognosis improves if patients reach six months of age. Treatment of Chest Wall Deformities: Drug Information and Side Effects 1. Medical (Drug) Treatment Anti-inflammatory or pain medications: Used postoperatively or to manage discomfort related to chest wall deformities or surgery. Common drugs: NSAIDs (ibuprofen), acetaminophen Side effects: GI upset, kidney effects (NSAIDs), liver toxicity (acetaminophen in overdose) Medications for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): GERD can exacerbate symptoms in some patients with chest wall deformities, especially pectus excavatum. Drugs: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like omeprazole, H2 blockers Side effects: Headache, diarrhea, nutrient malabsorption with long-term use Physical therapy and exercise: No drugs involved but important non-pharmacologic adjunct to improve posture and respiratory function. 2. Non-Drug Treatments Bracing (mainly for pectus carinatum): Custom chest wall braces apply pressure to remodel the protruding sternum over time. No drug side effects but requires compliance. 3. Surgical Treatment Surgery is the mainstay for moderate to severe chest wall deformities, especially pectus excavatum and some cases of pectus carinatum. Nuss Procedure (Minimally invasive repair): A curved metal bar is inserted behind the sternum to elevate it. The bar remains for 2-3 years before removal. Risks/Side effects: Pain (managed with analgesics) Pneumothorax (collapsed lung) Infection Bar displacement or allergic reaction to metal Rare cardiac or lung injury Ravitch Procedure (Open surgery): Removal of abnormal cartilage and repositioning of the sternum, sometimes with metal struts. Risks/Side effects: Longer recovery and scarring Infection Bleeding Pain PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Chest Wall Deformities Q1. What are chest wall deformities? Answer: Chest wall deformities are structural abnormalities affecting the shape and structure of the chest. The most common types are pectus excavatum (sunken or funnel chest) and pectus carinatum (pigeon chest), which involve either a depression or protrusion of the breastbone and ribs. Q2. What causes chest wall deformities? Answer: The exact cause is often unknown but is thought to involve abnormal cartilage growth connecting the ribs to the sternum. Genetic factors may play a role, as these deformities often run in families. They can be congenital or develop during childhood, especially during growth spurts. Q3. What symptoms do chest wall deformities cause? Answer: Symptoms vary by severity. Mild cases may have no symptoms, while more severe deformities can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, reduced lung capacity, and sometimes cardiac compression. Cosmetic concerns and low self-esteem are common. Q4. How are chest wall deformities diagnosed? Answer: Diagnosis involves a physical exam and imaging studies such as chest X-rays, CT scans, or MRI. The Haller index from CT scans measures severity in pectus excavatum. Additional tests may include echocardiograms and pulmonary function tests to assess heart and lung impact. Q5. What treatment options are available? Answer: Treatment depends on severity and type: Observation for mild cases. Bracing for pectus carinatum to remodel the chest wall. Surgery (e.g., Nuss or Ravitch procedures) for moderate to severe pectus excavatum or carinatum, usually after the child reaches adolescence. Q6. When is surgery recommended? Answer: Surgery is typically recommended for moderate to severe deformities that cause symptoms such as breathing difficulties, chest pain, or significant cosmetic concerns. It is usually performed after the child’s bones have matured, often in adolescence. Q7. Can chest wall deformities affect breathing or heart function? Answer: Yes, severe deformities can compress the lungs and heart, leading to reduced lung capacity, shortness of breath, and cardiac symptoms like palpitations. This is why evaluation with pulmonary and cardiac tests is important. Q8. Are chest wall deformities hereditary? Answer: They often run in families, suggesting a genetic component. Certain connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome are also associated with chest wall deformities. Q9. What is the prognosis for children with chest wall deformities? Answer: Many children with mild deformities live normal lives without treatment. Those with severe deformities who undergo surgery generally have good outcomes with improved chest appearance and function. Q10. Are there any non-surgical treatments? Answer: Yes, bracing is effective for pectus carinatum in many cases, especially if started early. Physical therapy and exercises may help improve posture and respiratory function but do not correct the deformity itself Genomic Data OF Chest Wall Deformities Inheritance Patterns: Non-syndromic isolated cases of PE and PC often show autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. Familial cases suggest a multifactorial inheritance pattern with low recurrence risk. Syndromic cases are linked to well-characterized genetic mutations. Genetic Syndromes Associated: Marfan Syndrome: Caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, affecting connective tissue and frequently associated with PE or PC. Noonan Syndrome: Often caused by mutations in genes of the RAS/MAPK pathway, including PTPN11 and SOS1. These mutations are linked to thoracic deformities, pulmonary stenosis, and short stature. Turner Syndrome: Chromosomal disorder frequently associated with chest wall deformities. Other syndromes include DiGeorge syndrome and various chromosomal abnormalities. Molecular Findings: Mutations in PTPN11 (a non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase) are common in Noonan syndrome cases with chest wall deformities. SOS1 gene variants are also implicated, affecting signal transduction pathways. Incidental findings in genes like CACNA1C (associated with cardiac syndromes) have been reported in patients with chest wall deformities. Prevalence in Syndromic vs. Isolated Cases: Approximately 40% of patients with chest wall deformities may have identifiable genetic abnormalities when syndromic features are present. Over 32 syndromes have been described with PE or PC as common features. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Chest Wall Deformities Doctor: \"Hello! I understand you have some concerns about your child\\'s chest shape. Can you tell me what you’ve noticed?\" Parent: \"Yes, I’ve noticed that my child’s chest looks sunken in the middle, and sometimes they seem to have trouble breathing during exercise. I’m worried it might be something serious.\" Doctor: \"Thank you for sharing that. Based on what you describe, your child may have a condition called pectus excavatum, which is the most common chest wall deformity where the breastbone is sunken inward.\" Parent: \"Is this dangerous? Will it get worse?\" Doctor: \"In many cases, pectus excavatum is primarily a cosmetic issue and doesn’t cause serious health problems. However, in some children, especially if the deformity is moderate or severe, it can affect lung and heart function, leading to symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain.\" Parent: \"How do you confirm the diagnosis?\" Doctor: \"We usually start with a physical exam and then order imaging, like a chest X-ray or CT scan, to measure the severity. We also might do lung function tests and an echocardiogram to see if the heart is affected.\" Parent: \"What treatments are available?\" Doctor: \"Treatment depends on severity. For mild cases, we often monitor without intervention. For pectus carinatum, which is a protruding chest, we sometimes use bracing to reshape the chest wall. For moderate to severe pectus excavatum, surgery is an option. The most common surgery now is the Nuss procedure, which is minimally invasive and involves placing a metal bar to lift the sternum.\" Parent: \"What about risks from surgery?\" Doctor: \"Like any surgery, there are risks such as pain, infection, or complications like pneumothorax (air in the chest cavity). But these are relatively uncommon, and most children recover well with improved chest appearance and function.\" Parent: \"Is this condition hereditary? Should I be worried about other family members?\" Doctor: \"Chest wall deformities can run in families, so it’s worth checking siblings or other children for similar signs. We can offer screening if you’re concerned.\" Parent: \"Thank you. What should I watch for at home?\" Doctor: \"Keep an eye on your child’s breathing, exercise tolerance, and any chest pain. If symptoms worsen or if you notice difficulty feeding or blue discoloration, seek immediate care. Otherwise, we’ll schedule regular follow-ups to monitor progress.\" REFERENCES https://www.clevelandclinicabudhabi.ae/en/health-hub/health-resource/diseases-and-conditions/chest-wall-deformities https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/johns-hopkins-childrens-center/what-we-treat/specialties/pediatric-surgery-center/center-for-chest-wall-deformities/diagnosis-and-treatment https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553073/#article-19392.s9 https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/906078-overview AIRWAY MALACIA Alternative Names: Laryngomalacia (when involving the larynx) Tracheomalacia (when involving the trachea) Bronchomalacia (when involving the bronchi) Congenital airway malacia Floppy airway syndrome Dynamic airway collapse Soft airway syndrome Airway cartilage weakness Supraglottic collapse (specific to laryngomalacia) DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF AIRWAY MALACIA tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) Tracheobronchomalacia (TRAY-key-oh-bronco-mă-LAY-cia) is a condition where your trachea (windpipe) and your bronchi (the tubes that lead from your trachea to your lungs) are so weak that they collapse and close down when you take a breath or cough. If you have TBM, you may have issues breathing. You may wheeze or cough a lot. Some people are born with tracheobronchomalacia. This is primary or congenital TBM. But you can also develop it during your lifetime. Healthcare providers may call this secondary or acquired tracheobronchomalacia. Healthcare providers have treatments to help you manage tracheobronchomalacia symptoms. In some cases, they can do surgery to support your trachea and bronchi. Based on one study, experts estimate 1 in 2,100 babies are born with tracheobronchomalacia. In other research, experts estimate between 4% and 13% of people with airway problems have TBM. But that’s just an estimate, as providers don’t always make the connection between common respiratory problems and collapsing airways. causes tracheobronchomalacia Tracheobronchomalacia happens when the walls of your trachea and bronchi are weak and collapse when you take a breath. Your trachea is a stiff, flexible tube made of cartilage that carries air in and out of your lungs. Your bronchi move air into your lungs and are lined with tiny hair cells that help move mucus and particles out of your lungs. Causes of primary/congenital TBM Primary/congenital tracheobronchomalacia in babies may happen for no known reason (idiopathic TBM). But it may happen if they’re born with conditions, including: Vascular rings: Your baby may have a vascular ring because their aorta didn’t form normally during fetal development. The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygenated blood away from your baby’s heart to the rest of their body. If your baby has a vascular ring, their aorta wraps around their trachea to cause tracheobronchomalacia. Certain inherited disorders: Hunter syndrome, Hurler syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are inherited disorders that may cause tracheobronchomalacia. Premature birth: Babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy may have an increased risk of TBM if their trachea isn’t fully formed. Causes of secondary/acquired TBM Several things may cause secondary/acquired tracheo bronchomalacia including: Certain medical conditions. Certain treatments. Exposure to certain toxins. Medical conditions Adults with tracheo bronchomalacia often have the following conditions that can lead to TBM: Asthma. Bronchitis. Obesity. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Studies show nearly half of people treated for GERD have TBM. Goiters. This is an enlargement on your thyroid, which wraps around your trachea. Goiters can put pressure on your trachea. Relapsing polychondritis. This is a rare degenerative disease that causes your cartilage to deteriorate. Medical treatments Some medical treatments may cause tracheobronchomalacia: Prolonged tracheostomy use. A tracheostomy is a medical treatment to help you breathe by inserting a tube into your trachea. Prolonged use of inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids can treat asthma. Prolonged use of intubation and ventilation that injures your airway. Exposure to toxins Exposure to the following toxins may increase your risk of TBM: Toxic gases such as mustard gas. Secondhand smoke. symptoms of tracheobronchomalacia Symptoms may be different depending on whether you’re born with the condition or develop it over time. Babies born with TBM may have symptoms that start when they’re 2 to 4 months old. Symptoms may include: Stridor. Having a hard time breathing when you breastfeed or bottle feed them. Persistent cough. Frequent colds. Frequent respiratory tract infections. Tracheomalacia symptoms in adults may develop over time and get progressively worse. Symptoms include: Difficulty breathing after everyday activities like climbing stairs or walking. “Barking” or dry, harsh cough. Temporarily losing consciousness during coughing. Wheezing. Difficulty coughing up mucus. Frequent colds. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Diagnosis and Tests OF AIRWAY MALACIA A healthcare provider will do a physical examination. If they’re treating your child, they’ll ask you about their symptoms, their overall health and any medical conditions that may be the reason why your child is coughing, wheezing or has trouble breathing. If you’re having symptoms, your provider will do a physical examination and ask the same sorts of questions. They may ask if you have frequent respiratory infections or other conditions that affect how you breathe. They may do the following tests: Pulmonary function tests: These are tests to see how well air moves in and out of your lungs. Bronchoscopy: In this test, your provider checks how narrow your trachea becomes when you take a deep breath or cough. Computed tomography (CT) scan: Your provider may order this test to make sure other conditions aren’t causing your symptoms. Management and Treatment OF AIRWAY MALACIA Treatments vary depending on how tracheobronchomalacia affects your or your baby’s ability to breathe. For example: Your baby’s healthcare provider may prescribe antibiotics to treat any underlying infections. They may show you ways to breastfeed or bottle feed your baby that don’t affect their ability to breathe. They may prescribe medications to help manage your baby’s symptoms. They may prescribe pulmonary rehabilitation programs that teach you or your child ways to manage symptoms. You may use supportive devices that help you breathe. You or your child may need surgery to support weakened tracheas. Supportive devices for TBM treatment Several kinds of supportive devices or durable medical equipment treat TBM symptoms. These devices can help you or your child manage symptoms and limit how much tracheobronchomalacia affects your quality of life. Treatments include: CPAP or BiPAP® machines: These machines help to keep your trachea open. External percussion vests: TBM can make it hard to cough up mucus. External percussion vests connect to a machine that vibrates very fast, shaking up mucus in your bronchi so you can cough up mucus more easily. Nebulizer: Nebulizers change liquid medication into fine droplets that you or your child inhale through a mask or mouthpiece. Surgery for tracheobronchomalacia There are several surgical treatments for TBM. They include: Bronchoscopy: This is the same procedure that healthcare providers use to diagnose issues with your lungs or airway. In treatment, healthcare providers use a rigid bronchoscope to place a temporary stent in your airway. A stent is a small plastic, rubber or metal tube that holds your airway open. Stents help healthcare providers decide if you need additional surgery. Tracheobronchoplasty: This procedure involves sewing mesh to the outside of your trachea. The mesh gives your trachea more structure so it’s less likely to collapse. Tracheopexy: This is surgery that attaches the back of your trachea to ligaments in your spine to keep your trachea from collapsing. Complications of TBM surgery Tracheobronchoplasty and tracheopexy are major surgeries. Like most surgeries, there may be complications, including: Excessive bleeding. Blood clots. Infection of the surgical site. If your healthcare provider recommends surgery to treat TBM, they’ll explain the risk of complications. Outlook / Prognosis OF AIRWAY MALACIA Your child’s trachea cartilage will become stiffer as they grow up. That means there’s less chance that their trachea and bronchi will collapse and affect their breathing. But often, children with TBM need ongoing medical treatment and support to help them breathe. Sometimes, losing weight or treatment may help with TBM symptoms. But TBM in adults is often a chronic (continuing) condition. If you have tracheobronchomalacia, you’ll probably work with a healthcare provider who specializes in airway treatment for the rest of your life. Studies suggest that surgery helps ease tracheobronchomalacia symptoms right away and for several years after surgery. If you’re like many people with tracheobronchomalacia, you have other medical conditions that affect your overall health. Those conditions can make it more difficult for you to respond to treatment or recover from surgery. What is the life expectancy for people with tracheobronchomalacia? People who develop TBM often have other serious medical conditions that may affect their life expectancy. Your healthcare provider is your best source if you want to know if having tracheobronchomalacia could affect how long you’ll live. Does tracheobronchomalacia go away? TBM in adults can be life-threatening because it doesn’t go away and gets worse over time. TBM in babies may cause less serious symptoms as they grow up. Prevention OF AIRWAY MALACIA There’s no way to prevent congenital tracheobronchomalacia in children. Adults can develop TBM over time if they have certain medical conditions or have exposure to secondhand smoke or toxic gases. Tracheobronchomalacia gets worse over time, so talk to a healthcare provider if you know you have exposure to secondhand smoke, toxic gases or conditions that may increase your risk. You may not be able to keep TBM from happening, but there may be ways to keep it from getting worse. Living With Most children with tracheobronchomalacia will need medical support throughout childhood. For example, you or your child will need treatment like taking medications or using devices that keep your airway clear. Your child’s pediatrician may schedule regular follow-up appointments to check on your child’s overall health. You may want to ask your child’s pediatrician about ways to protect your child’s overall health, like ways to avoid respiratory infections. If you have tracheobronchomalacia, here are some suggestions that may be helpful: Take care of your health: Many people with TBM also have asthma, COPD or bronchitis. If you do, be sure to follow your treatment plan and your provider’s advice for managing your underlying illness. Eat well: Having obesity can make it hard for you to breathe. Getting to or maintaining a weight that’s right for you may help ease breathing issues that TBM can cause. Get some regular physical activity: Regular activity may help you manage your weight. Avoid secondhand smoke: Studies suggest secondhand smoke exposure increases your risk of developing TBM. When should I see my healthcare provider? If you have TBM, you’ll have ongoing medical care and regular medical checkups. Contact your provider if you notice your symptoms like coughing or wheezing get worse. Differential Diagnoses for Airway Malacia Laryngomalacia Tracheomalacia Bronchomalacia Subglottic stenosis (congenital or acquired narrowing below vocal cords) Vocal cord paralysis (unilateral or bilateral) Congenital cysts or laryngeal masses (e.g., laryngeal cysts) Tracheal or bronchial stenosis (fixed airway narrowing due to scarring or congenital anomaly) Vascular rings or slings (vascular anomalies compressing the airway externally) Foreign body aspiration (acute airway obstruction) Hypocalcemic tetany (laryngospasm due to low calcium) Infectious causes (e.g., croup, bacterial tracheitis causing airway inflammation) Asthma or reactive airway disease (wheezing without dynamic airway collapse) Excessive dynamic airway collapse (EDAC) (posterior membrane bowing without cartilage weakness) Epidemiology of Airway Malacia Prevalence: Airway malacia, including tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia, is relatively rare but not uncommon in pediatric populations undergoing airway evaluation. In a study of 512 bronchoscopies, airway malacia was diagnosed in approximately 31% (160 children), with a median age of 4 years (range 0–17 years). Incidence: The estimated incidence of primary airway malacia is at least 1 in 2,100 children. Sex Distribution: Males appear to be more frequently affected; in one cohort, 94 out of 160 diagnosed children were males. Age at Diagnosis: Median age at diagnosis is around 4 years, but airway malacia can present from infancy through childhood. Associated Conditions: Up to 30% of children with airway malacia have congenital syndromes or anomalies such as esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF), cardiovascular anomalies, or primary ciliary dyskinesia. Types: Airway malacia can be congenital (primary) or acquired (secondary), with congenital forms often improving spontaneously by 18–24 months of age. Clinical Impact: Symptoms include stridor, recurrent respiratory infections, cough, and exercise intolerance. Severity and symptom persistence vary depending on the type and extent of Malacia PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON AIRWAY MALACIA Q1. What is airway Malacia? Answer: Airway Malacia refers to abnormal softness or floppiness of the airway walls, leading to dynamic collapse during breathing. It includes laryngomalacia (upper airway), tracheomalacia (trachea), and bronchomalacia (bronchi). Q2. What are the common symptoms of airway Malacia in children? Answer: Symptoms often include noisy breathing (stridor or wheezing), persistent cough, recurrent respiratory infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis, episodes of respiratory distress, and sometimes cyanosis or difficulty feeding. Wheezing and cough are common, with cough present in over 98% of cases and wheezing in about 67%. Q3. How is airway malacia diagnosed? Answer: Diagnosis is primarily by flexible bronchoscopy, which allows direct visualization of airway collapse during breathing. Imaging such as dynamic CT scans can assist. Clinical suspicion arises when children have persistent noisy breathing or recurrent respiratory infections not explained by other causes. Q4. What infections are commonly associated with airway malacia? Answer: Children with airway malacia complicated by pneumonia often have infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Q5. What are the risk factors or associated conditions for airway malacia? Answer: Premature birth, history of mechanical ventilation, and congenital anomalies such as esophageal atresia or cardiovascular malformations increase the risk. Children with airway malacia often have longer hospital stays and more severe respiratory symptoms. Q6. How is airway malacia managed? Answer: Management is mostly supportive, including treatment of infections, respiratory support if needed, and monitoring. Severe cases may require surgical intervention or airway stabilization. Avoidance of irritants and treatment of associated conditions like gastroesophageal reflux may help. Q7. What is Excessive Dynamic Airway Collapse (EDAC) and how is it related to airway malacia? Answer: EDAC is a related condition characterized by excessive bulging of the posterior airway membrane during exhalation without cartilage weakness. It can coexist with or mimic airway malacia and may require specialized evaluation and management. Q8. Can airway malacia improve over time? Answer: Yes, many cases of congenital airway malacia improve spontaneously as the airway cartilage strengthens, often by 18-24 months of age, though some cases may persist or require intervention DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON AIRWAY MALACIA Doctor: \"Hello, I understand you\\'ve been experiencing some breathing difficulties. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\" Patient: \"Yes, I often feel like I’m short of breath, especially when I exercise or cough. Sometimes I even have episodes where I gasp for air. It’s been going on for years, and I was told it might be asthma, but the medications don’t seem to help much.\" Doctor: \"Based on what you’re describing, one possibility is a condition called airway malacia. This means that parts of your airway, like your windpipe or the tubes leading to your lungs, are softer than normal and tend to collapse when you breathe out or cough.\" Patient: \"I’ve never heard of that before. How does it happen?\" Doctor: \"It can be something you’re born with, called congenital airway malacia, or it can develop later due to injury, inflammation, or other conditions. The cartilage that normally keeps your airway open is weak or floppy, so the airway narrows or collapses, making it harder to breathe.\" Patient: \"How do you diagnose this?\" Doctor: \"We usually start with imaging tests like a CT scan, especially a dynamic CT that takes pictures while you breathe in and out. The most definitive test is a bronchoscopy, where we use a thin camera to look directly inside your airway while you breathe. This helps us see if and where your airway is collapsing.\" Patient: \"Is there treatment for this? Can it be fixed?\" Doctor: \"Yes, treatment depends on the severity. Mild cases can be managed with supportive care and physiotherapy to help clear mucus and improve breathing. For more severe cases, there is a surgical option called tracheobronchoplasty, where a mesh is placed to support the airway and prevent collapse. This surgery has helped many patients return to normal activities.\" Patient: \"Are there risks with surgery?\" Doctor: \"Like any surgery, there are risks such as infection or complications from anesthesia, but it’s generally safe when done by experienced surgeons. We carefully evaluate each patient to decide the best approach.\" Patient: \"What should I do now?\" Doctor: \"We’ll arrange the necessary tests to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity. Meanwhile, if you experience worsening breathing difficulty, persistent cough, or infections, please seek medical attention promptly. We’ll work together to develop a treatment plan tailored for you.\" REFERENCES Tracheobronchomalacia: Symptoms, Causes & Treatment Tracheal stenosis Common Alternative Names: Tracheal narrowing Tracheal stricture Subglottic stenosis (when narrowing is just below the vocal cords) Laryngotracheal stenosis (when both larynx and trachea are involved) Tracheal obstruction Congenital tracheal stenosis (if present from birth) Acquired tracheal stenosis (if due to injury, infection, or intubation) Tracheal web or membrane (if caused by thin tissue bands causing narrowing) DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Tracheal stenosis Tracheal stenosis involves narrowing of your trachea (windpipe) that makes it harder to breathe. Your trachea is a tube made of cartilage and soft tissue. Air travels through your trachea on the way from your nose and mouth to your lungs. When you have tracheal stenosis, inflammation, injury or scar tissue in your trachea makes it harder for air to flow through. “Stenosis” is the medical term for atypical narrowing in a body passage. It can develop in different parts of your throat. For example, a related condition called laryngotracheal stenosis involves narrowing in both your trachea and larynx (voice box). Subglottic stenosis is narrowing in the area above your trachea and below your vocal cords. Regardless of the part of your throat that’s affected, you should contact a healthcare provider if you’re having difficulty breathing. Types There are two types of tracheal stenosis: Acquired tracheal stenosis is acquired (developed) during your lifetime because of an injury or illness. The most common type, it affects both adults and children. Congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) is present at birth. A rare and potentially fatal condition, it affects 1 out of every 64,500 babies. Most are diagnosed at birth or within the first few months of being born. Tracheal stenosis is life-threatening in infants. Seek emergency care if your newborn is showing signs of tracheal stenosis, like struggling for air. That said, both forms of tracheal stenosis make it harder to breathe, which can affect your quality of life. That’s why seeing a healthcare provider is so important if you or your child has this condition. causes tracheal stenosis With congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS), the cartilage that makes up an infant’s trachea doesn’t form correctly, causing their windpipe to be too narrow. Long-term intubation is the most common cause of acquired tracheal stenosis. Intubation is a lifesaving treatment that involves inserting a tube into your trachea so you can breathe. Sometimes, intubation causes damage that leads to stenosis. Children may develop tracheal stenosis if they were born with premature lungs and their provider used breathing tubes to help them get air. You might also develop tracheal stenosis if you: Have an autoimmune disorder, like granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) Have an inflammatory condition, like pulmonary sarcoidosis Have an infectious disease, like tuberculosis, or other bacterial and viral infections that affect your respiratory system Have a benign or malignant tumor pressing on your trachea Inhaled a substance that damaged your trachea, including chemicals or poisonous gases Had radiation therapy directed toward your neck or chest Had a tracheostomy (emergency surgery that creates a hole in your trachea so that you can breathe) symptoms of tracheal stenosis Many tracheal stenosis symptoms are the same for children and adults. Common symptoms include: Difficulty breathing after everyday activities like climbing stairs or walking Stridor (sounds like a wheeze or whistle when you breathe both in and out) Persistent cough Difficulty coughing up phlegm Frequent colds, bouts of pneumonia or other respiratory infections Persistent asthma that isn’t better after treatment Chest congestion Gaps in breathing (apnea) and sleep apnea Children are more likely to have additional symptoms: Infants might have difficulty breastfeeding or bottle feeding. They might also seem unusually tired after feeding. Older children might choke or have difficulty breathing while they eat. Older children’s skin around their noses and their gums might appear blue (cyanosis) Diagnosis and Tests OF Tracheal stenosis Otolaryngologists (ENTs) use several tests to diagnose tracheal stenosis and decide how to treat it. Tests may include: Endoscopic procedures. Bronchoscopy is the primary procedure for diagnosing tracheal stenosis. Your healthcare provider may also perform a laryngoscopy. Imaging procedures. A computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest and neck is the most common imaging procedure that shows tracheal stenosis. Sometimes, healthcare providers recommend magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to help plan treatment. Pulmonary function test. Providers will ask you to complete several breathing tests. This helps them check things like how your trachea size and lung function affect your breathing. You may need other tests to check for what’s causing your condition. Tests may include a blood test to check for inflammation or infection or a biopsy to see if unusual growths in your airway are cancerous. Management and Treatment OF Tracheal stenosis Surgeries and procedures that widen your trachea are the most common treatments for tracheal stenosis. Treatment options include: Tracheal dilation. Healthcare providers place a balloon or tracheal dilator in your trachea. The balloon or dilator stretches your trachea so that you can breathe. Laser bronchoscopy. Providers direct a laser beam at scar tissue in your trachea. The laser burns away the tissue, opening up your airways. Trachea airway stent. A provider places a small, plastic or metal tube called a stent that holds your trachea open. (Stenting may or may not be an option, depending on the location of the stenosis.) Tracheal resection and reconstruction. A provider cuts away (resects) the tissue that’s causing the narrowing. Then, they join the two remaining ends of your trachea together. This procedure reconstructs your trachea to create an unobstructed airway. The best treatment for tracheal stenosis depends on lots of things, including where the narrowing is and how severe it is. Your provider will explain how these factors inform which procedures will work best for you. Outlook / Prognosis OF Tracheal stenosis You’ll likely need surgery or a nonsurgical procedure if you have tracheal stenosis. Each treatment option has different recovery times and outcomes. For example, tracheal resection and reconstruction surgeries are invasive. But they’re more likely to eliminate the narrowing in your trachea in the long term. Nonsurgical procedures, like tracheal dilation, are less invasive. They may be the only treatment you need, or you may repeat procedures. Regardless of the procedure, your healthcare provider will monitor you to check for recurrence. Tracheal stenosis sometimes comes back because treatment can cause new scar tissue to form. Your provider will explain how likely it is that your condition will return. Living With Tracheal stenosis You might start by asking your healthcare provider how your surgery will affect you. Every procedure to treat tracheal stenosis will require different at-home care. Your healthcare provider will have information about your next steps. They may advise you on: What you can eat. For the first 24 hours, you may need to stick with soft foods that are easy to swallow. It may be a good idea to limit yourself to bland foods that won’t upset your stomach. How you should sleep.? For the first few days, you may need to keep your upper body elevated as you try to sleep. How to manage pain.? Your provider can recommend over-the-counter (OTC) medications or prescribe pain medicines as needed. How active you should be.? You may have activity restrictions for the first week or so following surgery. When should I see my healthcare provider? Your healthcare provider will schedule follow-up appointments to check on your recovery after treatment. At first, you may need to see your provider every few weeks or so. If you’re healing well, your provider may extend follow-up visits to every few months until they’re confident the stenosis won’t return. Contact your provider anytime you’re experiencing shortness of breath. While next steps vary depending on your condition, it can be dangerous to put off getting help when you’re having difficulty breathing. It’s essential to seek care. You should go to the emergency room if you can’t breathe or have other tracheal stenosis symptoms. The symptoms might be a sign your tracheal stenosis has come back. If you’re caring for a newborn or infant who’s having difficulty breathing, get them to an emergency room immediately. Differential Diagnosis of Tracheal Stenosis Tracheomalacia (softening and collapse of the tracheal walls) Laryngomalacia (supraglottic airway collapse) Subglottic stenosis (narrowing just below the vocal cords, congenital or acquired) Vocal cord paralysis (unilateral or bilateral causing airway obstruction) Congenital cysts or laryngeal masses (e.g., laryngeal cysts causing narrowing) Foreign body aspiration (causing acute airway obstruction) Hypocalcemic tetany (laryngospasm due to low calcium) Infectious causes (e.g., bacterial tracheitis, epiglottitis causing airway swelling) Vascular rings or slings (external vascular compression of the trachea) Granulomatous diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis, Wegener’s granulomatosis causing airway inflammation and stenosis) Trauma-related stenosis (post-intubation injury, surgery, or blunt trauma causing scarring) Neoplastic lesions (benign or malignant tumors causing airway narrowing) Autoimmune disorders (e.g., relapsing polychondritis affecting airway cartilage) Asthma or reactive airway disease (may mimic symptoms but no fixed airway narrowing) Epidemiology of Tracheal Stenosis Incidence: Overall incidence of tracheal stenosis following tracheostomy or intubation ranges widely from 0.6% to 31% depending on the population and diagnostic methods used. Symptomatic tracheal stenosis occurs in about 6% of patients after tracheostomy. Post-tracheotomy or post-intubation stenosis incidence is reported between 0.6% and 21%. In ICU patients, tracheal stenosis after prolonged intubation or tracheostomy is a significant complication. Risk Factors: Prolonged intubation or delayed tracheostomy increases the risk. Airway trauma from endotracheal tubes, poor cuff pressure control, infection, and surgical technique influence development. Systemic factors like cardiovascular disease and metabolic conditions may contribute. COVID-19 patients, especially those with prolonged ventilation, have increased tracheal stenosis incidence. Demographics: Can affect all ages but often seen in adults after prolonged mechanical ventilation. Some studies report a higher prevalence in males. Median age varies but often includes middle-aged adults. Clinical Burden: Tracheal stenosis leads to respiratory distress, impaired quality of life, and may be life-threatening if severe. It accounts for a significant proportion of tracheostomy-related complications and hospital readmissions. Mortality rates vary; some studies report in-hospital mortality around 3-23% in severe cases. Common Causes: The most common cause is prolonged endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy (up to 85% in some cohorts). Other causes include tumors, infections (e.g., tuberculosis), trauma, autoimmune diseases, and congenital abnormalities. Key Genetic Findings OF Tracheal stenosis TBX5 gene mutations: A de novo pathogenic variant in the TBX5 gene (e.g., p.Ile227Thr) has been identified in patients with congenital tracheal stenosis combined with congenital heart defects. TBX5 is a transcription factor critical for embryonic development, including tracheal cartilage formation. Mutations can reduce protein stability and disrupt normal tracheal development. Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) Pathway: Mutations or dysregulation in FGFR2 and FGF10 genes are implicated in tracheal stenosis. Overexpression of FGF10 and its regulators (e.g., TBX4, TBX5) leads to abnormal proliferation of tracheal mesenchyme and excessive cartilage formation, contributing to stenosis. Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) Signaling: SHH pathway is essential for tracheal chondrogenesis. Loss of SHH function disrupts expression of downstream genes like BMP4 and SOX9, impairing cartilage development and causing tracheal malformations. GLI3 mutations: Associated with syndromes such as Pallister-Hall syndrome, GLI3 mutations can cause tracheal stenosis as part of broader congenital malformations. Genetic predisposition to acquired tracheal stenosis: Recent research suggests that genetic variants affecting wound healing and scarring pathways may predispose certain ethnic groups (e.g., African Americans) to acquired laryngotracheal stenosis after intubation or tracheostomy. Congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS): Characterized by complete tracheal rings without a membranous portion, CTS is a rare but life-threatening condition with a strong genetic basis involving the genes mentioned above Treatment of Tracheal Stenosis: Drug Information and Side Effects 1. Medical (Drug) Treatments Corticosteroids (Anti-inflammatory drugs): Used to reduce airway inflammation and prevent progression of stenosis, either systemically (oral or intravenous) or by inhalation. Side effects: Oral/IV steroids: Immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, weight gain, osteoporosis, adrenal suppression, mood changes. Inhaled steroids: Oral thrush, hoarseness, cough. Other supportive medications: Antibiotics if infection is present. Bronchodilators may be used symptomatically but do not treat stenosis itself. 2. Endoscopic (Non-Surgical) Procedures Tracheal dilation: Balloon or mechanical dilators widen the narrowed tracheal segment. Provides temporary relief. May require repeated procedures due to restenosis. Laser bronchoscopy: Laser ablation removes scar tissue causing narrowing. Usually temporary relief; can sometimes worsen stenosis if not carefully applied. Cryotherapy: Freezing abnormal tissue to reduce size and improve airway patency. Minimally invasive. Photodynamic therapy: Uses light-sensitive drugs and laser to destroy abnormal cells. Experimental but promising. Tracheobronchial stenting: Placement of silicone or metal stents to keep airway open, used in inoperable cases or as a bridge to surgery. Side effects: Granulation tissue formation, stent migration, infection, mucous plugging. 3. Surgical Treatment Tracheal resection and reconstruction: Removal of stenotic segment and rejoining healthy ends. Considered the definitive treatment with the highest cure rates (~95%). Requires good overall patient health and suitable stenosis characteristics. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Tracheal stenosis Q1. Why did I develop tracheal stenosis? A. Tracheal stenosis often develops due to injury or irritation to the tracheal lining, most commonly from prolonged intubation or tracheostomy. Factors such as pressure from the breathing tube cuff, airway trauma during insertion, infections, poor cuff pressure management, and underlying conditions like diabetes or cardiovascular disease can contribute to damage and scarring that narrows the airway. Other causes include autoimmune diseases, tumors, radiation therapy, or congenital abnormalities, but the majority of acquired cases relate to airway instrumentation and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Q2. Will I need surgery? A. Whether you need surgery depends on the severity, location, and cause of your tracheal stenosis, as well as your overall health. Mild cases may be managed conservatively or with endoscopic procedures like dilation or laser therapy. However, surgical resection and reconstruction of the narrowed tracheal segment is often the definitive treatment for significant or symptomatic stenosis that impairs breathing. Q3. What are the typical side effects of surgery to treat tracheal stenosis? A. Surgery carries risks such as: Bleeding Infection Airway swelling or restenosis (re-narrowing) Anastomotic complications (problems at the site where the trachea is reconnected) General risks of anesthesia Most patients recover well with careful surgical technique and postoperative care, but close follow-up is essential to monitor for complications. Q4. How likely is it that my tracheal stenosis will come back after surgery? A. The chance of recurrence varies but is generally low with successful surgical resection, reported cure rates can be as high as 95%. However, restenosis can occur, especially if underlying risk factors persist or if the surgery is incomplete. Factors like ongoing inflammation, infection, or poor healing increase the risk of recurrence. Q5. How can I care for myself during recovery? A. Follow all postoperative instructions carefully, including wound care and activity restrictions. Attend all follow-up appointments for airway evaluation and monitoring. Avoid respiratory infections by practicing good hygiene and getting vaccinations. Manage underlying conditions such as diabetes or reflux that may affect healing. Report any new or worsening symptoms such as difficulty breathing, coughing, or noisy breathing promptly. Avoid smoking and irritants that can worsen airway inflammation Doctor-patient conversation about tracheal stenosis Doctor: \"Hello, I want to discuss the results of your recent evaluation. You have a condition called tracheal stenosis, which means there is a narrowing in your windpipe that’s making it harder for you to breathe.\" Patient: \"What causes this narrowing? Did I do something wrong?\" Doctor: \"Not at all. The most common cause is injury or irritation from previous intubation or a tracheostomy tube, especially if it was in place for a long time. Other causes include infections, inflammation, or sometimes congenital issues. It’s not your fault, and we have ways to manage it.\" Patient: \"Will I need surgery to fix this?\" Doctor: \"That depends on how severe the narrowing is and how much it’s affecting your breathing. Mild cases might be managed with less invasive procedures like balloon dilation or laser treatment. But if the narrowing is significant, surgery to remove the narrowed segment and reconnect the healthy parts of your trachea is usually the best option.\" Patient: \"What are the risks if I have surgery?\" Doctor: \"Like any surgery, there are risks such as bleeding, infection, or the airway narrowing again after surgery. We monitor patients closely after surgery to catch any issues early. Most people recover well and have significant improvement in breathing.\" Patient: \"How will I communicate if I have a tracheostomy or after surgery?\" Doctor: \"If you have a tracheostomy tube, we can use special speaking valves that allow air to pass through your vocal cords so you can talk. Speech therapists will work with you to help optimize your voice and breathing. We also ensure you have alternative communication methods if needed.\" Patient: \"What should I expect during recovery?\" Doctor: \"Recovery involves careful monitoring of your airway, managing any infections, and attending follow-up appointments. You’ll need to avoid irritants like smoking and practice good hygiene. Our team, including speech therapists and physiotherapists, will support you throughout the process.\" Patient: \"Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening again?\" Doctor: \"We recommend avoiding prolonged intubation if possible, ensuring proper care of any airway tubes, and managing any underlying health issues. If you have symptoms like difficulty breathing or noisy breathing in the future, seek medical attention early.\" REFERENCES Tracheal Stenosis: Symptoms, Causes & Treatment https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/12008/congenital-tracheal-stenosis Interstitial lung disease DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Interstitial lung disease The term ‘interstitial lung disease’ covers a large group of lung conditions that affect the interstitium, the tissue and space around the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs. This is where oxygen is taken into the body and carbon dioxide is taken out of the body. These conditions can affect the lungs in different ways. Most of the time, the walls of the interstitium get thicker, which makes it harder for the lungs to expand (when breathing in) or contract (when breathing out). This can lead to lower levels of oxygen in the blood and may make a child short of breath. To make up for this they will often breathe faster, which uses up more energy and makes them very tired. ChILD also includes some conditions whose effects are more widespread in the lungs and are not just focused on the interstitium. These are called diffuse lung diseases. The symptoms and effects on the body are usually the same, which is why they are known as ChILD conditions. ChILD conditions are linked to a range of potential causes, including the genes a child inherits from their parents, having problems with the immune system, being exposed to air pollution, and going through chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Causes OF Interstitial lung disease ChILD can crop up without a known cause. On the other hand, certain genes, toxins, or other diseases may be culprits. Some possible causes are: Inherited conditions: Disorders that cause problems with surfactant -- a fluid in the lungs that helps your child breathe -- can be passed on through genes. Immune system disorders: Certain immune system problems make it harder for kids to fight off illnesses. Autoimmune diseases: These happen when your child’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues. Inflammatory bowel disease and collagen vascular disease are two autoimmune conditions commonly linked to chILD. Infection: Some children get chILD after a cold or virus. Birth defects: Babies can be born with a birth defect that causes problems with their lungs. Aspiration: When you inhale food, liquid, or vomit into your lungs, damage can happen. Aspiration often affects kids with swallowing problems or a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Cancer treatments: Therapies, such as radiation and chemo, may lead to chILD. Environmental triggers: Chemicals and molds can irritate your child’s lungs. Surgeries: A lung transplant or bone marrow transplant may be to blame for certain cases of chILD. Types There are different kinds of chILD. Many have long, hard-to-pronounce names. Although they’re all considered rare diseases, some forms are more common in specific age groups. ChILD diseases that usually affect babies are: Surfactant dysfunction mutations Developmental disorders, such as alveolar capillary dysplasia Lung growth abnormalities Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI) Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (PIG) Types of chILD that are more common in children and teens are: Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias: This category includes cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. Other primary disorders: These disorders may be alveolar hemorrhage syndromes, aspiration syndromes, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans, eosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia, pulmonary lymphatic disorders (lymphangiomatosis, lymphangiectasis), or pulmonary vascular disorders (haemangiomatosis). ILD-associated with systemic disease processes: Examples are connective tissue diseases, histiocytosis, malignancy-related lung disease, sarcoidosis, and storage diseases. Disorders of the compromised immune system: This group includes opportunistic infection, disorders related to therapeutic intervention, lung and bone marrow transplant-associated lung diseases, and diffuse alveolar damage of unknown cause. Symptoms OF Interstitial lung disease Signs and symptoms of chILD often depend on the type of disease and how severe it is. They may include: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Fast or noisy breathing Wheezing Coughing or chest congestion Repeated bouts of pneumonia or bronchitis Low oxygen levels Failure to gain weight or grow in height Adults vs. Child Interstitial Disease Some kids who get chILD will have the condition throughout their lives, so it can technically happen in both children and adults. But when an adult is diagnosed with an interstitial lung disease, doctors usually consider it a completely different condition than chILD. Kids with chILD should see a pediatric pulmonologist, rather than a doctor who specializes in adults. Diagnosis OF Interstitial lung disease It’s often hard to diagnose chILD. Each type is different, so the methods your doctor uses will vary. Tests that help diagnose chILD include: Chest X-ray or CT scan: These imaging procedures use X-rays to take pictures of your child’s lungs. Lung function tests: Doctors measure how kids breathe in and out to examine how well their lungs work. Blood tests: Blood draws are sometimes used to check for abnormal genes. Bronchoalveolar lavage: With this procedure, a doctor injects salt water through a tube in your child’s lungs to see specific types of cells. It can help spot a lung injury, aspiration, infection, or an airway problem. Lung biopsy: A surgeon takes out a small piece of lung tissue to test in a lab. Treatment OF Interstitial lung disease Very little research has been done on how to treat chILD. But some therapies can help children’s lungs work better, ease symptoms, or simply make them feel better. Your doctor may recommend: Medicines: Steroids lower lung inflammation, antimicrobial drugs treat infections, and bronchodilators help relax muscles around the airways. Oxygen: More oxygen can help children breathe better and give their hearts a rest. Nutrition: An eating plan that focuses on weight gain may benefit some kids with chILD. Pulmonary rehab and exercises: Special therapies aim to ease congestion and improve how well the lungs work (your doctor may call this “lung function”). Breathing machines: Devices called ventilators can help children breathe easier. Lung transplant: This may be an option for kids with serious or life-threatening cases of chILD. So far, chILD doesn’t seem to come back in children who have the surgery. Outlook OF Interstitial lung disease With no cure for chILD, the condition comes about and advances differently in each child. Some cases are severe and tend to be life-threatening at an early age. Other types stay the same or worsen slowly. But certain forms of the disease, such as neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy, can even improve over time. Kids with chILD may have special needs. It’s a good idea to talk with teachers, family members, and other parents about ways to support your child and the rest of your family. Take good care of your own health, too. Caregivers often put themselves last, but you need to be well to help your family. Epidemiology OF Interstitial lung disease Overall, ILD is rare in children, and individual ILDs are extremely rare. Because of the different approaches to case ascertainment and definition, determining the incidence and prevalence of ILDs is difficult. In a systematic review of the literature, the incidence of chILD was estimated at 0.13-16.2 cases per 100,000 children per year. United States data Most of the literature is composed of case reports and small series. One of the first relatively large series was a combined retrospective and prospective study by Fan et al performed over a 15-year period at a leading referral center for ILD. The study included 99 patients, in whom the case definition included respiratory symptoms lasting longer than 1 month, diffuse infiltrates depicted on chest radiography, and the absence of known bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), heart disease, malignancy, immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, cystic fibrosis (CF), aspiration, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A retrospective study that attempted a relatively complete case ascertainment of children undergoing biopsy for ILD in 11 referral centers in the United States and Canada over a 5-year period reported 187 cases in children younger than 2 years old. Fan et al expanded this case ascertainment in a study of children aged 2-18 years undergoing lung biopsies over a 4-year period at 12 centers across North America; the completed study reported 191 cases of chILD. In a single-center study, chILD cases were retrospectively reviewed and classified according to the classification system used by Fan et al; 93 cases were identified and 91% were classifiable. The National Registry for Childhood Interstitial and Diffuse Lung Diseases was created in the United States to improve the understanding of chILDs. The prospective registry enrolled 683 patients with various diagnoses from centers across the United States; the most common diagnosis was NEHI (23% of patients). International data A national survey of cases of chronic ILD in immunocompetent children aged 0-16 years in the United Kingdom and Ireland over a 3-year period yielded an estimated prevalence of 3.6 per million. Griese et al used data from the Surveillance Unit for Rare Paediatric Disorders to determine that the incidence of chILD in Germany is 1.32 new cases per 1 million children per year. In Europe, an international registry enrolled 575 patients over a 3-year period; the distribution of some of the diagnostic categories was as follows : Diffuse developmental disorders, 2.6% Growth abnormalities, 6.4% Other diagnoses in infancy (eg, NEHI, PIG), 18.5% Surfactant dysfunction, 22.3% Respiratory distress syndrome in a mature or almost mature neonate, 4% Diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) related to systemic disease, 15.6% Exposure-related DPLD in an immune intact host, 13.3% DPLD in an immunocompromised host, 4.3% DPLD related to lung vessels, 4.6%; reactive lymphoid lesions, 1.2%; and airway disorders, 3.5% A study from Australia and New Zealand of patients aged 0-18 years with a diagnosis of chILD gathered questionnaire data from clinical providers and data from reference genetics laboratories; the investigators calculated the prevalence at 1.5 cases per million. Sex- and age-related demographics There appears to be a slight male predominance (53-60%) in reported cases of chILD. This male predominance is found primarily in cohorts of children younger than 2 years; the male: female ratio is close to 50:50 in the diagnoses that cluster in the older ages. ILD can present at any age from birth to adulthood. Some diagnoses cluster in infancy, such as NEHI and PIG, while other forms of chILD present throughout childhood and adolescence. A lung biopsy review of 378 chILD cases in children aged 0-2 years versus those aged 2-18 years demonstrated significant differences in the distribution and spectrum of diseases based on age. A European task force described 185 cases of ILDs in immunocompetent children; they demonstrated a significant clustering of cases among children younger than 2 years. In an 18-year retrospective review of 93 cases identified at a single institution, the median age at diagnosis was 90 months Differential Diagnoses OF Interstitial lung disease Afebrile Pneumonia Syndrome Anti-GBM Antibody Disease Aspiration Syndromes Bone Marrow Transplantation Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Cystic Fibrosis Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener Granulomatosis) Hemosiderosis Histiocytosis Histoplasmosis Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Inhalation Injury Juvenile Systemic Sclerosis Long-Term Effects of Bone Marrow Transplantation Lymphoproliferative Disorders Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection Pediatric Anti-GBM Disease (Goodpasture Syndrome) Pediatric Sarcoidosis Pediatric Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD) Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection Staging OF Interstitial lung disease No widely used staging system is available for chILD, which is appropriate because the spectrum of possible diagnoses is large. In adults, a scoring system is available for IPF, based on clinical, radiographic, and pathologic findings (ie, CRP scoring system). Fan devised a simple scoring system for chILD. A score of 5 indicates the worst outcome, with a 38% survival rate at 60 months. A score of 2, 3, or 4 indicates a survival rate of 76%. Data from Cox proportional hazards modeling suggests a 140% increase in risk of death with each unit increase in score. The score can be applied to most ILD diagnoses with the likely exception of NEHI, which has a good eventual prognosis in the majority of cases. The Fan severity scoring system is as follows: Asymptomatic Symptomatic with normal oxyhemoglobin saturation Symptomatic with nocturnal or exercise-induced desaturation Desaturation at rest Pulmonary hypertension Procedures OF Interstitial lung disease Bronchoalveolar lavage Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is useful in diagnosing certain conditions in the differential diagnosis of ILD, including alveolar proteinosis, aspiration syndromes, pulmonary hemosiderosis, eosinophilic syndromes, and various infections. Occasionally, results of cytologic analysis may be diagnostic—for example, when Langerhans cells are present, indicating histiocytosis. Most authorities believe BAL should precede biopsy. Problems with the use of BAL include the lack of a standardized methodology in children, the paucity of reference values for differential cell counts, the variability of BAL findings at different times in a disease course, and the lack of correlation between BAL and histologic findings. Fluid should be sent for differential cell counts, cultures and special staining for bacteria (including mycobacteria) and fungi, cytologic analysis (including oil red O staining for lipid-laden macrophages and staining for hemosiderin), pepsin levels, and viral diagnostic studies. BAL findings can be diagnostic of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), demonstrating a cloudy or milky appearance of the fluid with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)–positive amorphous debris. Electron microscopy may reveal lamellar membranous structures in a fibrous and granular matrix with degenerative cells.Increased eosinophils (>30% of total) are consistent with eosinophilic pneumonia syndromes, whereas predominant lymphocytosis can be associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. CD1a-positive cells are diagnostic for Langerhans cell histiocytosis. A study evaluated quantitation of levels of surfactant proteins B (SP-B) and C (SP-C) in BAL fluid for the diagnosis of chILD and reported that low SP-C levels may suggest diseases caused by mutations in NKX2.1, SFTPC, ABCA3, and other genes involved in surfactant metabolism. SP-B levels may be used to screen for SP-B deficiency; however, given the availability of genetic testing, this approach is not the standard of care for diagnosis. Lung biopsy Analysis of tissue obtained during lung biopsy can be the best route to a diagnosis if it cannot be established by noninvasive means. For NEHI, an expert clinician can be confident of a presumptive diagnosis based on the clinical history and characteristic HRCT findings, but this is not true of most other chILD entities. An increasing number of chILDs can be diagnosed by genetic testing. Much of the classification of ILD, especially in disorders of unknown cause, is based on histopathology. However, it is important to note that a histopathologic pattern is not synonymous with a diagnosis in many cases. To maximize the diagnostic yield, a pediatric lung biopsy protocol has been developed and supported by the ChILD Research Network. However, a diagnosis is not reached in all patients, even after biopsy is performed. The number of biopsy procedures performed and the method used (eg, open vs thoracoscopic) have little influence on diagnostic yield. Diagnostic yield may be enhanced if HRCT is used to direct the biopsy sites. The biopsy sample should be taken from a region of involvement. If diffuse involvement is found, any site (except the tip of the right middle lobe or lingua) is appropriate. Communication between the clinician, surgeon, pathologist, and radiologist before the biopsy is useful and appropriate for determining biopsy sites and prioritizing use of the tissue. Compared with open lung biopsy, thoracoscopic biopsy shortens the surgical time, duration of chest tube placement, and hospital stay without substantially altering the diagnostic yield. The choice between thoracoscopic and open approaches should be left to the consulting surgeon. Transbronchial biopsies are not recommended for chILDs. Regardless of the method used, biopsy samples should be processed for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures and staining, including special staining, light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Immunostains, such as bombesin for NEHI and vimentin for pulmonary interstitial glycogenesis (PIG), may aid in the diagnosis of specific forms of ILD. Cardiac catheterization This procedure should be considered in any child with noninvasive evidence of pulmonary hypertension but especially in children with a history of hemoptysis or absence of crackles on examination. These findings have been correlated with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON Interstitial lung disease Q1. What is Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)? Answer: ILD is a group of lung diseases that cause inflammation and scarring (fibrosis) of the lung tissue around the air sacs (alveoli). This thickening makes it harder for oxygen to pass into the blood, leading to breathing difficulties. Q2. What is Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease (chILD)? Answer: chILD refers to a diverse group of rare lung diseases affecting infants, children, and teenagers. These diseases cause similar symptoms like rapid breathing, cough, and difficulty getting enough oxygen due to changes in the lung tissue. Q3. What causes ILD in children? Answer: Causes vary widely and include genetic abnormalities, developmental lung disorders, immune system problems, infections, and exposure to harmful substances. Sometimes the exact cause is unknown. Q4. What are the common symptoms of ILD or chILD? Answer: Children with ILD often have rapid or difficult breathing, a dry cough, poor growth or weight gain, low oxygen levels, and may tire easily during physical activity. Q5. How is ILD diagnosed? Answer: Diagnosis involves ruling out more common lung diseases first. Doctors use chest imaging (X-rays, CT scans), lung function tests, blood tests, and sometimes lung biopsy or genetic testing to confirm ILD. Q6. Can ILD be cured? Answer: Many forms of ILD cannot be cured, but treatments can slow disease progression, reduce symptoms, and improve quality of life. In severe cases, lung transplantation may be considered. Q7. What treatments are available for ILD? Answer: Treatment depends on the type and cause but may include anti-inflammatory medications (like corticosteroids), oxygen therapy, medications to suppress the immune system, and supportive care such as nutrition and physical therapy. Q8. How does ILD affect daily life? Answer: ILD can cause fatigue and breathing difficulties that limit physical activities. Children may need ongoing medical care and support at school and home to manage symptoms and maintain growth. Q9. Is ILD hereditary? Answer: Some types of ILD have a genetic basis, especially in children. Genetic testing and family history can help identify inherited forms. Q10. Where can I find support and more information? Answer: Specialist centers, patient support groups, and organizations like Lung Foundation Australia, Boston Children’s Hospital, and national lung disease associations provide resources and support for families affected by ILD. Doctor-patient conversation about interstitial lung disease (ILD), Doctor: \"Hello, I want to talk with you about your recent diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, or ILD. This means that the tissue in your lungs has become inflamed and scarred, which can make it harder for your lungs to work properly.\" Patient: \"What causes this disease? Did I do something to cause it?\" Doctor: \"ILD can have many causes. Sometimes it’s related to autoimmune diseases, exposure to harmful substances, infections, or medications. In some cases, we don’t know the exact cause.

The bronchioles are the smallest airways in your lungs. If you have this condition, these airways become inflamed, damaged and then scarred because of inhaling toxic substances or from infections. Other terms for this condition include obliterative bronchiolitis or constrictive bronchiolitis. Why is bronchiolitis obliterans called popcorn lung? The name probably comes from when researchers first identified the disease among workers in a microwave popcorn factory. The workers had breathed in diacetyl, a flavoring chemical used to make the popcorn taste buttery. Other industries used diacetyl for flavoring. Providers diagnosed workers in those other industries who had breathed in diacetyl with bronchiolitis obliterans. The liquid in electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or vapes also contains diacetyl. There were also cases of the disease found in workers at a coffee roasting plant. Who is more likely to get popcorn lung? Certain people have a higher risk of developing bronchiolitis obliterans because they come in close contact with toxic substances in the air. These chemicals are used in some types of manufacturing and can also be found in vapes and e-cigarettes. Toxic substances associated with developing popcorn lung Acetaldehyde. Ammonia. Chlorine. Diacetyl. Formaldehyde. Fumes from metal oxides. Hydrochloric acid. Mustard gas or sulfur mustard. Nitrogen oxides. Sulfur dioxide. Medical conditions associated with developing popcorn lung Infections, like respiratory syncytial virus, some types of pneumonia and some types of bronchitis. Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Rheumatic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Organ transplant recipients. Popcorn lung is a rare disorder, but it can happen to anyone since it can result from an infection or exposure to certain substances. Bronchiolitis obliterans can also occur without a specific exposure in people who\\'ve had a lung transplant. About 50% of people who have lung transplants will develop bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome within five years of their transplant procedure. About 10% of recipients of donor marrow also develop bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome within five years. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome This condition, which results in reduced lung function because of the scarring to small airways in the lungs, is the most common type of lung transplant rejection among lung recipients. It can look like an infection at first. The disease progresses in stages, but not the same way for everyone who has it. One person might stay in an early stage for quite some time, while another goes quickly from one stage to another more advanced stage. A lung function test called spirometry can determine how severe the disease is. causes popcorn lung Popcorn lung isn’t contagious. You can’t get it from other people or give it to other people. Popcorn lung happens from inhaling toxic chemicals, such as diacetyl, formerly used to flavor microwave popcorn. Exposure to these chemicals can happen at work or by vaping. E-cigarettes have many different types of chemicals in them that may be dangerous to your lung tissue. It’s thought that the vapor may affect not only the person vaping but also the people around them. In people who\\'ve had a lung transplant, the disease can occur without exposure to a chemical or infection. signs and symptoms of popcorn lung Signs and symptoms of popcorn lung include: Coughing, especially during and after exercise. Coughs may sometimes bring up mucus. Shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially during and after exercise. Wheezing. Tiredness. Fever. Night sweats. Skin rash. Sometimes people who have popcorn lung don’t have symptoms initially. Diagnosis and Tests OF Popcorn lung Your provider will ask you questions about your medical history and how you’re feeling. Because symptoms like difficulty breathing or being fatigued are common in other conditions, your doctor may recommend certain tests to clarify the diagnosis. These include: Imaging tests like a chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan. Lung function tests. Bronchoscopy. Lung biopsy. Management and Treatment OF Popcorn lung The damage from popcorn lung can be severe and reversal isn’t always possible. Management is likely to be more effective if your provider catches the disease early. The first thing you should do is avoid exposure to the chemicals that cause popcorn lung. If you’re at a job that exposes you to these chemicals, you need to use the recommended protective equipment. If you’re smoking or vaping, you should quit. Treatments for popcorn lung may include: Corticosteroids to fight inflammation, such as prednisone. Inhalers to help with breathing, such as those with albuterol. Oxygen therapy. Lung transplant, but this is recommended only in the most severe and extreme circumstances. Complications/side effects of corticosteroids Corticosteroids work very well to reduce inflammation, but they may cause a host of side effects. These side effects may include: Weight gain. Changes in mood. Nervousness or restlessness. Diabetes or causing existing diabetes to get worse. Trouble sleeping. Outlook / Prognosis OF Popcorn lung There’s no cure for popcorn lung. You’ll need to have life-long care to manage the symptoms, which may not always respond well to treatment. Prevention OF Popcorn lung Start early by taking care of your lungs as best you can. You can do this in the following ways: Avoid using tobacco and e-cigarettes and avoid secondhand smoke and polluted places. Avoid infections when possible. Certain infections can damage your lungs. Follow your healthcare provider\\'s suggestions on maintaining vaccine protection. If you work around dangerous substances, always wear personal protective equipment. Living With Popcorn lung Make sure that you tell your provider about any gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms so they can be treated and not cause any additional harm to your lungs. If you have a chronic illness, you might find it useful to join a support group. Sometimes sharing with others who have similar problems gives you answers and perspectives you might not find elsewhere. The support system may also be useful to caregivers, family and friends. When should I see my healthcare provider? Contact your healthcare provider if you have breathing difficulties that aren’t relieved by your rescue inhaler. Call if you have any symptoms that are new or get worse. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF Popcorn lung Asthma Bronchogenic carcinoma Bronchiectasis Cystic fibrosis Interstitial lung disease Pleural effusion Pulmonary edema Recurrent aspiration Recurrent pulmonary emboli Tracheobronchomalacia EPIDEMIOLOGY OF Popcorn lung Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is considered a form of chronic allograft rejection after lung transplantation. The majority of lung transplant recipients who are long term survivors develop bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. More than 50% of recipients will develop some degree of BO by 5 years post-transplant. The average time to diagnose BO is 16 to 20 months after lung transplant but has been reported as early as 3 months after transplantation. About 5% to 14% of Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients also develop bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, which is pulmonary graft vs. host disease and can present several months to years later after transplantation. Doctor-patient conversation about bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) Doctor: \"I want to talk to you about a condition called bronchiolitis obliterans, or BO. It’s a rare lung disease that causes inflammation and scarring in the small airways of the lungs, which can make it harder to breathe.\" Patient: \"How did I get this? Is it contagious?\" Doctor: \"BO is not contagious. It can happen after a severe lung infection, exposure to certain chemicals, or sometimes after a lung or stem cell transplant. The inflammation causes permanent narrowing of the small airways.\" Patient: \"What symptoms should I expect?\" Doctor: \"Common symptoms include a persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and feeling tired easily. These symptoms can vary depending on how much your airways are affected.\" Patient: \"How do you diagnose it?\" Doctor: \"We start by reviewing your symptoms and medical history. Tests like lung function tests and high-resolution CT scans help us see the extent of airway narrowing. Sometimes, we may use bronchoscopy or biopsy, but that’s less common.\" Patient: \"Is there a cure?\" Doctor: \"There’s no cure, but we have treatments that can slow the disease and help with symptoms. These include medications like steroids to reduce inflammation and antibiotics like azithromycin. Oxygen therapy may be needed if your oxygen levels are low.\" Patient: \"Will I need surgery?\" Doctor: \"Surgery is rarely needed, but in very severe cases, a lung transplant might be considered.\" Patient: \"What can I do to help myself?\" Doctor: \"Avoid lung irritants like smoke, follow your treatment plan, attend all follow-ups, and report any worsening symptoms promptly. Support from a team of specialists will help manage your condition.\" Patient: \"What is the outlook?\" Doctor: \"The outlook varies. Some people improve with treatment, others may have stable disease, and some may worsen. We will monitor you closely and adjust treatment as needed.\" PREDEFINED Questions and answers ON Popcorn lung Q. What is the difference between bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia? A. Bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) are two different diseases. Both diseases affect the bronchioles, but the cause of BOOP is infections, drugs or other diseases. The new name of BOOP is cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) if there is no known cause, and most cases of BOOP have no known cause. The most common symptom is a cough that lasts for some time and doesn’t bring up secretions. Q. Can popcorn lung fix itself? A. The short answer to this is no. Bronchiolitis obliterans is irreversible. Once the damage happens, you can’t fix it. You can only try to stop making it worse. Without treatment, it could be fatal. Commonly Used BOS Staging System FEF25–75% (forced expiratory flow at 25–75% of pulmonary volume) may also be used as an early marker but is less specific than FEV₁ REFERENCES Popcorn Lung: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment & Is It Real Learn About Bronchiolitis Obliterans (Popcorn Lung) | American Lung Association https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441865/#article-18642.s9 PULMONARY FIBROSIS Common Alternative Names: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) — when the cause is unknown Interstitial Pulmonary Fibrosis Fibrotic Interstitial Lung Disease Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) — a specific histopathologic pattern often seen in IPF Diffuse Pulmonary Fibrosis Fibrosing Alveolitis (older term) Pulmonary Interstitial Fibrosis Chronic Interstitial Pneumonitis DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred. This thickened, stiff tissue makes it harder for the lungs to work properly. Pulmonary fibrosis worsens over time. Some people can stay stable for a long time, but the condition gets worse faster in others. As it gets worse, people become more and more short of breath. The scarring that happens in pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by many things. Often, doctors and other healthcare professionals cannot pinpoint what\\'s causing the problem. When a cause cannot be found, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis usually occurs in middle-aged and older adults. Sometimes pulmonary fibrosis is diagnosed in children and infants, but this is not common. The lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis cannot be repaired. Medicines and therapies can sometimes help slow down the rate of fibrosis, ease symptoms and improve quality of life. For some people, a lung transplant might be an option. Causes OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS Pulmonary fibrosis is scarring and thickening of the tissue around and between the air sacs called alveoli in the lungs. These changes make it harder for oxygen to pass into the bloodstream. Damage to the lungs that results in pulmonary fibrosis may be caused by many different things. Examples include long-term exposure to certain toxins, radiation therapy, some medicines and certain medical conditions. In some cases, the cause of pulmonary fibrosis is not known. Your work and surroundings The type of work you do and where you work or live could be the cause or part of the cause for pulmonary fibrosis. Having continuous or repeated contact with toxins or pollutants — substances that harm the quality of water, air or land — can damage your lungs, especially if you do not wear protective gear. Examples include: Silica dust. Asbestos fibers. Hard metal dusts. Wood, coal and grain dusts. Mold. Bird and animal droppings. Radiation treatments Some people who receive radiation therapy to the chest, such as for lung or breast cancer, show signs of lung damage months or sometimes years after treatment. How severe the damage is may depend on: How much of the lung was exposed to radiation. The total amount of radiation given. Whether chemotherapy also was used. Whether there is underlying lung disease. Medicines Many medicines can damage the lungs. Some examples include: Chemotherapy. Medicines designed to kill cancer cells, such as methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, others), bleomycin and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), can damage lung tissue. Heart medicines. Some medicines used to treat irregular heartbeats, such as amiodarone (Nexterone, Pacerone), may harm lung tissue. Some antibiotics. Antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Macrodantin) or ethambutol (Myambutol) can cause lung damage. Anti-inflammatory medicines. Certain anti-inflammatory medicines such as rituximab (Rituxan) or sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) can cause lung damage. Medical conditions Lung damage can also result from a number of conditions, including: Dermatomyositis, an inflammatory disease marked by muscle weakness and a skin rash. Lupus, a disease that occurs when the body\\'s immune system attacks its own tissues and organs. Mixed connective tissue disease, which has a mix of symptoms of different disorders, such as lupus, scleroderma and polymyositis. Pneumonia, an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. Polymyositis, an inflammatory disease that causes muscle weakness on both sides of the body. Rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory disease that affects joints and other body systems. Sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that most often affects the lungs and lymph nodes. Scleroderma, a group of rare diseases that involve hardening and tightening of the skin as well as problems inside the body. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Many substances and conditions can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Even so, in many people, the cause is never found. But risk factors such as smoking or exposure to air pollution could be related to the condition, even if the cause cannot be confirmed. Pulmonary fibrosis with no known cause is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Many people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also may have gastroesophageal reflux disease, also called GERD. This condition occurs when acid from the stomach flows back into the esophagus. GERD may be a risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or cause the condition to worsen faster. But more studies are needed. Risk factors OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS Pulmonary fibrosis has been found in children and infants, but this is not common. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is much more likely to affect middle-aged and older adults. Other types of pulmonary fibrosis, such as that caused by connective tissue disease, can occur in younger people. Factors that can raise your risk of pulmonary fibrosis include: Smoking. If you smoke now or used to smoke, you\\'re at a higher risk of pulmonary fibrosis than people who never smoked. People with emphysema are at higher risk, too. Certain types of work. You have a higher risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis if you work in mining, farming or construction. The risk also is higher if you have continuous or repeated contact with pollutants known to damage the lungs. Cancer treatments. Having radiation treatments to your chest or using certain chemotherapy medicines can raise your risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Genetics. Some types of pulmonary fibrosis run in families, so genes may play a role. Symptoms OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS Symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis may include: Shortness of breath. Dry cough. Extreme tiredness. Weight loss that\\'s not intended. Aching muscles and joints. Widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes, called clubbing. How fast pulmonary fibrosis worsens over time and how severe the symptoms are can vary greatly from person to person. Some people become ill very quickly with severe disease. Others have moderate symptoms that worsen more slowly, over months or years. When symptoms suddenly get worse In people with pulmonary fibrosis, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, shortness of breath can suddenly get worse over a few weeks or days. This is called an acute exacerbation. It can be life-threatening. The cause of an acute exacerbation may be another condition or an illness, such as a lung infection. But usually the cause is not known. When to see a doctor If you have symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, contact your doctor or other healthcare professional as soon as possible. If your symptoms get worse, especially if they get worse fast, contact your healthcare team right away. Diagnosis OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS To diagnose pulmonary fibrosis, your doctor or other healthcare professional reviews your medical and family history and does a physical exam. You can talk about your symptoms and review any medicines you take. You also will likely be asked about any continuous or repeated contact with dusts, gases, chemicals or similar substances, especially through work. During the physical exam, your healthcare professional listens carefully to your lungs while you breathe. Pulmonary fibrosis often occurs along with a crackling sound at the base of the lungs. You may have one or more of these tests. Imaging tests Chest X-ray. Images of the chest may show the scar tissue that is usually part of pulmonary fibrosis. Sometimes the chest X-ray may not show any changes. More tests may be needed to find out why you are short of breath. Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan combines X-ray images taken from many different angles to create images of structures inside the body. A high-resolution CT scan can be helpful in diagnosing pulmonary fibrosis and in finding out how much lung damage has occurred. Some kinds of fibrosis have certain patterns. Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to look at the heart. The test can create pictures of the heart\\'s structures. It also can create videos that show how the heart is working. This test can tell the amount of pressure in the arteries of the lungs and in the right side of the heart. Lung function tests Also called pulmonary function tests, these are done to find out how well your lungs are working: Spirometry. In this test, you breathe out quickly and forcefully through a tube connected to a machine. The machine measures how much air the lungs can hold and how quickly air moves in and out of the lungs. Lung volume test. This test measures the amount of air the lungs hold at different times when breathing in and out. Lung diffusion test. This test shows how well the body moves oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the blood. Pulse oximetry. This simple test uses a small device placed on one of the fingers to measure how much oxygen is in the blood. The percentage of oxygen in the blood is called oxygen saturation. Your healthcare professional may recommend a six-minute walking test with a check of your oxygen saturation. Exercise stress test. An exercise test on a treadmill or stationary bike may be used to monitor heart and lung function during activity. Arterial blood gas test. In this test, a sample of blood, usually taken from an artery in the wrist, is tested. The oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the sample are measured. In addition to showing whether you have pulmonary fibrosis, imaging and lung function tests can be used to check your condition over time and see how treatments are working. Tissue sample If other tests cannot find the cause of your condition, a small amount of lung tissue may need to be removed. This is called a biopsy. The biopsy sample is then examined in a laboratory to diagnose pulmonary fibrosis or rule out other conditions. One of these methods can be used to get a tissue sample: Surgical biopsy. Although a surgical biopsy is invasive and has potential complications, it may be the only way to make the right diagnosis. This procedure may be done as a minimally invasive surgery called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The biopsy also may be done as an open surgery called a thoracotomy. During VATS, a surgeon inserts surgical instruments and a small camera through two or three small cuts between the ribs. The surgeon looks at the lungs on a video monitor while removing tissue samples from the lungs. During the surgery, a combination of medicines put you in a sleep-like state called general anesthesia. During a thoracotomy, a surgeon removes a lung tissue sample through a cut that opens the chest between the ribs. This open surgery also is done using general anesthesia. Bronchoscopy. In this procedure, very small tissue samples are removed — usually no larger than the head of a pin. A small, flexible tube called a bronchoscope is passed through the mouth or nose into the lungs to remove the samples. The tissue samples are sometimes too small to make the right diagnosis. But this form of biopsy also may be used to rule out other conditions. Blood tests You may have blood tests to look at your liver and kidney function. Blood tests also can check for and rule out other conditions. Treatment OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS The lung scarring and thickening that occurs in pulmonary fibrosis cannot be repaired. And no current treatment has proved effective in stopping the disease from getting worse over time. Some treatments may improve symptoms for a time or slow how fast the disease worsens. Others may help improve quality of life. Treatment depends on the cause of your pulmonary fibrosis. Doctors and other healthcare professionals evaluate how severe your condition is. Then together you can decide on the best treatment plan. Medicines FOR PULMONARY FIBROSIS If you have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, your healthcare professional may recommend the medicine pirfenidone (Esbriet) or nintedanib (Ofev). Both are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib also is approved for other types of pulmonary fibrosis that get worse quickly. These medicines may help slow the worsening of pulmonary fibrosis and may prevent bouts when symptoms suddenly get worse. Nintedanib can cause side effects such as diarrhea and nausea. Side effects of pirfenidone include nausea, loss of appetite and skin rash from sunlight. With either medicine, your healthcare professional uses regular blood tests to check how well the liver is working. New medicines and therapies are being developed or tested in clinical trials but are not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Researchers continue to study medicines to treat pulmonary fibrosis. Doctors may recommend anti-acid medicines if you have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a digestive condition that commonly occurs in people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Oxygen therapy Using extra oxygen, called supplemental oxygen, cannot stop lung damage, but it can: Make breathing and exercise easier. Prevent or lessen complications from low blood oxygen levels. Possibly lessen strain on the right side of the heart. Improve sleep and sense of well-being. You may use oxygen when you sleep or exercise. But some people need oxygen all the time. Carrying a small tank of oxygen or using a portable oxygen concentrator can help you be more mobile. Pulmonary rehabilitation Pulmonary rehabilitation can help manage your symptoms and improve your ability to do daily tasks. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs focus on: Physical exercise to improve how much you can do. Breathing techniques that may improve how well your lungs use oxygen. Nutritional counseling. Emotional counseling and support. Education about your condition. When symptoms suddenly get worse When symptoms suddenly get worse, called an acute exacerbation, you may need more supplemental oxygen. In some cases, you may need mechanical ventilation in the hospital. In this treatment, a tube is guided into the lungs and attached to a machine that helps with breathing. Your healthcare professional may recommend antibiotics, corticosteroid medicines or other medicines when symptoms suddenly get worse. Lung transplant A lung transplant may be an option for some people with pulmonary fibrosis. Having a lung transplant can improve your quality of life and allow you to live a longer life. But a lung transplant can involve complications such as rejection and infection. After a lung transplant, you take medicines for the rest of your life. You and your healthcare team may discuss a lung transplant if it\\'s thought to be the right treatment option for your condition. Lifestyle and home remedies FOR PULMONARY FIBROSIS Being actively involved in your treatment and staying as healthy as possible are essential to living with pulmonary fibrosis. It\\'s important to: Stop smoking. If you have lung disease, it is important to stop smoking. Talk with your healthcare team about options for quitting, including smoking cessation programs. These use proven techniques to help people quit. Because secondhand smoke can be harmful to your lungs, avoid being around people who are smoking. Avoid other things that can irritate your lungs. Breathing indoor pollutants, such as fumes from heating fuel or chemicals, can irritate your lungs. So can outdoor pollutants, such as dust or car exhaust. Eat well. People with lung disease may lose weight both because eating is not comfortable and because of the extra energy it takes to breathe. A healthy diet that contains enough calories is needed. Try to eat smaller meals more often during the day. A dietitian can give you more information on healthy eating for your condition. Get moving. Regular exercise can help you keep your lung function and manage your stress. Aim to include physical activity, such as walking or biking, into your daily routine. Talk to your healthcare team about what activities may be best for you. If over time you need help getting around, such as using a wheelchair, look for active movements you can do that do not require walking. One example is tai chi. Take time to rest. Make sure to get enough rest. Taking time to rest can help you have more energy and cope with the stress of your condition. If you have problems sleeping, talk with your healthcare team. Get vaccinated. Respiratory infections, such as colds and flu, can worsen symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis. Make sure that you get the pneumonia vaccine, an annual flu shot and COVID-19 vaccines. It\\'s important that your family members also be vaccinated. Try to stay out of crowds when possible. Follow your treatment plan. You usually need ongoing treatment from your healthcare team. Follow the care team\\'s instructions. Take your medicines as prescribed. Adjust your diet and exercise as needed. Attend pulmonary rehabilitation sessions. Go to all of your appointments and contact your care team if symptoms worsen. Complications OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS Complications of pulmonary fibrosis may include: High blood pressure in the lungs. Called pulmonary hypertension, this type of high blood pressure affects the arteries in the lungs. These are the pulmonary arteries. Stiff and thick arteries may slow down or block blood flow through the lungs. This raises the pressure inside the pulmonary arteries and the lower right heart chamber, called the right ventricle. Right-sided heart failure. This serious condition occurs when your heart\\'s right chamber has to pump harder than usual to move blood through partly blocked pulmonary arteries. Respiratory failure. This is often the last stage of long-term lung disease. It occurs when blood oxygen levels fall dangerously low. Lung cancer. Long-standing pulmonary fibrosis increases your risk of developing lung cancer. Other lung problems. As pulmonary fibrosis gets worse over time, it may lead to serious problems such as blood clots in the lungs, a collapsed lung or lung infections. Outlook / Prognosis OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS Lung scarring is nearly always permanent (unless caused by a medication and caught early). If you have an underlying disease, management of it might help prevent further damage. If the cause is unknown, your healthcare provider will treat your symptoms and try to prevent more damage. Healthcare providers can’t easily predict how pulmonary fibrosis will progress. Your symptoms may get worse very slowly, over years. In some cases, the disease may lead to severe symptoms quickly (over months). How long can a person live with pulmonary fibrosis? The life expectancy of someone with the most common form, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is three to five years. But life expectancies for people with PF have been getting longer in recent years. Prevention OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS Many causes of pulmonary fibrosis aren’t preventable. You can reduce your risk of lung scarring from environmental exposures by: Avoiding substances that can harm your lungs, such as asbestos, metal dust or chemicals, and wearing a respirator (a mask that filters particles from the air) if you have to work with them Avoiding things that can cause chronic allergic reactions, like hay, grain, bird droppings or feathers, and heating and cooling systems — and wearing a respirator mask if you have to work with them Not smoking or quitting smoking Differential Diagnoses OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Amyloidosis Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema Drug-Induced Pulmonary Toxicity Malignancy Nitrogen Dioxide Toxicity Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia (PJP) Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary Eosinophilia Restrictive Lung Disease Viral Pneumonia Epidemiology OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS Frequency As a group, diffuse interstitial diseases of the lung are uncommon. Of patients referred to a pulmonary disease specialist, an estimated 10-15% have a DPLD. In the United States, the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimated over 650,000 cases, with an age-standardized prevalence varying from 101 to 156 cases per 100,000 people among states. Race One multicenter study that included 5275 ILD patients in the United States showed a racial and ethnic group breakdown of 83.2% White, 10.2% Black, and 6.7% Hispanic patients. The etiology of ILD varied among racial and ethnic groups, with IPF having the highest prevalence in White patients, HP having the highest prevalence in Hispanic patients, and CTD-ILD having the highest prevalence in Black patients. Black patients were more likely than Hispanic and White patients to be hospitalized, undergo lung transplant, and die at a younger age. Sex Evaluation of data from the GBD study showed a higher prevalence of ILD among females, with age-adjusted prevalence of 131.4 per 100,000, compared to 121.3 per 100,000 in males in the United States. Several DPLDs show sex-related differences in frequency. In general, IPF affects men more than women (at a ratio of 1.5:1), while LAM and pulmonary tuberous sclerosis almost exclusively affect women. Women are much more likely to develop CTD-ILD than men and thus are more likely to experience pulmonary manifestations of those diseases. However, when affected, men with certain rheumatologic diseases (e.g. RA) are more likely to develop pulmonary manifestations than women. The pneumoconiosis (e.g., silicosis) are much more common in men than in women, which may be due to higher rates of occupational exposure. Age Many of the DPLDs develop over many years and therefore are more prevalent in older adults. For example, most patients with IPF present in the sixth or greater decade of life. Others form of interstitial lung disease, such as sarcoidosis, LAM, connective-tissue disease–associated lung disease, and inherited forms of lung disease primarily present in younger adults. Procedures FOR PULMONARY FIBROSIS The role of lung biopsy remains controversial, with expert opinion weighing in on both sides. Consensus appears to be building on the side of forgoing biopsy when the typical clinical and high-resolution CT scan features of a specific disease process are present. A multidisciplinary discussion is an essential part of diagnosis of ILD and deciding whether biopsy is necessary. This discussion often includes pulmonologists, radiologists, pathologists, thoracic surgeons, and rheumatologists. Multidisciplinary discussions can improve diagnosis by involving more specialties in the discussion, minimizing the effects of interobserver variability, and potentially avoiding invasive procedures. Transbronchial and endobronchial lung biopsies may be diagnostic, particularly for sarcoidosis, HP, or lymphangitic spread of carcinoma but frequently are not useful for other diagnoses. This is due to the patchy and often peripheral, rather than airway-centric, distribution of the majority of these diseases. Surgical lung biopsy is regarded as the gold standard diagnostic test, however the most recent guidelines suggest that transbronchial cryobiopsy may be an acceptable alternative, in centers with sufficient experience performing the procedure. A balance of risks of these procedures must be weighed with the likelihood of obtaining a diagnostic result. Bronchiolar lavage (BAL) may be helpful in differentiating some types of DPLD from others. Bronchiolar lavage is useful in evaluating the possibility of infection or malignancy. Cell count and differential analysis can differentiate DPLDs that have particular associations with lymphocyte-, neutrophilic-, eosinophilic predominance. For example, IPF is associated with neutrophil predominance, while HP is associated with lymphocyte predominance. Special stains can provide diagnostic value, as in the case of Periodic acid Schiff stain positivity for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). Predisposition to Pulmonary Fibrosis: Genes and Distinguishing Clinical Features PREDEFINED Questions and answers FOR PULMONARY FIBROSIS Q. What are the stages of pulmonary fibrosis? A. While there’s no official staging system for pulmonary fibrosis, some providers may describe pulmonary fibrosis as mild, moderate, severe or very severe. They base this diagnosis on your symptoms, lung function tests and imaging. Q. At what age does pulmonary fibrosis start? A. Most cases of pulmonary fibrosis are diagnosed in people 65 and older DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON PULMONARY FIBROSIS Doctor: \"Hello, I want to discuss the results of your tests. You have a condition called pulmonary fibrosis, which means there is scarring in your lungs that makes it harder for oxygen to pass into your bloodstream.\" Patient: \"What causes this? Is it something I did?\" Doctor: \"Pulmonary fibrosis can have many causes, including environmental exposures, certain medications, infections, or autoimmune diseases. Sometimes, we don’t find a specific cause, which we call idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It’s not your fault, and it’s not contagious.\" Patient: \"What symptoms should I expect?\" Doctor: \"Common symptoms include shortness of breath, especially when active, a dry cough, and fatigue. These symptoms can slowly get worse over time.\" Patient: \"Is there a cure?\" Doctor: \"Currently, there is no cure, but we have treatments that can slow the progression of the disease and help you manage symptoms. We’ll also focus on keeping you as comfortable as possible and maintaining your quality of life.\" Patient: \"What treatments are available?\" Doctor: \"There are medications called antifibrotics that can slow lung scarring. We may also recommend oxygen therapy if your oxygen levels are low, pulmonary rehabilitation to help with breathing and exercise, and support services.\" Patient: \"How will this affect my life?\" Doctor: \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic condition, and it can impact your daily activities. We’ll work together to monitor your lung function regularly and adjust treatments as needed. It’s important to avoid smoking and lung irritants, stay active within your limits, and get vaccinated against respiratory infections.\" Patient: \"What should I do if my symptoms get worse?\" Doctor: \"If you notice increased shortness of breath, coughing, or fatigue, please contact us promptly. Early intervention can help manage flare-ups and complications.\" Patient: \"This sounds overwhelming. How can I cope?\" Doctor: \"It’s normal to feel overwhelmed. We have resources including patient education, counseling, and support groups. Our team, including nurses and therapists, will support you throughout your journey. Please feel free to ask any questions at any time.\" REFERENCES Pulmonary Fibrosis: Causes, Symptoms & Treatment Pulmonary fibrosis - Diagnosis and treatment - Mayo Clinic https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1230/ https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301337-workup#c5 NEUROENDOCRINE HYPERPLASIA OF INFANCY ALTERNATIVE NAMES chronic tachypnea of infancy (CTI) persistent tachypnea of infancy (PTI) NEHI DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION NEUROENDOCRINE HYPERPLASIA OF INFANCY Neuroendocrine hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI), is a rare lung disease that affects children, typically presenting in the first two years of life. NEHI typically presents in otherwise healthy infants during the first months to the first year of life. It is characterized by persistent rapid and labored breathing (tachypnea), crackles and low oxygen levels (hypoxemia). The cause of NEHI is currently poorly understood.The prevalence is not well known, but it is considered a rare disease. The hallmark diagnostic features of NEHI on chest computed tomography (CT) include hyperinflation and ground-glass opacities in characteristic distributions, without other parenchymal abnormalities.2,7 While symptoms such as breathing difficulties and low oxygen levels tend to improve with time, they can persist for years, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and long-term management. Some patients undergo a lung biopsy which shows an increased number of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNEC). The role of PNECs in NEHI is not well understood. Treatment is largely supportive including supplemental oxygen and ensuring the patient has adequate growth Causes of NEUROENDOCRINE HYPERPLASIA OF INFANCY The cause of NEHI remains unknown, but there is evidence suggesting genetic factors may play a role. A change (variant) in the NKX2-1 gene was identified in a patient with NEHI, along with family members who had childhood lung disease, indicating a possible genetic link. While increased numbers of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are found in NEHI patients, it is not clear whether these cells are directly involved in the development of the disease or serve as markers of the disorder.These cells play a role in oxygen sensing and lung epithelial regeneration, potentially contributing to disease symptoms. However, more research is needed to understand the full range of influences on NEHI. Signs & Symptoms of NEUROENDOCRINE HYPERPLASIA OF INFANCY Children with NEHI often present in the first year of life with:1,2,4,6,7 – Rapid, shallow breathing (tachypnea) – Increased work of breathing, including retractions – Low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxemia) – Crackling sounds (crackles) heard with a stethoscope – Failure to gain weight (failure to thrive) These symptoms can often be mistaken for more common conditions, leading to initial misdiagnoses of asthma or recurrent respiratory infections. Unlike asthma, wheezing is not a common symptom, and children with NEHI do not typically respond to asthma medications such as inhaled corticosteroids. Disorders with Similar Symptoms Asthma/reactive airway disease Bronchiolitis Diagnosis of NEUROENDOCRINE HYPERPLASIA OF INFANCY Doctors typically diagnose NEHI by looking at symptoms and using specialized tests. A high-resolution CT scan of the chest is a key tool. It can show characteristic patterns like ground-glass opacities (which look hazy on the scan) and air trapping, both of which are common in NEHI. Additionally, infant pulmonary function tests (PFTs) may help confirm the diagnosis by detecting signs of air trapping in the lungs. In most people, these noninvasive imaging and testing methods are enough to make a diagnosis of NEHI without needing more invasive procedures. However, if the imaging results are unclear or the symptoms are not typical of NEHI, doctors might need to do a lung biopsy. During this procedure, a small piece of lung tissue is removed and analyzed. The biopsy is stained with a special marker (called bombesin) to identify the increased presence of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs). Since biopsies are more invasive, they are usually only done in cases where the noninvasive image tests are not conclusive. In most people, NEHI can now be confidently diagnosed through clinical symptoms and imaging tests alone. Standard Therapies There is no cure or specific treatment for NEHI, and management is primarily supportive. Most of the affected children require supplemental oxygen to address low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxemia) and nutritional support is often necessary to manage growth delays. The use of medications such as inhaled corticosteroids typically used for asthma, has not been found to be effective in NEHI. Immunizations, including the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are crucial in preventing further respiratory complications. Genetic counseling may be recommended, especially in cases where familial lung disease is present. Long-term supportive care is recommended for families coping with a diagnosis of NEH DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS of NEUROENDOCRINE HYPERPLASIA OF INFANCY Other Childhood Interstitial Lung Diseases (chILD): Surfactant dysfunction disorders (e.g., SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3 mutations) Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (PIG) Diffuse developmental lung disorders (e.g., acinar dysplasia, alveolar capillary dysplasia) Alveolar growth abnormalities (e.g., chronic neonatal lung disease, pulmonary hypoplasia) Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP) Infectious Pneumonitis (viral or bacterial infections causing chronic symptoms) Bronchiolitis Obliterans Congenital Lung Malformations (e.g., congenital pulmonary airway malformation, bronchopulmonary sequestration) Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Cystic Fibrosis Asthma or Reactive Airway Disease (usually older children, reversible airway obstruction) Pulmonary Vascular Disease (rare in infants but can cause respiratory distress) Epidemiology of Neuroendocrine Cell Hyperplasia of Infancy (NEHI) Prevalence: The exact prevalence of NEHI is unknown. It is considered a rare pediatric interstitial lung disease, but likely underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with other lung diseases and the limited need for lung biopsy in mild cases. Age of Onset: NEHI primarily affects infants, with the mean age of presentation around 3 to 4 months. Most cases occur within the first year of life, but older children can also be affected. Gender Distribution: Some studies report a male predominance (about 66% male in one large series). Clinical Presentation: Infants typically present with persistent tachypnea (rapid breathing), chest retractions, hypoxemia (low oxygen levels), crackles on lung auscultation, and sometimes failure to thrive. Prognosis: The prognosis is generally good, with many infants improving over time. However, some patients may have persistent respiratory symptoms, oxygen requirement, or recurrent infections for months or years. Etiology: The cause of NEHI remains unknown, but genetic factors are suspected given rare familial cases reported. It is not inherited in a typical Mendelian pattern, and no clear environmental cause has been identified. Diagnostic Imaging: High-resolution CT typically shows patchy ground-glass opacities, especially in the right middle lobe and lingula, along with air trapping Predefined Questions and Answers for NEHI Q1. What is Neuroendocrine Cell Hyperplasia of Infancy (NEHI)? A. NEHI is a rare lung disease in infants where there is an increased number of neuroendocrine cells in the small airways. This causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to breathing difficulties. Q2. What causes NEHI? A. The exact cause of NEHI is unknown. It is not inherited or contagious. It may be related to abnormal lung development or repair after injury, but research is ongoing. Q3. What are the common symptoms of NEHI? A. Infants with NEHI usually have persistent rapid breathing (tachypnea), low oxygen levels (hypoxemia), chest retractions, crackling sounds in the lungs, and sometimes poor weight gain. Q4. How is NEHI diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is mainly based on clinical symptoms and a high-resolution CT scan showing characteristic ground-glass opacities in the right middle lobe and lingula. Lung biopsy is rarely needed but can confirm diagnosis by showing increased neuroendocrine cells. Q5. Is NEHI curable? A. There is no cure, but the condition often improves over time. Many children gradually get better with supportive care. Q6. What treatments are available for NEHI? A. Treatment is supportive and includes supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen levels, nutritional support, and monitoring. There are no specific medications to cure NEHI. Q7. How long does NEHI last? A. Symptoms often improve over months to years, but some children may have persistent mild symptoms or oxygen needs for a longer time. Q8. Can NEHI be prevented? A. Since the cause is unknown, there are no known prevention strategies. Q9. Will NEHI affect my child’s growth and development? A. Most children with NEHI grow and develop normally with proper medical care, although close monitoring is important. Q10. Where can I get support and more information? A. Support groups, specialist pediatric pulmonologists, and organizations like the chILD Foundation provide resources and guidance for families affected by NEHI. Neuroendocrine Cell Hyperplasia of Infancy (NEHI) — Treatment, Drugs, and Side Effects 1. Main Treatments for NEHI Oxygen Therapy: Most infants with NEHI require supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen levels, especially during sleep or illness. Oxygen may be needed continuously or intermittently and is gradually weaned as the child improves. Side effects are generally minimal but may include nasal irritation or dryness. Nutritional Support: Infants with NEHI often have increased energy needs due to labored breathing and may experience poor weight gain. High-calorie feeds, nutritional supplements, or feeding tubes (e.g., nasogastric tube) may be necessary. Side effects depend on feeding method but can include discomfort or risk of aspiration with tube feeding. 2. Medications Used (Off-Label / Empirical) Corticosteroids: Sometimes used to reduce airway inflammation, but evidence suggests they are less effective in NEHI than in other interstitial lung diseases. Side effects include immunosuppression, growth retardation, weight gain, hypertension, and mood changes. Use is individualized and discussed case-by-case. Azithromycin: An antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties occasionally used to help reduce airway inflammation. Side effects may include gastrointestinal upset and potential antibiotic resistance. Hydroxychloroquine: An antimalarial drug with anti-inflammatory effects used in some interstitial lung diseases. Side effects include retinal toxicity (rare), gastrointestinal symptoms, and skin reactions. 3. Other Management Considerations Vaccinations: Ensuring all routine childhood vaccines, including influenza, to reduce risk of respiratory infections which can worsen NEHI. Monitoring and Follow-Up: Regular clinical and imaging follow-up to monitor lung function and oxygen needs. Supportive Care: Avoidance of respiratory irritants and infections. Physical therapy and developmental support as needed. 4. Prognosis and Treatment Outcomes Most children with NEHI improve over months to years, often weaning off oxygen and achieving normal growth and development. No specific curative drug treatment exists; supportive care remains the cornerstone. Clinical improvement often occurs regardless of initial treatment intensity. Doctor-patient conversation about Neuroendocrine Cell Hyperplasia of Infancy (NEHI) Doctor: \"I want to talk with you about your baby\\'s breathing difficulties. The diagnosis is called Neuroendocrine Cell Hyperplasia of Infancy, or NEHI for short. It’s a rare lung condition that affects infants, causing fast and heavy breathing.\" Parent: \"What exactly is NEHI? How does it affect my baby?\" Doctor: \"In NEHI, there are extra neuroendocrine cells in the small airways of the lungs. These cells are normally present but in NEHI they are increased, which can cause inflammation and narrowing of the airways. This makes it harder for your baby to get enough oxygen and can cause symptoms like rapid breathing, low oxygen levels, and sometimes trouble gaining weight.\" Parent: \"What causes NEHI? Is it something I did or something contagious?\" Doctor: \"We don’t know the exact cause yet. It’s not contagious and not caused by anything you did. Researchers think it might be related to both genetics and environmental factors, but more studies are needed to understand it fully.\" Parent: \"How do you know my baby has NEHI? What tests did you do?\" Doctor: \"We rely mainly on your baby’s symptoms and a special type of lung scan called a high-resolution CT. This scan shows a typical pattern of changes in certain parts of the lungs, especially the right middle lobe and the lingula. Sometimes, if needed, a lung biopsy can confirm the diagnosis, but usually the clinical picture and imaging are enough.\" Parent: \"Is there a cure? What treatments are available?\" Doctor: \"There’s no cure at the moment, but the good news is most babies with NEHI improve over time. Treatment focuses on supporting your baby\\'s breathing and nutrition. Many babies need supplemental oxygen to keep their oxygen levels normal, and some may need extra help with feeding to ensure they grow well.\" Parent: \"How long will my baby need oxygen? Will this get better?\" Doctor: \"Most children gradually get stronger as they grow, and many can stop needing oxygen after some time. Older children might only need oxygen during sleep or when they have infections. We will monitor your baby closely and adjust care as needed.\" Parent: \"What should I watch for? When should I call you?\" Doctor: \"If your baby is working very hard to breathe, has increased breathing difficulty, or if you notice any changes like poor feeding or unusual tiredness, please contact us right away. Also, protecting your baby from infections is very important, so make sure vaccinations are up to date and avoid exposure to sick people.\" Parent: \"Is there support available for families like ours?\" Doctor: \"Yes, there are support groups and resources through organizations like the chILD Foundation. We can connect you with specialists and other families who understand what you’re going through.\" REFERENCES Neuroendocrine Cell Hyperplasia of Infancy - Symptoms, Causes, Treatment | NORD https://ajronline.org/doi/10.2214/AJR.09.2743 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Alternative Names for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) RSV (common abbreviation) Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Human Orthopneumovirus (official taxonomic name by ICTV) Pneumovirus (historical classification) Respiratory Syncytial Pneumovirus (less common) DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RSV is a respiratory illness that can cause cold-like symptoms or, sometimes, serious illness. RSV stands for respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, the germ that makes you sick with RSV. Almost everyone gets it for the first time before the age of 2. But the protection (immunity) you get from being infected doesn’t last, so you can get it more than once. RSV is more common than you might think. We most often hear about babies getting severely ill from RSV, but adults and kids of all ages get it. Infants are more likely to get very sick from RSV because their immune systems are still developing. Their smaller airways are also more likely to get inflamed. You can also get RSV many times throughout your life — sometimes even twice in one year. For adults, it usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. But adults over 65 and people with compromised immune systems are at a higher risk for serious illness. RSV causes A virus — respiratory syncytial virus — causes RSV. It’s not caused by bacteria. RSV spreads through: Close contact with someone who has it Coughing and sneezing (respiratory droplets) Contaminated objects or surfaces (think toys, countertops and phones) Is RSV contagious? Yes, RSV is contagious while you have symptoms — usually three to eight days. RSV spreads easily from person to person. It can live on hard surfaces, like tables, for several hours. You may be able to spread RSV a day or two before you develop symptoms. Babies and people with compromised immune systems may be contagious even after symptoms go away, for up to four weeks. Risk factors OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) By age 2, most children will have been infected with respiratory syncytial virus, but they can get infected by RSV more than once. Children who attend child care centers or who have siblings who attend school are at a higher risk of exposure and reinfection. RSV season — when outbreaks tend to occur — is the fall to the end of spring. People at increased risk of severe or sometimes life-threatening RSV infections include: Infants, especially premature infants or babies who are 6 months or younger Children who have heart disease that\\'s present from birth (congenital heart disease) or chronic lung disease Children or adults with weakened immune systems from diseases such as cancer or treatment such as chemotherapy Children who have neuromuscular disorders, such as muscular dystrophy Adults with heart disease or lung disease Older adults, especially those age 65 and older Symptoms OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Signs and symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection most commonly appear about four to six days after exposure to the virus. In adults and older children, RSV usually causes mild cold-like signs and symptoms. These may include: Congested or runny nose Dry cough Low-grade fever Sore throat Sneezing Headache In severe cases RSV infection can spread to the lower respiratory tract, causing pneumonia or bronchiolitis — inflammation of the small airway passages entering the lungs. Signs and symptoms may include: Fever Severe cough Wheezing — a high-pitched noise that\\'s usually heard on breathing out (exhaling) Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing — the person may prefer to sit up rather than lie down Bluish color of the skin due to lack of oxygen (cyanosis) Infants are most severely affected by RSV. Signs and symptoms of severe RSV infection in infants include: Short, shallow and rapid breathing Struggling to breathe — chest muscles and skin pull inward with each breath Cough Poor feeding Unusual tiredness (lethargy) Irritability Most children and adults recover in one to two weeks, although some might have repeated wheezing. Severe or life-threatening infection requiring a hospital stay may occur in premature infants or in anyone who has chronic heart or lung problems. RSV and COVID-19 Because RSV and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are both types of respiratory viruses, some symptoms of RSV and COVID-19 can be similar. In children, COVID-19 often results in mild symptoms such as fever, runny nose and cough. For adults with COVID-19, symptoms may be more severe and may include trouble breathing. Having RSV may lower immunity and increase the risk of getting COVID-19 — for kids and adults. And these infections may occur together, which can worsen the severity of COVID-19 illness. If you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, your doctor may recommend testing for COVID-19 . When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical attention if your child — or anyone at risk of severe RSV infection — has difficulty breathing, a high fever, or a blue color to the skin, particularly on the lips and in the nail beds. Diagnosis OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Your doctor may suspect respiratory syncytial virus based on the findings of a physical exam and the time of year the symptoms occur. During the exam, the doctor will listen to the lungs with a stethoscope to check for wheezing or other abnormal sounds. Laboratory and imaging tests aren\\'t usually needed. However, they can help diagnose RSV complications or rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Tests may include: Blood tests to check white cell counts or to look for viruses, bacteria and other germs Chest X-rays to check for lung inflammation Swab of secretions from inside the mouth or nose to check for signs of the virus Pulse oximetry, a painless skin monitor, to detect lower than normal levels of oxygen in the blood Treatment OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Treatment for respiratory syncytial virus generally involves self-care measures to make your child more comfortable (supportive care). But hospital care may be needed if severe symptoms occur. Supportive care Your doctor may recommend an over-the-counter medication such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to reduce fever. (Never give aspirin to a child.) Use of nasal saline drops and suctioning may help clear a stuffy nose. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics if there\\'s a bacterial complication, such as bacterial pneumonia. Keep your child as comfortable as possible. Offer plenty of fluids and watch for signs of loss of body fluids (dehydration), such as dry mouth, little to no urine output, sunken eyes, and extreme fussiness or sleepiness. Hospital care If the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is severe, a hospital stay may be necessary. Treatments at the hospital may include: Intravenous (IV) fluids Humidified oxygen A breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), in rare cases An inhaler (bronchodilator) or steroids are not proved to be helpful in treating RSV infection. Self-care ON Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) You may not be able to shorten the length of a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, but you can try to relieve some signs and symptoms. If your child has RSV, do your best to comfort or distract him or her — cuddle, read a book or play a quiet game. Other tips for relieving symptoms are: Create moist air to breathe. Keep the room warm but not overheated. If the air is dry, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer can moisten the air and help ease congestion and coughing. Be sure to keep the humidifier clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds. Drink fluids. Continue breastfeeding or bottle-feeding your infant as you would normally. For older children and adults, keep a steady supply of cool water at the bedside. Offer warm fluids, such as soup, which may help loosen thickened secretions. Ice pops may be soothing as well. Try saline nasal drops. Over-the-counter (OTC) drops are a safe, effective way to ease congestion, even for young children. Follow your doctor\\'s recommendations and the instructions on the product. Use over-the-counter pain relievers. OTC pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) may help reduce fever and relieve a sore throat. Ask a doctor for the correct dose for your child\\'s age. Stay away from cigarette smoke. Secondhand smoke can aggravate symptoms. Complications OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Complications of respiratory syncytial virus include: Hospitalization. A severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection may require a hospital stay so that doctors can monitor and treat breathing problems and give intravenous (IV) fluids. Pneumonia. RSV is the most common cause of inflammation of the lungs (pneumonia) or the lungs\\' airways (bronchiolitis) in infants. These complications can occur when the virus spreads to the lower respiratory tract. Lung inflammation can be quite serious in infants, young children, older adults, immunocompromised individuals, or people with chronic heart or lung disease. Middle ear infection. If germs enter the space behind the eardrum, you can get a middle ear infection (otitis media). This happens most frequently in babies and young children. Asthma. There may be a link between severe RSV in children and the chance of developing asthma later in life. Repeated infections. Once you\\'ve had RSV, you could get infected again. It\\'s even possible for it to happen during the same RSV season. However, symptoms usually aren\\'t as severe — typically it\\'s in the form of a common cold. But they can be serious in older adults or in people with chronic heart or lung disease. Prevention OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Respiratory syncytial virus can infect anyone. But premature babies and young infants, as well as older adults, with heart or lung disease or a weakened immune system are at higher risk of severe infection. Protection for babies and high-risk young children Two main options exist to help prevent young infants from getting severe Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). One is an antibody product given to the infant. The other is an RSV vaccine for pregnant people to help protect their baby from birth through 6 months of age. Both are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). You and your healthcare professional can discuss which option is best to protect your child. Antibody product called nirsevimab (Beyfortus). This antibody product is a single dose shot given in the month before or during RSV season. It\\'s for babies younger than 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season. Nirsevimab also can be given to children 8 months through 19 months old who are at higher risk of severe RSV disease through their second RSV season. In the U.S., the RSV season typically is November through March, but it varies in Florida, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam and other U.S. Pacific Island territories. In rare situations, when nirsevimab is not available or a child is not eligible for it, another antibody product called palivizumab may be given. But palivizumab requires monthly shots given during the RSV season, while nirsevimab is only one shot. Palivizumab is not recommended for healthy children or adults. Vaccine for pregnant people. The FDA approved an RSV vaccine called Abrysvo for pregnant people to prevent RSV in infants from birth through 6 months of age. A single dose shot of Abrysvo can be given sometime from 32 weeks through 36 weeks of pregnancy during September through January in the U.S. Vaccine for older adults Older adults have weaker immune systems, especially those with ongoing conditions, such as heart or lung disease. To help prevent RSV infection, the FDA approved RSV vaccines for adults age 60 and older. The CDC recommends that adults age 60 and older talk with their healthcare professional about getting an RSV vaccine, especially if they\\'re at higher risk of getting severe RSV. Two vaccines are available for this age group: Abrysvo and Arexvy. The CDC does not recommend one over the other. Each is a single dose shot. Talk with your healthcare team about the benefits and risks of RSV vaccines for your situation. Lifestyle habits OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) These lifestyle habits can help prevent the spread of this infection: Wash your hands often. Teach your children the importance of handwashing. Avoid exposure. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Limit your baby\\'s contact with people who have fevers or colds. Keep things clean. Make sure kitchen and bathroom countertops, doorknobs, and handles are clean. Put used tissues in the trash right away. Don\\'t share drinking glasses with others. Use your own glass or disposable cups when you or someone else is sick. Label each person\\'s cup. Don\\'t smoke. Babies who are exposed to tobacco smoke have a higher risk of getting RSV and potentially more-severe symptoms. If you do smoke, never do so inside the house or car. Wash toys regularly. Do this especially when your child or a playmate is sick. Outlook / Prognosis OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RSV can last a week or two. You might have a lingering cough for a while. Severe cases of RSV may last longer. Is there anything I can do to feel better? If you have mild symptoms, you can take care of yourself at home with: A cool-mist humidifier to help with breathing Nasal saline spray to help relieve cough and congestion Suctioning your child’s nose to remove mucus Plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration Over the counter (OTC) medications (like acetaminophen or ibuprofen) Always check with your provider or your child’s pediatrician before using any medications or giving them to kids. Diagnostic Considerations OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) High-risk groups for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection include the following: Premature infants in their first year of life (the younger the child is [in gestational and chronologic age] at the start of RSV season, the greater the risk) Infants with chronic lung disease (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or cystic fibrosis) during their first 2 years of life Children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, especially with increased pulmonary blood flow Patients with immunodeficient states Children with metabolic disorders, structural airway abnormalities, and neuromuscular disorders Children of multiple births (triplets or greater) Differential Diagnoses OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Adenovirus Asthma Bronchiolitis Croup Human Metapneumovirus Influenza Neonatal Sepsis Other respiratory viruses Upper respiratory tract infection, croup, and bronchiolitis caused by RSV is clinically indistinguishable from other respiratory infections Human Parainfluenza Viruses (HPIV) and Other Parainfluenza Viruses Pediatric Bronchitis Pediatric Pneumonia Epidemiology OF Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RSV LRT infection develops annually in 4-5 million children, and more than 125,000 children are admitted per year for RSV-related illness. The burden of RSV infection is not limited to only young children. In United States, it is responsible for 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths in elderly ≥ 65 years of age. Seasonal variations in incidence are observed (see the image below). Reinfection occurs throughout life, with the disease generally limited to the upper respiratory tract in persons older than 3 years. RSV infection is primarily seen in the winter months throughout United States except in the state of Florida where it extends throughout much of the year. Nationally, the onset of RSV season ranges from mid-September to mid-November, peaks from mid-December to mid-February, and the off-season occurs mid-April to mid-May. In tropical climates peak RSV activity correlates with the rainy season. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the typical patterns of circulation for RSV. Starting in the southern United States, RSV circulation increased during the spring of 2021 and peaked in the summer. Severe RSV disease has been reported in older children and adults with SCID (e.g., bone marrow transplantation), and RSV disease of the lower respiratory tract has been reported in elderly persons. RSV infection can also be severe in adults with COPD, those with immunodeficiency, and those ≥ 65 years of age. Worldwide, RSV infection is prevalent, with clinical manifestations and early occurrence of RSV LRTI comparable to those seen in the United States. Each year RSV infection causes more than 100,000 deaths among children younger than 5 years throughout the world. Nearly half of those deaths occur in infants younger than 6 months old. In addition, RSV infection accounts for an estimated 3.6 million hospital admissions globally each year. Severe RSV disease is primarily a disease of young infants and children, with a peak occurrence at the age of 2-8 months. Reinfection with RSV occurs throughout life, with disease becoming increasingly limited to the upper respiratory tract with advancing age. Although boys and girls are equally affected by milder RSV disease, males are approximately twice as likely to be hospitalized for RSV disease. All races appear to be susceptible to RSV, showing similar disease patterns. Predefined Questions and Answers for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Q1. What is RSV? A. RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) is a common respiratory virus that causes cold-like symptoms in most people. It can cause mild upper respiratory illness but may lead to serious lung infections like bronchiolitis and pneumonia, especially in infants and older adults. Q2. What are the symptoms of RSV? A. Symptoms usually start with a runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever, and wheezing. In very young infants, symptoms may be subtle, such as irritability, decreased activity, and breathing difficulties. Q3. Who is at risk for severe RSV disease? A. Severe RSV is most common in infants under 6 months, premature babies, children with chronic lung or heart disease, immunodeficient individuals, and older adults with underlying health conditions. Q4. How is RSV transmitted? A. RSV spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and by direct contact with contaminated surfaces or people. Q5. How long is the incubation period? A. Symptoms typically appear 4 to 7 days after exposure to the virus. Q6. How is RSV diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is usually clinical but can be confirmed by laboratory tests such as PCR or antigen detection from nasal swabs. Q7. Is there a treatment for RSV? A. There is no specific antiviral treatment for RSV. Care focuses on relieving symptoms, maintaining hydration, and oxygen therapy if needed. Fever and pain can be managed with acetaminophen or ibuprofen (never aspirin in children). Q8. When should I seek medical care for RSV? A. Seek care if there is difficulty breathing, persistent high fever, dehydration, or if the infant is very young or has underlying health conditions. Q9. Can RSV be prevented? A. Preventive measures include good hand hygiene, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and cleaning surfaces. There are now vaccines and monoclonal antibodies available for high-risk infants and older adults to prevent severe RSV disease. Q10. What is the prognosis for RSV infection? A. Most people recover within 1 to 2 weeks. However, severe cases can lead to hospitalization and, rarely, death, especially in high-risk groups. Early RSV infection may increase the risk of wheezing or asthma later in childhood Genomic Data of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Genome Type: RSV has a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome approximately 15,191 to 15,226 nucleotides in length, typically around 15.2 kb. Genome Organization: The genome is non segmented and linear, containing 10 genes arranged in the order: 3′ NS1 - NS2 - N - P - M - SH - G - F - M2 - L 5′ These genes encode 11 proteins, including structural and nonstructural proteins. Proteins Encoded: NS1 and NS2: Nonstructural proteins that inhibit host interferon responses. N (nucleoprotein): Encapsidates the RNA genome. P (phosphoprotein): Cofactor for RNA polymerase. M (matrix protein): Involved in virus assembly. SH (small hydrophobic protein): Forms ion channels; function not fully understood. G (attachment glycoprotein): Mediates viral attachment; highly glycosylated and variable; modulates immune response. F (fusion protein): Facilitates membrane fusion and viral entry; activates TLR-4 signaling. M2: Encodes two proteins (M2-1 and M2-2) involved in transcription regulation. L (large polymerase protein): RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Replication: RSV replication involves a complementary antigenome RNA that serves as a template for genome synthesis. Both genome and antigenome lack 5′ caps and 3′ polyA tails but are encapsidated by N protein to protect from degradation and immune detection. Genetic Variability: RSV exists as two major subgroups, RSV A and RSV B, which differ in genetic sequences, especially in the G (attachment) and F (fusion) proteins. RSV A generally has a higher mutation density and genetic diversity than RSV B. Both subgroups show numerous synonymous and missense mutations, with the attachment glycoprotein gene exhibiting the highest variability. These mutations contribute to viral evolution, epidemic potential, and challenges in vaccine development. Structural Insights: RSV particles can be spherical, filamentous, or asymmetric, with a consistent organization of surface glycoproteins and internal proteins such as M and M2-1, which influence virus assembly and infectivity Doctor-patient conversation about Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Doctor: \"Hello, I understand you’re concerned about your symptoms. Based on your exam and the season, it looks like you have an infection caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus, or RSV.\" Patient: \"What exactly is RSV? Is it serious?\" Doctor: \"RSV is a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in most people. For healthy adults, it usually causes mild illness. However, in infants, older adults, or people with lung or heart conditions, it can cause more serious breathing problems like bronchiolitis or pneumonia.\" Patient: \"How did I get it? Is it contagious?\" Doctor: \"Yes, RSV spreads easily through coughs, sneezes, or touching contaminated surfaces. It’s very common in the fall and winter months when respiratory viruses circulate more.\" Patient: \"Do I need antibiotics?\" Doctor: \"No, RSV is caused by a virus, so antibiotics won’t help. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms—rest, fluids, and if needed, medications for fever or pain. If your breathing becomes difficult or you feel worse, please come back.\" Patient: \"How long will it last?\" Doctor: \"Most people recover in one to two weeks. Some symptoms like cough may linger longer, but you should gradually feel better.\" Patient: \"Is there a vaccine or prevention?\" Doctor: \"There are vaccines and monoclonal antibodies available for high-risk groups like infants and older adults to prevent severe RSV. For most people, good hand hygiene and avoiding close contact with sick individuals help reduce risk.\" Patient: \"Thank you, doctor. I’ll take care and watch my symptoms.\" Doctor: \"That’s good. If you have any concerns or your symptoms worsen, don’t hesitate to contact us.\" REFERENCES RSV Symptoms, Causes & Treatment Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - Symptoms & causes - Mayo Clinic Symptoms and Care of RSV | RSV | CDC https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459215/#article-28424.s10 Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Alternative Names for Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Pertussis (medical term) Whooping Cough (common name) 100-day Cough (historical term, reflecting prolonged cough duration) Bordetella pertussis infection (refers to the causative bacterium) Paroxysmal Cough (describes the characteristic coughing fits) DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Whooping cough is an illness that can spread easily. It\\'s also called pertussis. An infection with bacteria causes it. Many people with the illness get a serious hacking cough. Breathing in after coughing often causes a high-pitched noise that sounds like a \"whoop.\" Before the vaccine for pertussis came out, whooping cough was thought of as a childhood disease. Today, whooping cough mainly affects children too young to have gotten all their shots of the vaccine. The illness also tends to affect teenagers and adults whose protection from the vaccine has faded. Deaths linked with whooping cough are rare. Most often, they occur in infants. But pregnant people can help protect their babies by getting a booster shot of the vaccine during pregnancy. Vaccination also is recommended for other people who will have close contact with an infant. Causes OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) A type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, tiny germ-filled droplets spray into the air. Anyone who happens to be nearby can breathe in the droplets. The bacteria that cause whooping cough also can spread when people are together for a long time. Or these germs can spread when people share breathing space, such as while holding a newborn on your chest. Risk factors OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) The whooping cough vaccine you receive as a child wears off over time. This leaves many teenagers and adults prone to the infection during an outbreak. And regular outbreaks still happen. Certain infants are most at risk for serious health problems and death from whooping cough. These include babies younger than 12 months old who are not vaccinated or haven\\'t received all their vaccine doses. Symptoms OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Once you become infected with whooping cough, it takes about 5 to 10 days for symptoms to start. Sometimes it takes up to three weeks. The symptoms often are mild at first. They may seem like those of a common cold. They can include: Runny or stuffy nose. Red, watery eyes. Fever. Cough. After a week or two, the symptoms become worse. Thick mucus builds up inside the airways. This causes rapid coughing that can\\'t be controlled. The cough can last for weeks or months, and it may be worse at night. Intense coughing attacks may cause: Vomiting. A red or blue face. Extreme tiredness. A high-pitched \"whoop\" sound during the next breath of air. People with mild illnesses often don\\'t make the whooping sound. Sometimes, an ongoing hacking cough is the only symptom of whooping cough in teens and adults. Many babies with the illness don\\'t cough at all. Some babies and young children might. Gag or struggle to breathe. Have skin, lips or nails that turn blue or purple. Have life-threatening pauses in breathing called apnea. Stages of whooping cough The three stages of whooping cough are: Common cold symptoms Coughing fits Gradual recovery Stage 1: Common cold symptoms This stage lasts about one to two weeks. You or your child is most contagious during this time, but you might think it’s just a cold. Symptoms include: Stuffy nose Runny nose Sore throat Watery eyes Mild or occasional cough that gradually gets worse Low-grade fever (under 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit/38 degrees Celsius) or normal temperature Feeling generally unwell or “off” (malaise) Infants may struggle to breathe or have pauses in their breathing (apnea). You might notice: Your baby is working hard to breathe. Their stomach seems to be caving in or breathing looks like they’re panting. Their skin or area around their mouth is turning blue or gray from lack of oxygen (cyanosis) Stage 2: Coughing fits The second stage usually lasts anywhere from one to six weeks. But it sometimes lasts as long as 10 weeks. During this stage, you have thick mucus in your airways and severe coughing fits (paroxysms). Here’s what to expect: A coughing fit means you cough many times in a row for several minutes. When you try to catch your breath between coughs, you may make a high-pitched “whoop” sound. You may vomit and/or feel exhausted after a coughing fit. Crying, eating or laughing may trigger a coughing fit. Coughing fits occur during the day and night but may get worse at night. Coughing fits get more frequent before leveling off and then gradually going down in number. Stage 3: Gradual recovery This stage lasts up to six weeks. During this time, you may have a mild cough that comes and goes, but you won’t have severe coughing fits like before. You’ll gradually cough less and less. Even as you start to feel better, you’re more vulnerable to other respiratory infections during this time. Your body is still healing. Try to avoid exposure to germs. If you do get sick with something else, the coughing fits may return. Whooping cough sound Whooping cough gets its name from the “whoop” sound that some people make after coughing. If you’re coughing over and over, it can be difficult to catch your breath. When you finally take in some air, your efforts may come across as a high-pitched “whoop” or gasp. But not everyone with pertussis develops a “whoop sound.” When to see a doctor Call your healthcare professional if ongoing coughing spells cause you or your child to: Vomit. Turn red, purple or blue. Breathe in with a whooping sound. Not drink enough fluid. Call 911 or your local emergency number right away if you or your child seems to struggle to breathe. Also call for emergency care if you notice pauses in breathing. Diagnosis OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) It may take time to find out if you have whooping cough. The symptoms can seem like those of other common illnesses, such as a common cold or the flu. Sometimes, healthcare professionals can determine that you have whooping cough by asking about your symptoms and doing a physical exam. But you may need medical tests such as: A nose or throat culture and test. Your healthcare professional takes a mucus sample from the back of the throat, where the nose and throat meet. The sample is checked for signs of whooping cough bacteria. Blood tests. A blood sample may be taken and sent to a lab. The lab checks for certain proteins called antibodies that the body makes to fight infections. This is a general test and not specific for whooping cough. A chest X-ray. This test may be recommended to check for signs of pneumonia due to whooping cough. Treatment OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Most often, infants need treatment in the hospital for whooping cough. That\\'s because the illness is more dangerous for babies. If your child can\\'t keep down liquids or food, fluids given through a vein may be needed. Your child is cared for away from others. This prevents the infection from spreading. Treatment for older children and adults often can be given at home, since the illness tends to be milder. Medications OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Antibiotics kill the bacteria that causes whooping cough. When you take them early, they might make your illness less serious. They also may shorten the amount of time you\\'re at risk of spreading the illness. If you live with other people, they may be given antibiotics to help prevent them from getting sick. Not much is available to relieve the cough itself. Cough medicines that are sold without a prescription, for instance, do not help treat whooping cough. Do not take them unless your healthcare professional tells you to. Self-care OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) The following tips can help you deal with coughing spells while you recover from whooping cough at home: Get plenty of rest. A cool, quiet and dark bedroom may help you relax and rest better. Drink plenty of fluids. Water, juice and soups are good choices. Be aware of dehydration symptoms, especially if your child is sick. The symptoms include dry lips, crying without tears and urinating much less often. Eat smaller meals. To help prevent vomiting after coughing, eat smaller, more-frequent meals rather than large ones. Clean the air. Keep your home free of irritants that can trigger coughing spells. These include dust, tobacco smoke and fumes from fireplaces. Prevent the spread of whooping cough. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or the inside of your elbow. Throw away used tissues right away. Wash your hands often and for at least 20 seconds. If you must be around others, wear a mask. Stay home from work or school until you\\'ve completed at least five days of treatment. If a young child is sick, keep the child home from daycare until finishing five days of treatment. If you don\\'t get treatment, it\\'s safest to stay away from others for three weeks after your symptoms start. Your body gets rid of the bacteria by then, even though you may still have symptoms. Whooping Cough (Pertussis) — Treatment Drugs and Their Side Effects 1. Preferred Antibiotics for Treatment and Prophylaxis Macrolides: Azithromycin Dosing: Infants >6 months & adults: 5-day course (500 mg day 1, then 250 mg daily days 2–5) Children: weight-based dosing (10 mg/kg day 1, then 5 mg/kg days 2–5) Side Effects: Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain), rare allergic reactions, possible QT prolongation. Clarithromycin Dosing: Children >6 months: 15 mg/kg/day divided twice daily for 7 days Adults: 500 mg twice daily for 7 days Side Effects: GI upset, taste disturbances, liver enzyme elevation, drug interactions. Not recommended in pregnancy. Erythromycin Dosing: Infants: 40–50 mg/kg/day divided into 4 doses for 14 days Adults: 2 g/day divided into 4 doses for 14 days Side Effects: GI upset (especially abdominal cramping and diarrhea), risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in neonates, liver toxicity, drug interactions. Estolate formulation preferred in children but avoided in adults and pregnant women. Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX): Alternative for those intolerants to macrolides. Dosing: Children >2 months: 8 mg TMP/40 mg SMX/kg/day divided twice daily for 14 days Adults: 320 mg TMP/1600 mg SMX daily divided twice daily for 14 days Side Effects: Allergic reactions, rash, photosensitivity, hematologic effects (rare), not recommended in pregnancy or infants <2 months. 2. Treatment Timing and Considerations Antibiotics are most effective when started within the first 1–2 weeks of cough onset to reduce severity and transmission. After 3 weeks, antibiotics do not change the course but may still be given to infants and pregnant women up to 6 weeks after onset. Early treatment reduces contagiousness after 5 days of antibiotics. 3. Supportive Care Rest, hydration, and avoiding cough irritants (smoke, dust). Cough medicines are generally ineffective and not recommended. Hospitalization may be required for severe cases, especially infants. Complications OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Teens and adults often recover from whooping cough with no problems. When other health conditions happen, they tend to be side effects of intense coughing, such as: Bruised or cracked ribs. Tissue that bulges through a weak spot in the muscles of the stomach area, called an abdominal hernia. Broken blood vessels in the skin or the whites of the eyes. Teens and adults also can have: Loss of bladder control. Weight loss. Fainting. Infants Health conditions that can happen with whooping cough are more serious in infants, especially those under 6 months of age. They can include: The lung infection pneumonia. Ear infection. Slowed or stopped breathing. Dehydration or weight loss due to trouble feeding. Seizures. Brain damage. Infants and toddlers have the highest risk of other health conditions due to whooping cough. So, they\\'re more likely to need treatment for these in a hospital. Health conditions due to whooping cough can be life-threatening for infants younger than 6 months old. Prevention OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) The best way to prevent whooping cough is with the pertussis vaccine. It\\'s often given together with vaccines against two other serious diseases: diphtheria and tetanus. Healthcare professionals recommend starting vaccination during infancy. The vaccine is a series of five shots. You might hear it called DTaP. It\\'s most often given to children at these ages: 2 months. 4 months. 6 months. 15 to 18 months. 4 to 6 years. Vaccine side effects Most often, side effects of the vaccine are mild. They may include a fever, crankiness, headache, fatigue or soreness at the site of the shot. Booster shots Booster shots strengthen the body\\'s defenses against whooping cough. They help protect against whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus. You might hear your healthcare professional call your booster shot Tdap. It\\'s recommended for the following people. Pre-teens. Protection from the pertussis vaccine tends to fade by age 11. So, healthcare professionals recommend a shot of Tdap at 11 or 12 years old. Pregnant women. Health experts now recommend getting a shot of Tdap between 27 and 36 weeks of each pregnancy. This also may give some protection to an infant during the first few months of life. Adults. Sometimes, Tdap is given instead of a booster shot for tetanus and diphtheria. The tetanus and diphtheria booster shot is recommended for adults every 10 years. If you\\'re due for that shot and you\\'ve never received Tdap before, your healthcare professional likely will give you Tdap instead. That\\'s because Tdap protects against all three diseases. In general, adults who never received the Tdap booster shot can get one at any time. It\\'s key to make sure you\\'re up to date on your shots at least two weeks before you get close to a baby. The vaccine lowers your risk of spreading whooping cough to infants. Preventive medications If you or your infant has been exposed to someone with whooping cough, talk with your healthcare professional. Medicines called antibiotics may be recommended to protect against infection if you: Are a healthcare professional. Are pregnant. Are younger than 12 months old. Have a health condition that could put you at risk of serious illness or complications. This includes conditions such as a weakened immune system or asthma. Live with someone who has whooping cough. Live with someone who is at high risk of serious illness or complications from a whooping cough infection. This includes babies and pregnant women. Outlook / Prognosis OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Whooping cough can make you feel miserable for weeks or months. And it’s possible to develop severe complications. The good news is that your body will likely build up some immunity against Bordetella pertussis bacteria. So, you won’t get whooping cough again for a while — anywhere from four to 20 years, according to some experts. But you can get whooping cough again in the future once immunity wanes. Your child might need to stay in the hospital, especially if they’re very young. When is it safe to return to daycare, school or work? It depends. If you or your child is taking antibiotics, it’s generally safe to return after five full days of treatment. Otherwise, you’re still contagious for three weeks after the start of the coughing fits. Is there anything I can do to feel better? Things you can do to feel a little better — and possibly ease coughing at night — include: Take some honey. This may help calm your cough. But it’s only safe for adults and kids over age 1. Never give honey to an infant (because of the risk of botulism). Rest. Getting lots of rest helps your body heal. Keep up the fluids. Drinking plenty of fluids can help thin the mucus that’s making you cough. Use a cool-mist humidifier. This helps break up mucus. Eat small meals. Eating just a small amount of food at a time may keep you from vomiting. Avoid irritants. Things like dust, smoke and chemical fumes (for example, from some cleaning supplies) might make you cough. Diagnostic Considerations OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Illnesses that mimic clinical pertussis include the following: Adenoviral respiratory infection - Children present with fever, sore throat, and conjunctivitis Mycoplasmal pneumonia - Patients with mycoplasmal infections have more pronounced systemic symptoms, fever and headache may occur, and rales may be appreciated on chest auscultation Chlamydial pneumonia - young infants with chlamydial infections present with staccato cough, purulent conjunctival discharge, tachypnea, rales, and wheezing Respiratory syncytial virus infection - Patients present with predominantly lower respiratory tract signs (eg, wheezing, rales) Other conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis of pertussis include the following: Common cold Influenza Cystic fibrosis Interstitial pneumonitis Bronchiolitis Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis) Dehydration Febrile Seizures Fever Gastroenteritis Intussusception Tachycardia Aspiration pneumonia Bacterial pneumonia Viral pneumonia Tuberculosis Differential Diagnoses OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Afebrile Pneumonia Syndrome Asthma Bronchiolitis Chlamydia (Chlamydial Genitourinary Infections) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Emphysema in Emergency Medicine Emergent Treatment of Gastroenteritis Encephalitis Pediatric Mycoplasma Infections Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Trachea Foreign Bodies Epidemiology OF Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Occurrence in the United States Since the early 1980s, pertussis incidence has cyclically increased, with peaks occurring every 2-5 years. Most cases occur between June and September. Neither acquisition of the disease nor vaccination provides complete or lifelong immunity. Protection against typical disease wanes 3-5 years after vaccination and is not measurable after 12 years. The rate of pertussis peaked in the 1930s, with 265,269 cases and 7518 deaths reported in the United States. This rate decreased to a low of 1010 cases in the United States, with 4 deaths, in 1976. Starting in the 1980s, however, the reported incidence of US pertussis cases dramatically increased across all age groups. Although the largest increase in pertussis cases has been among adolescents and adults, the annual reported incidence has been highest among infants younger than 1 year. In 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US pertussis rate reached 27,550 cases (the highest number since 1959), with 27 related deaths. In 2011, according to preliminary statistics from the CDC, adolescents (ages 11-19 years) and adults together accounted for 47% of pertussis cases, whereas children aged 7-10 years accounted for 18% of cases. According to the CDC, during the first half of 2012, most states had reported either increased pertussis activity or outbreaks of the disease. By July 5 of that year, 37 states had reported increases in pertussis cases over those reported during the same period in 2011. For example, as listed by the CDC and the states’ health departments, the number of reported cases in Washington State (where a pertussis epidemic was declared), Minnesota, and Wisconsin in 2012 were as follows: Washington State - 2012: 3400 cases reported through Aug 4; 2011: 287 cases reported through Aug 4 Minnesota - 2012: 2039 cases reported as of Aug 2; 2011 (entire year): 661 cases reported Wisconsin - 2012: 3496 confirmed or probable cases reported through July 31, 2012; 2011 (entire year): 1192 confirmed or probable cases reported The CDC listed a provisional national figure of 17,000 pertussis cases between Jan 1 and July 21, 2012, including 9 pertussis-related deaths. The reasons that pertussis cases peak in some years is not completely understood, according to the CDC. The CDC has estimated that 5-10% of all cases of pertussis are recognized and reported. Pertussis remains the most commonly reported vaccine-preventable disease in the United States in children younger than 5 years. In studies, 12-32% of adults with prolonged (1-4 wks.) cough have been found to have pertussis. Between January 1, 2014, and June 10, 2014, California\\'s public health department reported 3,458 cases of pertussis. The department declared the outbreak to have reached epidemic proportions, with 800 cases reported in the span of just 2 weeks. A study that examined a similar outbreak in California in 2010 determined that nonmedical vaccine exemptions played a role. Nationally, the CDC stated that the 4,838 cases of pertussis reported from January 1, 2014, to April 14, 2014, represented a 24% increase over the same period in 2013. The CDC reports that during January 1–November 26, 2014, a total of 9,935 cases of pertussis with onset in 2014 were reported in California. Severe and fatal disease occurs almost exclusively in infants who are too young to be vaccinated against pertussis. Therefore, pregnant women are encouraged to receive tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) during the third trimester of each pregnancy to provide placental transfer of maternal antibodies to the infant. International occurrence The annual worldwide incidence of pertussis is estimated to be 48.5 million cases, with a mortality rate of nearly 295,000 deaths per year. The case-fatality rate among infants in low-income countries may be as high as 4%. In England, the percentage of people vaccinated for pertussis over the last 4 decades has decreased to less than 30%. This decline has resulted in thousands of recently reported cases of the disease, with the incidence rate approaching that of the pre vaccination era. Similar epidemic outbreaks recently have occurred in Sweden, Canada, and Germany. Nearly 300,000 deaths from pertussis are thought to have occurred in Africa over the last decade. Race- and sex-related demographics With regard to race, the CDC reported that among individuals with pertussis between 2001 and 2003, 90% were white, 7% were black, 1% were Asian/Pacific Islander, and 1% were American Indian/Alaska Native, and 1% were identified as “other race”. From 2001-2003, females accounted for 54% of pertussis cases in the United States. Age-related demographics From 2001-2003 of patients with pertussis, 23% were younger than 1 year, 12% were aged 1-4 years, 9% were aged 5-9 years, 33% were aged 10-19 years, and 23% were older than 20 years. Because of the lack of maternal immunity transfer, 10-15% of all cases of pertussis occur in infants younger than 6 months; more than 90% of all deaths occur in this same age group. However, the growing majority of cases now are in persons aged 10 years and older, which has led to increased booster recommendations. Genomic Data of Whooping Cough (Pertussis) — Bordetella pertussis Genome Structure: Bordetella pertussis has a circular chromosome approximately 4.1 million base pairs (bp) in length (e.g., 4,124,236 bp in strain CS) with a high G+C content of about 67.3%. Gene Content: The genome encodes roughly 3,400 to 3,900 protein-coding sequences (CDSs), depending on the strain, with an average protein size of around 327 amino acids. It also contains multiple copies of insertion sequence IS481, a mobile genetic element presents in high numbers (over 200 copies), which plays a role in genome rearrangements and deletions. Genomic Variation and Evolution: Despite vaccination, pertussis has resurged in many countries, partly due to pathogen adaptation and genome evolution. Comparative genomics of hundreds of isolates reveal: Low nucleotide diversity: B. pertussis is considered a highly monomorphic pathogen with few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between strains. Structural rearrangements: Large-scale chromosomal rearrangements mediated by IS481 elements alter gene order and may affect gene expression, potentially contributing to vaccine escape and epidemiological changes. Virulence gene variation: Mutations and deletions in key antigen genes such as pertactin (prn) and pertussis toxin promoter (ptxP) have been observed, with some circulating strains being pertactin-deficient, which may provide a fitness advantage Whooping Cough (Pertussis) — Predefined Questions and Answers Q1. What is whooping cough? A. Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It causes severe coughing fits that can make it hard to breathe. Q2. How does whooping cough spread? A. It spreads through droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Close contact with someone who has pertussis increases the risk of catching it. Q3. What are the symptoms of whooping cough? A. Early symptoms resemble a common cold: runny nose, sneezing, mild cough, and low-grade fever. After 1–2 weeks, severe coughing fits develop, often followed by a “whooping” sound when inhaling. Q4. Who is most at risk for severe disease? A. Infants under 1 year old, especially those not fully vaccinated, are at highest risk. Older adults and people with weakened immune systems can also have severe illness. Q5. How is whooping cough diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is made based on symptoms and confirmed by laboratory tests such as PCR or culture from a nasal swab. Q6. What treatments are available? A. Antibiotics such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin are used to treat pertussis and reduce transmission. Supportive care includes rest, fluids, and monitoring for breathing difficulties. Q7. Can whooping cough be prevented? A. Yes. Vaccination is the best prevention. The DTaP vaccine is given to children, and Tdap boosters are recommended for adolescents and adults, especially pregnant women. Q8. How long is someone contagious? A. People are contagious from the start of cold-like symptoms until about 5 days after starting appropriate antibiotics. Without treatment, they can be contagious for up to 3 weeks after coughing begins. Q9. When should I seek medical care? A. Seek care if coughing spells cause difficulty breathing, vomiting, or if an infant shows signs of distress, poor feeding, or apnea (pauses in breathing). Q10. What complications can occur? A. Complications include pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and in severe cases, death—especially in infants. Doctor-patient conversation about Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Doctor: \"Hello, I understand your child has been having a persistent cough. Based on the symptoms and examination, it looks like your child may have whooping cough, also called pertussis.\" Parent: \"What exactly is whooping cough? Why is it called that?\" Doctor: \"Whooping cough is a contagious respiratory infection caused by bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. It gets its name from the characteristic \\'whoop\\' sound children make when they gasp for air after a severe coughing fit. The cough can be very intense and last for weeks.\" Parent: \"How does it start and how long does it last?\" Doctor: \"It usually begins like a common cold with a runny nose, sneezing, mild cough, and sometimes a low fever. After one to two weeks, the cough worsens and comes in violent fits. These coughing spells can cause vomiting, redness in the face, and sometimes a whooping sound. This stage can last from two to eight weeks, and the cough may persist for up to 100 days, which is why it\\'s sometimes called the \\'100-day cough.\\'\" Parent: \"Is it dangerous? What should I watch for?\" Doctor: \"Infants and young children are at highest risk for complications like pneumonia, difficulty breathing, or even seizures. Watch for signs like difficulty breathing, turning blue around the lips, poor feeding, or extreme tiredness. If you see any of these, seek medical care immediately.\" Parent: \"How is it treated?\" Doctor: \"We treat whooping cough with antibiotics, which help reduce the contagiousness and can be most effective if started early. Supportive care like rest, fluids, and monitoring breathing is important. Sometimes hospitalization is needed for severe cases.\" Parent: \"Can it be prevented?\" Doctor: \"Yes, vaccination is the best prevention. Children receive the DTaP vaccine, and adults and pregnant women get booster shots called Tdap to protect themselves and their babies.\" Parent: \"How contagious is it? How can I protect others?\" Doctor: \"Whooping cough spreads easily through coughing or sneezing. Your child is contagious from the start of symptoms until about five days after starting antibiotics. Good hand hygiene, avoiding close contact with others, and completing the full course of antibiotics help prevent spread.\" Parent: \"Thank you, doctor. What should I do if the cough gets worse?\" Doctor: \"If your child\\'s coughing spells become more severe, if they have trouble breathing, or if they stop feeding well, please come back immediately. We will monitor closely and adjust care as needed.\" REFERENCES Whooping cough - Diagnosis & treatment - Mayo Clinic Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Symptoms & Treatment Pertussis (Whooping Cough) | Whooping Cough | CDC https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/967268-workup TUBERCULOSIS DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF TUBERCULOSIS Tuberculosis, also called TB, is a serious illness that mainly affects the lungs. The germs that cause tuberculosis are a type of bacteria. Tuberculosis can spread when a person with the illness coughs, sneezes or sings. This can put tiny droplets with the germs into the air. Another person can then breathe in the droplets, and the germs enter the lungs. Tuberculosis spreads easily where people gather in crowds or where people live in crowded conditions. People with HIV/AIDS and other people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk of catching tuberculosis than people with typical immune systems. Medicines called antibiotics can treat tuberculosis. But some forms of the bacteria no longer respond well to treatments. Causes OF TUBERCULOSIS Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. People with active TB disease in the lungs or voice box can spread the disease. They release tiny droplets that carry the bacteria through the air. This can happen when they\\'re speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or sneezing. A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets. The disease is more likely to spread when people spend a lot of time together in an indoor space. So the disease spreads easily in places where people live or work together for long periods. Also, the disease spreads more easily in crowded gatherings. A person with a latent TB infection cannot pass the disease to other people. A person taking medicine to treat active TB disease usually can\\'t pass the disease after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment. Drug-resistant TB Some forms of the TB bacteria have become drug resistant. This means that medicines that once cured the disease no longer work. This happens, in part, because of naturally occurring genetic changes in bacteria. A random genetic change in a bacterium might give it some quality that makes it more likely to survive the attack of an antibiotic. If it does survive, then it can multiply. When antibiotic medicines aren\\'t used correctly — or medicines fail to clear out all the bacteria for another reason — the conditions are ideal for more-resistant versions of the bacteria to take hold and multiply. If these bacteria are passed on to other people, a new drug-resistant strain can grow over time. Problems that can lead to such drug-resistant strains of bacteria include the following: People didn\\'t follow directions for taking the medicines or stopped taking the medicines. They weren\\'t prescribed the right treatment plan. Medicines were not available. The medicines were of poor quality. The body didn’t absorb the medicines as expected. Risk factors OF TUBERCULOSIS Anyone can get tuberculosis, but certain factors increase the risk of getting an infection. Other factors increase the risk of an infection becoming active TB disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a TB test for people who have an increased risk of TB infection or active TB disease. Talk to your healthcare professional if you have one or more of the following risk factors. Risk of TB infection Certain living or working conditions make it easier for the disease to pass from one person to another. These conditions increase the risk of getting a TB infection: Living with someone with active TB disease. Living or traveling in a country where TB is common, including several countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands. Living or working in places where people live close together, such as prisons, nursing homes and shelters for homeless people. Living in a community identified as being at high risk of tuberculosis. Working in healthcare and treating people with a high risk of TB. Risk of active TB disease A weakened immune system increases the risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease. Conditions or treatments that weaken the immune system include: HIV/AIDS. Diabetes. Severe kidney disease. Cancers of the head, neck and blood. Malnutrition or low body weight. Cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy. Medicine to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. Long-term use of prescription steroids. Use of unlawful injected drugs. Misuse of alcohol. Smoking and using other tobacco products. Age and active TB disease The risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease changes with age. Under 5 years of age. Until children reach age 5, they have high risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease. The risk is greater for children under age 2. Tuberculosis in this age group often leads to serious disease in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal column, called meningitis. Age 15 to 25. People in this age group have an increased risk of developing more-severe active TB disease in the lungs. Age 65 and older. The immune system weakens during older age. Older adults have a greater risk of active TB disease. Also, the disease may be more difficult to treat. Symptoms OF TUBERCULOSIS When TB germs survive and multiply in the lungs, it is called a TB infection. A TB infection may be in one of three stages. Symptoms are different in each stage. Primary TB infection. The first stage is called the primary infection. Immune system cells find and capture the germs. The immune system may completely destroy the germs. But some captured germs may still survive and multiply. Most people don\\'t have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may get flu-like symptoms, such as: Low fever. Tiredness. Cough. Latent TB infection. Primary infection is usually followed by the stage called latent TB infection. Immune system cells build a wall around lung tissue with TB germs. The germs can\\'t do any more harm if the immune system keeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during latent TB infection. Active TB disease. Active TB disease happens when the immune system can\\'t control an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body. Active TB disease may happen right after primary infection. But it usually happens after months or years of latent TB infection. Symptoms of active TB disease in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks. They may include: Cough. Coughing up blood or mucus. Chest pain. Pain with breathing or coughing. Fever. Chills. Night sweats. Weight loss. Not wanting to eat. Tiredness. Not feeling well in general. Active TB disease outside the lungs. TB infection can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body. This is called extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms vary depending on what part of the body is infected. Common symptoms may include: Fever. Chills. Night sweats. Weight loss. Not wanting to eat. Tiredness. Not feeling well in general. Pain near the site of infection. Active TB disease in the voice box is outside the lungs, but it has symptoms more like disease in the lungs. Common sites of active TB disease outside the lungs include: Kidneys. Liver. Fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Heart muscles. Genitals. Lymph nodes. Bones and joints. Skin. Walls of blood vessels. Voice box, also called larynx. Active TB disease in children. Symptoms of active TB disease in children vary. Typically, symptoms by age may include the following: Teenagers. Symptoms are similar to adult symptoms. 1- to 12-year-olds. Younger children may have a fever that won\\'t go away and weight loss. Infants.The baby doesn\\'t grow or gain weight as expected. Also, a baby may have symptoms from swelling in the fluid around the brain or spinal cord, including: Being sluggish or not active. Unusually fussy. Vomiting. Poor feeding. Bulging soft spot on the head. Poor reflexes. When to see a doctor The symptoms of tuberculosis are similar to symptoms of many different illnesses. See your healthcare professional if you have symptoms that don\\'t improve with a few days of rest. Get emergency care if you have: Chest pain. Sudden, severe headache. Confusion. Seizures. Difficulty breathing. Get immediate or urgent care if you: Cough up blood. Have blood in your urine or stool. Diagnosis OF TUBERCULOSIS To diagnosis a tuberculosis (TB) infection, your healthcare professional will do an exam that includes: Listening to you breathe with a stethoscope. Checking for swollen lymph nodes. Asking you questions about your symptoms. TB tests Your healthcare professional will order tests if: Tuberculosis is suspected. You were likely exposed to a person with active TB disease. You have health risks for active TB disease. Your healthcare team will determine whether a skin test or blood test is the best option. Skin test A tiny amount of a substance called tuberculin is injected just below the skin on the inside of one forearm. Within 48 to 72 hours, a healthcare worker will check your arm for swelling at the injection site. The size of the raised skin is used to determine a positive or negative test. This test is seeing if your immune system reacts, or has made an antibody, to tuberculosis. A positive test indicates you likely have either a latent TB infection or active TB disease. People who had a TB vaccination might get a positive test even if they have no infection. A negative test means that your body didn\\'t react to the test. It doesn\\'t necessarily mean you don\\'t have an infection. Blood tests A sample of blood is sent to a lab. One lab test finds out whether certain immune system cells can \"recognize\" tuberculosis. A positive test shows that you have either a latent TB infection or active TB disease. Other tests of the blood sample can help determine if you have active disease. A negative result means you likely do not have a TB infection. X-ray A chest X-ray can show irregular patches in the lungs that are typical of active TB disease. Sputum tests Your healthcare professional may take a sample of the mucus that comes up when you cough, also called sputum. If you have active TB disease in your lungs or voice box, lab tests can detect the bacteria. A relatively quick laboratory test can tell if the sputum likely has the TB bacteria. But it may be showing bacteria with similar features. Another lab test can confirm the presence of TB bacteria. The results often take several weeks. A lab test also can tell if it\\'s a drug-resistant form of the bacteria. This information helps your healthcare professional choose the best treatment. Other lab tests Other lab tests that may be ordered include: Breath test. Procedure to remove sputum from your lungs with a special tube. Urine test. Test of the fluid around the spine and brain, called cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment OF TUBERCULOSIS If you have a latent TB infection, your healthcare professional may begin treatments. This is especially true for people with HIV/AIDS or other factors that increase the risk of active TB disease. Most latent TB infections are treated for three or four months. Active TB disease may be treated for four, six or nine months. Specialists in TB treatment will determine which medicines are best for you. You will have regular appointments to see if you\\'re improving and to watch for side effects. Take all of the medicines It is important to take every dose as instructed. And you must complete the full course of treatment. This is important for killing the bacteria in your body and preventing new drug-resistant bacteria. Your public health department may use a program called directly observed therapy (DOT). With DOT, a healthcare worker visits you at home to watch you take your dose of medicines. Some healthcare departments have programs that let you take your medicines on your own. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has printable forms you can use to keep track of your daily doses. Most common TB medicines If you have a latent TB infection, you might need to take only one or two types of medicines. Active TB disease requires taking several medicines. Common ones used to treat tuberculosis include: Isoniazid. Rifampin (Rimactane). Rifabutin (Mycobutin). Rifapentine (Priftin). Pyrazinamide. Ethambutol (Myambutol). You may be prescribed other medicines if you have drug-resistant tuberculosis or other complications from your illness. Medication side effects Most people can take TB medicines without serious side effects. If you have serious side effects, your healthcare professional may ask you to stop taking a medicine. You may have to change the dose of a medicine. Talk to your healthcare professional if you experience any of the following: Upset stomach. Vomiting. Loss of appetite. Severe diarrhea. Light-colored stool. Dark urine. Yellowish skin or eye color. Changes in vision. Dizziness or trouble with balance. Tingling in hands or feet. Easy bruising or bleeding. Unexplained weight loss. Unexplained tiredness. Sadness or depression. Rash. Joint pain. It is important for you to list all medicines, dietary supplements or herbal remedies you take. You may need to stop taking some of these during your treatment. Prevention OF TUBERCULOSIS If you test positive for latent TB infection, you may need to take medicines to prevent active TB disease. Preventing the spread of disease If you have active TB disease, you\\'ll need to take steps to prevent other people from getting an infection. You will take medicines for four, six or nine months. Take all of the medicines as directed during the entire time. During the first 2 to 3 weeks, you will be able to pass TB bacteria to others. Protect others with these steps: Stay home. Don\\'t go to work or school. Isolate at home. Spend as little time as possible among members of your household. Sleep in a separate room. Ventilate the room. Tuberculosis germs spread more easily in small, closed spaces. If it\\'s not too cold outdoors, open the windows. Use a fan to blow air out. If you have more than one window, use one fan to blow air out and another to blow air in. Wear face masks. Wear a mask when you have to be around other people. Ask other members of the household to wear masks to protect themselves. Cover your mouth. Use a tissue to cover your mouth anytime you sneeze or cough. Put the dirty tissue in a bag, seal it and throw it away. Vaccinations In countries where tuberculosis is common, infants often are vaccinated with the bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. This protects infants and toddlers who are more likely to have active TB disease in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The vaccine may not protect against disease in the lungs, which is more likely in the United States. Dozens of new TB vaccines are in various stages of development and testing. PROGNOSIS OF TUBERCULOSIS The cure rate for patients with drug-susceptible TB who can complete a therapeutic regimen can exceed 95%. Variables such as disease extent, delay in treatment, comorbidities, age, the need for mechanical ventilation, drug resistance, and adverse drug reactions influence the therapy outcome. Novel regimens will likely improve outcomes in people treated for drug-resistant TB. The WHO 2018 global estimates of successful treatment outcomes are as follows: 85% for people with new and relapsed TB 76% of HIV-coinfected people 57% for people with MDR-TB More than 80% of TB-associated mortality occurs in LMICs. In 2022, the WHO estimated 1.13 million deaths among HIV-negative people and 167,000 deaths among PLHIV. TB is the leading cause of death in PLHIV. The WHO estimates that 15% of patients with MDR-TB die of disease, and 26% of those deaths are due to XDR-TB. The current estimate of the prognosis of untreated TB is difficult to calculate; it would have to account for regional differences in healthcare resources, those who have either failed or never initiated treatment, those with drug-resistant strains, and people with different underlying comorbidities. Estimates based on pre-chemotherapy era data may be unreliable due to case definition, patient selection, and reporting heterogeneity. The study by Tiemersma, et al estimated a 70% lifetime case fatality among untreated HIV-negative individuals Diagnostic Considerations OF TUBERCULOSIS Tuberculosis (TB) is well known for its ability to masquerade as other infectious and disease processes. For example, congenital TB can mimic congenital syphilis or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Along with the differentials listed in the next section, conditions with a presentation that may resemble pulmonary TB include the following: Blastomycosis Tularemia Actinomycosis Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection M chelonae infection M fortuitum infection M gordonae infection M kansasii infection M marinum infection M xenopi infection Squamous cell carcinoma Conditions to be included in the differential diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB include the following: Blastomycosis Tularemia Actinomycosis Hidradenitis suppurativa Eosinophilic granuloma M avium-intracellulare infection M chelonae infection M fortuitum infection M gordonae infection M kansasii infection M marinum infection M xenopi infection Endemic syphilis Erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis) Erythema nodosum Leishmaniasis Leprosy Cat scratch disease Syphilis Syringoma Rheumatoid arthritis Dermatologic differential diagnosis OF TUBERCULOSIS Diagnosis of skin infection with M tuberculosis involves the following: Differentiate primary-inoculation TB from ulceroglandular complexes and mycobacteriosis Differentiate TB verrucosa cutis from diseases such as North American blastomycosis, chromoblastomycosis, iododerma and bromoderma, chronic vegetative pyoderma, verruca vulgaris, verrucous carcinoma, verrucous atypical mycobacterial infection, and verrucous lupus vulgaris Differentiate miliary TB of the skin (which appears as small, non characteristic, erythematous, papular, or purpuric lesions) from drug reactions. Differentiate scrofuloderma from suppurative lymphadenitis with sinus-tract formation, such as blastomycosis or coccidioidomycosis. Differentiate TB cutis orificialis from glossitis, apotheosis, and deep fungal infections. Differentiate lupus vulgaris from lupoid rosacea, deep fungal or atypical mycobacterial infection, chronic granulomatous disease, granulomatous rosacea, and Wegener granulomatosis. Differentiate erythema induratum from nodular panniculitides (eg, Weber-Christian disease) and nodular vasculitides (eg, syphilitic gumma, nodular pernio) Differentiate papulonecrotic tuberculid from other papulonecrotic entities, such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis, lymphomatoid papulosis, papular eczema, and prurigo simplex with neurotic excoriation. Differentiate lichen scrofulosorum from keratosis spinulosa, lichenoid sarcoid, and lichenoid secondary syphilis Differential Diagnoses OF TUBERCULOSIS Actinomycosis Aspergillosis Bronchiectasis Constrictive Pericarditis Fungal Pneumonia Histoplasmosis Lung Abscess Nocardiosis Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Pott Disease (Tuberculous [TB] Spondylitis) Epidemiology OF TUBERCULOSIS United States With the improvement of living conditions and the introduction of effective treatment (streptomycin) in the late 1940s, the number of patients in the United States with reported TB began to steadily decline (126,000 TB patients in 1944; 84,000 in 1953; 22,000 in 1984; 14,000 in 2004), despite explosive growth in the total population (140 million people in 1946, 185 million in 1960, 226 million in 1980). In 2022, 8,300 TB cases were reported in the USA, compared with 7,874 cases in 2021. TB incidence increased slightly in 2022 (2.5 cases per 100,000 persons) after an artificially generated substantial decline in 2020. This drop was associated with the COVID-19 pandemic-induced social distancing, masking, and missed or delayed diagnoses. Now, after the social distancing restrictions are lifted, and people are seeking health care increasingly, reported TB cases and TB incidence in the United States are returning to pre-pandemic levels. According to the 2023 CDC report, an estimated 13 million people are living with latent TB in the USA. International In 2023, tuberculosis (TB) was responsible for approximately 1.25 million fatalities, including 161,000 individuals co-infected with HIV. TB likely reclaimed its status as the predominant global cause of mortality from a single infectious agent; a position it held prior to being overtaken by COVID-19 for three years. It continued to be the foremost cause of death among HIV-positive individuals and played a significant role in deaths linked to antimicrobial resistance. The same year saw an estimated 10.8 million new TB cases worldwide, comprising 6.0 million men, 3.6 million women, and 1.3 million children. TB is ubiquitous, affecting all countries and age demographics, yet it remains both preventable and curable. Demographics In terms of demographics, the majority of reported TB cases occurred among non-US–born persons (71.4%), with the incidence rate being 15.8 times higher among non-US–born persons (12.5 cases per 100,000 persons) than US-born persons (0.8 cases per 100,000 persons). Among non-US–born persons with TB disease in 2021, the most common countries of birth included Mexico, the Philippines, India, Vietnam, and China. Among non-US–born persons, the countries of birth with the highest US incidence rates (cases per 100,000 persons from the country population living in the United States) of TB disease were the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Congo, Mongolia, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Somalia. In 2021, among the persons with TB disease in the United States, 36% identified as non-Hispanic Asian persons. The remainder included Hispanic or Latino persons (30.6%), non-Hispanic, African Americans (18.0%), and non-Hispanic White persons (11.2%). TB incidence rates are higher among adults than among children. Among individuals 15 years and older, the incidence rates increase with age, with adults 65 years or older having the highest TB incidence rate in 2021 (4.0 cases per 100,000 persons). In 2021, males accounted for 61.3% of TB cases in the United States, including 62.6% of cases among US-born persons and 60.7% among non-US–born persons Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) Treatment Guidelines The National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued updated treatment guidelines for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among persons who live in the United States. The recommended 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines include three preferred rifamycin-based regimens and two alternative daily-isoniazid monotherapy regimens. These recommendations are intended for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections with presumed susceptibility to isoniazid or rifampin. M tuberculosis strains resistant to isoniazid and rifampin are exempt from these recommendations. Generally, rifamycin-based treatment regimens administered in short courses are preferred over isoniazid monotherapy administered in longer courses for treating LTBI. Preferred treatment regimens for LTBI The rifamycin-based preferred regimens for LTBI are as follows: Once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine for 3 months (strongly recommended in adults and children >2 years, including those with HIV infection) OR Daily rifampin for 4 months (strongly recommended in HIV-negative adults and children of all ages) OR Daily isoniazid plus rifampin for 3 months (conditionally recommended in adults and children of all ages and HIV-positive persons) Prescribing providers or pharmacists should note that rifampin and rifapentine are not interchangeable, and care should be taken to administer the correct medication for the intended regimen. Alternative treatment regimens for LTBI The alternative treatment regimens are as follows: Daily isoniazid for 6 months (strongly recommended in HIV-negative adults and children of all ages and conditionally in HIV-positive adults and children of all ages) OR Daily isoniazid for 9 months (conditionally recommended in adults and children of all ages regardless of HIV infection status) The following is a list of commonly occurring adverse events and their associated anti-TB drugs: Hepatitis (malaise, fatigue, fever, anorexia, nausea, dark urine) INH Bedaquiline Rifampin Pyrazinamide Peripheral neuropathy INH Linezolid Ocular toxicity Ethambutol Rash Pyrazinamide Ethambutol Fluoroquinolones Amikacin Beta-lactams INH Streptomycin Para-aminosalicylic acid Cranial nerve VIII dysfunction and renal dysfunction Amikacin Streptomycin Capreomycin Kanamycin Gastrointestinal upset All anti-TB drugs Myalgias-arthralgias Bedaquiline Pyrazinamide Anxiety, confusion, psychosis Cycloserine Fluoroquinolones Hypoglycemia Fluoroquinolones Tendonitis Fluoroquinolones People with TB and HIV coinfection undergoing antiretroviral therapy present additional challenges. Coadministration of anti-TB and antiretroviral agents can pose significant risks due to adverse reactions and drug-drug interactions. For example, rifamycins cause decreased plasma concentrations of protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. In coinfected individuals, the restoration of immunity may result in clinical deterioration due to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Excellent references provide discussions of the management of these pharmacological challenges PREDEFINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON TUBERCULOSIS Q. How common is tuberculosis? A. In 2020, about 10 million people became ill with TB throughout the world, and about 1.5 million people died from it. TB was once the leading cause of death in the U.S., but with new treatments, the number of cases fell rapidly in the 1940s and 1950s. There were 7,860 tuberculosis cases reported in the U.S. in 2021. Q1. What\\'s the most likely cause of my symptoms? A. Your symptoms of chronic cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss could be caused by tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, other conditions can cause similar symptoms, so further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Q2. Do I need tests? A. Yes. To diagnose TB, your healthcare provider will perform: A medical history and physical exam A TB skin test (Mantoux test) or a TB blood test (Interferon Gamma Release Assay, IGRA) to check for immune response to TB bacteria A chest X-ray to look for lung changes Sputum tests including smear microscopy, molecular tests (PCR), and culture to detect TB bacteria and test for drug resistance These tests help determine if you have latent TB infection or active TB disease. Q3. What treatments are available? Which do you recommend? A. TB is treated with a combination of antibiotics over several months. The most common regimen for drug-sensitive TB includes: Isoniazid Rifampin Ethambutol Pyrazinamide Treatment usually lasts 6 months, with the first 2 months including all four drugs (intensive phase), followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin (continuation phase). Your doctor will tailor treatment based on drug susceptibility testing and your overall health. Q4. What if the treatment doesn\\'t work? A. If symptoms persist or worsen, or if drug resistance is detected, your healthcare provider may: Perform further testing for drug-resistant TB Adjust your treatment regimen with second-line drugs, which may be longer and more complex Monitor closely for side effects and adherence to therapy Early detection of treatment failure is important to prevent complications and transmission. Q5. How long do I have to stay on the treatment? A. Standard treatment for drug-sensitive TB is 6 months. For drug-resistant TB, treatment may last 9 months to 2 years depending on the resistance pattern. It is crucial to complete the full course to ensure cure and prevent relapse or resistance. Q6. How often do I need to follow up with you? A. You will have regular follow-ups, especially during the intensive phase (first 2 months), to: Monitor your response to treatment Check for side effects Review sputum test results Follow-up frequency may be weekly or biweekly initially, then monthly during continuation phase. Your doctor will advise based on your progress. Q7. I have other health problems. How can I best manage these conditions together? A. Managing TB alongside other health conditions (like diabetes, HIV, or liver disease) requires: Coordinated care between your TB specialist and other healthcare providers Close monitoring for drug interactions and side effects Adjusting TB treatment if needed based on your other conditions Maintaining good control of your other illnesses to support your immune system Be sure to inform all your doctors about your TB diagnosis and medications Genomic Data of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) Genome Size and Structure: The M. tuberculosis genome is a circular chromosome of approximately 4.4 million base pairs (Mb), containing around 4,000 genes (e.g., 4,411,529 bp in the H37Rv reference strain). The genome has a high GC content (~64-65%). Gene Content and Families: About 40% of genes have experimentally confirmed functions, with another 44% having putative functions assigned. The genome encodes many genes involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism (around 250 genes), essential for the bacterium’s waxy, lipid-rich cell envelope and survival in host macrophages. A notable feature is the PE/PPE gene families, which constitute about 10% of the coding capacity. These genes encode glycine-rich proteins involved in antigenic variation and immune evasion. The genome also contains genes related to virulence factors, immune modulation, dormancy, and intracellular survival. Lineages and Genetic Diversity: M. tuberculosis is classified into multiple lineages (L1–L10), with Lineage 2.2 (Beijing family) and Lineage 4 being prevalent in many regions. Genetic variation among strains is relatively low (monomorphic), but important mutations and gene copy number variations contribute to differences in virulence, drug resistance, and host adaptation. Drug resistance mutations are often found in genes encoding targets of first-line drugs (e.g., isoniazid, rifampicin). Virulence and Adaptation: The genome encodes multiple secretion systems, including the ESX-5 type VII secretion system, which exports many PE/PPE proteins important for virulence. Regions of difference (RDs) in the genome distinguish M. tuberculosis from related species like M. bovis and contribute to host specificity and pathogenicity. Genes involved in host cell entry (e.g., mce family), stress response, and immune modulation are critical for persistence and disease progression Doctor-patient conversation about Tuberculosis (TB) Doctor: Good morning, Mrs. Rani. I understand you’ve been coughing for several weeks and recently noticed some blood in your sputum. Let’s talk about what might be causing your symptoms. Patient: Yes, doctor. I’ve been feeling weak and coughing a lot. What could this be? Doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination, it’s possible you have tuberculosis, or TB. It’s a bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs and causes a persistent cough, sometimes with blood, along with weight loss, night sweats, and fever. Patient: How do people get TB? Is it contagious? Doctor: TB spreads through the air when someone with active TB coughs or sneezes. It’s important to avoid close contact with others until we confirm your diagnosis and start treatment. Patient: What tests will I need? Doctor: We’ll do a chest X-ray and collect sputum samples to look for the bacteria. We may also do a skin or blood test to see if your body has been exposed to TB. Patient: Is TB curable? Doctor: Yes, TB can be cured with the right antibiotics taken regularly for at least six months. It’s very important to complete the full course to fully clear the infection and prevent resistance. Patient: What if the treatment doesn’t work? Doctor: If your symptoms don’t improve or if the bacteria are resistant to standard drugs, we’ll adjust your treatment and may use different medications. We’ll monitor you closely throughout. Patient: How often will I need to come back? Doctor: Initially, we’ll see you every few weeks to check your progress and side effects. Once stable, follow-ups will be less frequent but regular until treatment is complete. Patient: I also have diabetes. Will that affect my TB treatment? Doctor: It can make TB harder to treat, so we’ll coordinate your care carefully to manage both conditions. Controlling your blood sugar is very important during TB treatment. Patient’s Husband: What can we do to prevent TB in our family? Doctor: Good ventilation, covering coughs, and avoiding sharing utensils help reduce spread. Also, make sure everyone completes their vaccinations and gets tested if they have symptoms. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I feel better knowing what to expect. Doctor: You’re welcome. Remember, adherence to treatment and regular follow-up are key to your recovery. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns.

They are a significant reason for morbidity and mortality in children (below five years of age) and people (above 65) globally. Lower respiratory tract infections cause difficulty breathing and may threaten the patient\\'s life if left untreated. Keep reading to learn more about the causes of Lower respiratory tract infections, their definition, symptoms, types, diagnosis, prevention, medicine, treatment, and other important detail in this article. Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Lower Respiratory Tract Infection refers to infection of the body\\'s airways. These infections develop below the larynx (voice box), including the trachea and the alveolar sacs in the lungs. Different viruses and bacteria usually cause lower respiratory tract infections. LRTI is a contagious infection which means it can easily spread from one person to another through close contact. Lower respiratory tract infection generally lasts from 7 to 21 days. However, if lower respiratory infections last for more than 21 days, it could be a sign of a severe lower respiratory tract infection. Hence, it\\'s always best to seek medical care as soon as the patient feels the symptoms. Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Types There are various types of lower respiratory tract infections. It depends on the kind of virus or bacteria that causes them. Many of them are treatable. However, if they remain untreated for a long time, they can cause severe health complications. The important types of lower respiratory infections are as follows: Pneumonia: It is a lower respiratory tract infection in which the air sacs in the lungs fill with pus or fluids. This condition could inflame one or both lungs. People with weakened immune systems and infants are more prone to pneumonia than others. Bronchitis: It is the swelling in the lining of the bronchial tubes, chiefly the large airways. Bronchial tubes bring in and take out the air from the lungs. Bronchitis is most common in older adults and infants under five years. Bronchiolitis: It refers to lung inflammation, especially of the small airways. Bronchiolitis is most common in infants and toddlers under two years of age. Tuberculosis: It is an infectious disease that affects the lungs. Tuberculosis can happen to people of any age group. Other LRTIs include acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/chronic bronchitis (AECB) and acute bronchiectasis. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections Causes The major causes of lower respiratory tract infections are viruses and bacteria. However, the type of bacteria/ virus depends on the specific lower respiratory tract disease. The following are the major causes of lower respiratory infections: Bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumonia and Streptococcus pneumonia (pneumococcus), Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and so on. Viruses, such as influenza and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Fungal infection Apart from these, environmental and artificial factors also cause lower respiratory tract infections. These are as follows: Air pollution Tobacco smoke Vapours and fumes Allergens Dust Chemicals Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Risk Factors There are several risk factors that make a person more likely to develop lower respiratory infections. Some of the lower respiratory tract infection risk factors include: Weakened immune system Being more than 65 years old Being under five years old Recent surgery A recent cold or flu Smoking Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Symptoms The most common lower respiratory infection symptoms are: Breathlessness Dry cough Stuffy nose Sore throat Low fever Dull headache The major lower respiratory tract infection symptoms are as follows: Sneezing Stuffy nose Runny nose Sore throat Difficulty breathing Headache High fever (above 100 F) Wheezing Cough Muscle pain Lower Respiratory Tract Infections diagnosis A primary care physician generally diagnoses lower respiratory tract infections based on the symptoms and physical examination. For physical examination, the doctor will listen to the patient\\'s breathing sound and pattern and check the patient’s history to track any past respiratory disease. However, the doctor might also conduct numerous medical examinations to determine the exact causative agent of the patient\\'s lower respiratory tract infection. Some of them are as follows: Blood tests: To check for the vital measures and presence of bacteria or viruses in the blood. Sputum test: To help detect the type of bacteria or virus causing lower respiratory tract infection. Pulse oximetry: To check the oxygen level in the patient\\'s bloodstream as lower respiratory tract infection causes difficulty breathing. Swab test: To confirm the possibility of a lower respiratory tract infection. CT scans and chest X-rays: To diagnose diseases like pneumonia and bronchitis. Heart tests like Echocardiogram and Electrocardiogram can also be performed to rule out any chances of cardiac diseases. Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Treatment Home Remedies for Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Steam inhalation: The patient should take inhaling steams as this helps to clear the respiratory tract of any mucus. It relieves nasal congestion as well. Saline water gargle: Gargling with saltwater helps relieve pain in the throat. It aids in thinning the mucus lining along the respiratory tract, too. Ginger: Ginger is antiviral and antimicrobial. Thus, patients can eat ginger every day to help treat the infection. Saline nasal drops: These drops help clear the nasal passageways of any mucus. Medications for Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Allopathic Medicines Lower respiratory tract infections are often caused by viruses. Hence, antibiotics do not work against them. However, over-the-counter medicines for cough or fever can help with lower respiratory tract infections. Apart from that, patients can also take medication such as a bronchodilator inhaler. Consult the doctor before taking any medicines for lower respiratory tract infections. Ayurvedic Medicines: Tulsi: Holy basil or tulsi is an effective remedy to remove cough from the body. It also strengthens the immune system. Neem: It consists of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial characteristics. Thereby helping in lower respiratory tract infections. Giloy: It helps to remove toxins from the lungs. Giloy is beneficial in tuberculosis and asthma too. Homeopathic Medicines: Homoeopathic medicines are a great treatment for LRTI too. A few helpful homoeopathic medicines are as follows: Belladonna Adrenaline Eriodictyon californicum Phosphorus Aconitum napellus Always consult a homoeopathic doctor before taking any of the above medicines. Other treatment methods for Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Intravenous fluid is essential for the body but in a limited amount. To treat low levels of IV fluid in the body: Patients can receive oral medications To treat high levels of IV fluid in the body: Patients can receive diuretics To treat oxygen levels in the body, the following treatments are given to the patients: Mechanical ventilation Supplemental oxygen Note: Please consult a doctor before giving the patient any of the above-mentioned treatments. Risks and Complications of Lower Respiratory Tract Infections If lower respiratory tract infections are not treated on time, they might lead to: Pus buildup (in lungs) Inflammation in the lungs Lung abscess Bronchiectasis Deafness Can also lead to life-threatening conditions such as: Respiratory failure Respiratory arrest Heart failure Sepsis When to see a doctor Consult a doctor if the patient feels the following symptoms: Excessive cough Unable to take liquid for 4-5 hours Wheezing High fever Patient Appears pale Feels difficulty breathing Grunts or wheezes Diet for Lower Respiratory Tract Infections Staying hydrated and eating a diet rich in minerals and vitamins will help reduce the risk of developing any disease condition. Below are some dietary measures for people with lower respiratory tract infections. Take diets rich in green leafy vegetables, cauliflower, cabbage, peas, broccoli, and spinach. Eat fruits rich in Vitamin C such, as Kiwi, orange, and sweet lime. Avoid refined and processed foods Avoid dairy and high-fat products Avoid sugar and high-sugar products Avoid cold drinks, alcohol and caffeine Lifestyle changes for Lower Respiratory Tract Infections Start exercising daily. Do yoga and pranayama as it helps improve the breathing process and relieve mucus and nasal congestion. Get 8 hours of good sleep. Wear a face mask when going or doing outdoor activities. Wash or sanitize the hands frequently. Prevention of Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Lower respiratory tract infections are highly contagious, especially in small children and older adults. Nevertheless, there are a variety of factors that, if taken into action, can prevent lower respiratory tract infections from occurring. To prevent lower respiratory tract infection, one should follow the crucial guidelines listed below: Wash hands frequently, especially before eating food. Maintain distance from an infected person. Cover the mouth while sneezing or coughing. Get vaccine shots, such as MMR vaccines and pneumococcal vaccines. Stay away from allergens, smoke, chemicals, and other harmful substances that can put one at risk of developing LRTI. Do not visit an LRTI endemic area. Avoid touching any objects, as they might be contaminated with bacteria or viruses. Avoid chewing tobacco. Avoid smoking or drinking alcohol.

This represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Incidence and Mortality Rates: The global age-standardized incidence rate was around 6,295 cases per 100,000 population, and the death rate was approximately 34.3 deaths per 100,000 population in 2019. Since 1990, incidence has decreased by about 24%, and mortality has declined by nearly 49% worldwide. High-Burden Countries: Countries with the highest incidence rates include Guinea, Chad, and India. Regions with the greatest mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) include South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Latin America. Age Distribution: The highest burden is seen in children under 5 years of age and adults over 70 years. In 2021, about 502,000 deaths occurred in children under 5, mostly in low socio-demographic index (SDI) countries. Risk Factors: Major contributors to LRTI burden include: Child wasting (malnutrition): 33.1% Household air pollution from solid fuels: 24.9% Lack of access to handwashing facilities: 14.4% Additionally, non-optimal temperatures (cold exposure) contribute significantly to LRTI mortality and morbidity. Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic: Non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced transmission of many respiratory pathogens, temporarily decreasing LRTI incidence and mortality in 2020–21. Sex Differences: Males generally have a higher burden of LRTI deaths compared to females, particularly in older age groups Predefined Questions and Answers for Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI) Q1. What is a lower respiratory tract infection? A. A lower respiratory tract infection is an infection in the lungs or airways below the voice box, including conditions like bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. Q2. What are the common symptoms of LRTI? A. Common symptoms include cough (which may be severe), fever, chest discomfort, difficulty breathing, wheezing, and sometimes chest pain. In severe cases, there may be rapid breathing, blue discoloration of the skin, and difficulty maintaining oxygen levels. Q3. What causes lower respiratory tract infections? A. Most LRTIs are caused by viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, adenovirus, and coronaviruses. Bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae can also cause LRTIs, especially pneumonia. Q4. How is LRTI diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical symptoms and physical examination, supported by chest X-rays and laboratory tests including sputum cultures and viral PCR tests when needed. Q5. How are lower respiratory tract infections treated? A. Treatment depends on the cause: Viral infections often require supportive care (rest, fluids, oxygen if needed). Bacterial infections are treated with appropriate antibiotics. Severe cases may require hospitalization and respiratory support. Q6. When should I see a doctor for LRTI? A. Seek medical care if you have difficulty breathing, persistent high fever, chest pain, coughing up blood, or if symptoms worsen or do not improve after a few days. Q7. Can LRTIs be prevented? A. Prevention includes good hand hygiene, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus, and reducing exposure to air pollution and smoking. Q8. What is the difference between upper and lower respiratory tract infections? A. Upper respiratory tract infections affect areas above the larynx (nose, throat), causing symptoms like runny nose and sore throat. Lower respiratory tract infections affect the airways and lungs below the larynx, often causing cough, fever, and breathing difficulties Doctor-patient conversation about a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) Doctor: Hello, what brings you in today? Patient: I’ve had a cough for about a week now, and I’m feeling quite tired. I had a cold a few days before the cough started. Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms like fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain? Patient: I had a mild fever a couple of days ago, and sometimes it’s hard to catch my breath, especially when I’m active. Doctor: Thanks for sharing. Based on your symptoms and the exam, it looks like you have a viral lower respiratory tract infection, similar to acute bronchitis. This is common, especially during this season. Patient: Do I need antibiotics? I’m worried it might get worse. Doctor: In most cases like yours, antibiotics aren’t needed because viruses cause the infection. Antibiotics won’t help and can cause side effects. The best treatment is rest, plenty of fluids, and medications to relieve symptoms like fever or cough if needed. Patient: What if I don’t get better or if it gets worse? Doctor: If your symptoms worsen—like high fever, difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood—or if you don’t improve after 10 days, please come back. We can then do further tests, like chest X-rays or sputum tests, to check for bacterial infections or other causes. Patient: How long will this last? Doctor: Most people start feeling better within 1 to 2 weeks, but sometimes the cough can linger for a few more weeks. Patient: Is there anything I can do to prevent this in the future? Doctor: Good question. Regular handwashing, avoiding close contact with sick people, and staying up to date with vaccinations like the flu shot help reduce your risk. Patient: Okay, thank you. I’ll follow your advice. Doctor: You’re welcome. Feel free to call or come in if you have any concerns or if your symptoms change.

The condition is caused by changes in the genes that make proteins needed to form healthy muscles. There are many types of muscular dystrophy. Symptoms of the most common type start in childhood, mostly in boys. Other types sometimes don\\'t start until adulthood. Medicines and other treatments can help manage the symptoms and slow the course of muscular dystrophy. Types of muscular dystrophy There are more than 30 types of muscular dystrophy. Some of the more common forms include: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD): This is the most common form of muscular dystrophy. It mainly affects boys, but girls can also have a milder version of it. As DMD progresses, it affects your heart and lungs. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD): BMD is the second most common type of muscular dystrophy. It mainly affects boys, but girls can have milder symptoms. Symptoms of BMD can appear any time between the ages of 5 and 60, but they typically start by your teenage years. The severity of BMD varies from person to person. Myotonic dystrophy: This is the most common type of muscular dystrophy that’s diagnosed in adulthood. It affects men and women equally. People with myotonic dystrophy have difficulty relaxing their muscles after using them. The condition can also affect your heart and lungs and may cause endocrine issues, such as thyroid disease and diabetes. Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD): CMD refers to a group of muscular dystrophies that become apparent at or near birth (“congenital” means “present from birth”). CMD causes overall muscle weakness with possible joint stiffness or looseness. Depending on the type, CMD may also involve spinal curvature (scoliosis), breathing issues, intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, eye issues or seizures. Distal muscular dystrophy: This type affects the muscles of your hands, feet, lower arms and lower legs. It tends to affect people in their 40s and 60s. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD): EDMD mainly affects male children and young adults. It tends to cause muscle weakness in your shoulders, upper arms and shins. EDMD also affects your heart. The condition usually progresses slowly. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD): FSHD most commonly affects muscles in your face, shoulders and upper arms. Symptoms tend to appear before age 20. About 4 out of 100,000 people in the U.S. have this form. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD): LGMD affects the muscles in your upper arms, upper legs, shoulders and hips. It affects people of all ages. Approximately 2 out of 100,000 people in the U.S. have LGMD. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD): OPMD weakens muscles in your eyelids and throat. Symptoms, such as droopy eyelids (ptosis) and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), often appear in your 40s or 50s. About 1 in 100,000 people have OPMD. Muscular dystrophy is relatively rare. All of the different types combined affect about 16 to 25 per 100,000 people in the U.S. The most common childhood form is Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The most common adulthood form is myotonic dystrophy. causes muscular dystrophy Mutations (changes) in the genes that are responsible for healthy muscle structure and function cause muscular dystrophy. The mutations mean that the cells that would normally maintain your muscles can no longer fulfill this role, leading to progressive muscle weakness. There are several genes — and possible genetic mutations — that play a role in muscle function. This is why there are so many different forms of muscular dystrophy. In the majority of muscular dystrophy cases, you inherit the genetic mutation from one or both of your biological parents. There are three ways you can inherit muscular dystrophy, depending on the specific type: Recessive inheritance: This means you’ve inherited a genetic mutation that causes the condition from both of your biological parents. Some forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy have this inheritance. Dominant inheritance: This means you only need to inherit the mutated gene from one of your biological parents to develop the condition. Myotonic, facioscapulohumeral and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophies have this type of inheritance. Sex-linked (X-linked) inheritance: A genetically male person has one X and one Y chromosome, and a genetically female person has two X chromosomes. A genetic mutation on the X chromosome causes a sex-linked condition. As genetically male people only have one copy of each gene on the X chromosome, they’ll develop the condition if one of those genes is mutated. A genetically female person can have X-linked disorders, but the symptoms are usually less severe. Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies have this type of inheritance. In rare cases, a person may develop muscular dystrophy spontaneously, meaning the mutation happened randomly and wasn’t inherited. This is called a de novo mutation. Risk factors OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY Muscular dystrophy occurs in people of all ages and ethnic groups. But the most common type, Duchenne, usually affects young boys. People with a family history of muscular dystrophy have a higher risk of getting the disease or passing it on to their children. Symptoms OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY The main symptom of muscular dystrophy is muscle weakness that becomes worse over time. This makes everyday tasks harder to do. The type of muscular dystrophy that a person has determines the: Exact symptoms. Age range at which the symptoms start. Muscle groups that are affected. There are over 30 types of muscular dystrophy. Here are some of the main types along with key symptoms. Duchenne type muscular dystrophy This is the most common form. Girls can carry the gene change that causes the disease, and some have symptoms. But this type of muscular dystrophy is much more common in boys. Most often, the symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy start in early childhood. The symptoms can include challenges with movement, such as: Late walking. Frequent falls. Trouble rising from the floor or a lying or seated position. Trouble running, jumping or climbing stairs. Waddling gait. Walking on the toes or the balls of the feet. Other symptoms can include: Large calf muscles. Muscle pain and stiffness. Learning or behavior-related challenges. Delayed growth. Becker muscular dystrophy The symptoms of this type are like those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but Becker muscular dystrophy tends to be milder, and it becomes worse more slowly. In general, symptoms start in the teens or early adulthood. They might not occur until the mid-20s or later. Other types of muscular dystrophy Some types of muscular dystrophy are defined by a certain feature. Or they\\'re defined by where in the body the symptoms start. Examples include: Emery-Dreifuss. The symptoms of this type often start by age 10. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy causes certain joints to become stiff. Early on, some children may walk on their toes due to stiff tendons in the heels. They also may have trouble bending the elbows. This type of muscular dystrophy also causes muscles in the shoulders, upper arms and calves to slowly waste and weaken. Some people with the disease develop heart conditions that can cause fainting. Heart conditions need to be watched closely by a healthcare team. Myotonic. With this type of muscular dystrophy, the muscles can\\'t relax at will. For example, it might be hard to let go of someone\\'s hand after shaking it. Facial and neck muscles often are the first to be affected. Symptoms often start between the ages of 20 and 30, but some have symptoms shortly after birth to childhood. As the disease becomes worse, the heart might beat out of rhythm and the heart muscle can grow weaker. Heart rhythm issues can be the first complication for some people. Muscles involved in breathing also can become weaker. This can lead to poor breathing, especially during sleep. Other names for myotonic dystrophy are Steinert\\'s disease or dystrophia myotonica. Facioscapulohumeral (FSHD). With this type, muscle weakness usually starts in the face, shoulders and upper arms. The weakness often affects one side of the body more than the other. When muscles around the eyes are affected, that can cause trouble fully closing the eyelids and lead to dryness of the eye. When the shoulders are affected, the shoulder blades might stick out like wings when the arms are raised. Sometimes, mild hearing loss also may occur. The symptoms of FSHD tend to start in the teenage years. Congenital. There are many types of congenital MD. These types cause symptoms at birth or before age 2. Most children with congenital muscular dystrophy have muscle weakness that becomes worse. But some forms of congenital muscular dystrophy progress slowly and cause mild disability. Others become worse quickly and cause serious health challenges. Babies with muscle weakness or lack of muscle tone can seem \"floppy.\" Later on, babies and toddlers might take longer than usual to roll over, sit up or walk. Or they might not meet certain milestones of development at all. Limb-girdle. This type often affects muscles around the shoulders and hips. Some people with limb-girdle dystrophy develop minor disabilities over time. Others develop serious trouble using their arms or legs to do everyday activities, such as walking or carrying things. The age at which symptoms start, how serious they become and how quickly they get worse varies. Oculopharyngeal. This type tends to weaken the eyelids and the throat muscles. It\\'s also been linked with muscle weakness in the limbs and near the center of the body from top to bottom. It can cause trouble swallowing, weakness of the tongue and drooping eyelids. In time, some people also have trouble with movement. Symptoms often start in the 40s and 50s, and they become worse slowly. When to see a doctor Get medical advice if you notice symptoms of muscle weakness in yourself or your child. Symptoms could include delays in development, more clumsiness than usual and falling. Diagnosis OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY Your healthcare team asks about your or your child\\'s medical history, including general health and past illnesses. A physical exam is done. After that, the healthcare team might recommend tests. These tests are based on the type of muscular dystrophy suspected. They may include the following: Enzyme tests. Damaged muscles release proteins called enzymes into the blood. These enzymes include creatine kinase. In a person who hasn\\'t had a serious injury, high blood levels of creatine kinase suggest a muscle disease. Genetic testing. Blood samples can be checked for changes in some of the genes that cause types of muscular dystrophy. Muscle biopsy. A small piece of muscle can be removed through an incision or with a hollow needle. Then a lab checks this tissue sample. The lab can tell muscular dystrophies apart from other muscle diseases. Tests to monitor the heart, such as electrocardiography and echocardiogram. These tests are used to check how well the heart works, especially in people who have myotonic muscular dystrophy. Tests to monitor the lungs. These tests are used to check lung function. Electromyography. A special needle is placed into the muscle to be tested. Electrical activity is measured as the muscle is relaxed and as it is gently tightened. Changes in the pattern of electrical activity can confirm a muscle disease. This test rarely is used to find out if Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy is the cause of someone\\'s symptoms. Treatment OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY No cure exists for any type of muscular dystrophy. But treatment for some types of the disease can help people: Maintain muscle strength. Prevent complications. Stay independent and mobile longer. Improve heart and lung health. Treatments for some types of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, in particular, are quickly expanding based on research. People with muscular dystrophy often need to be monitored throughout life by a team of healthcare professionals. A primary care doctor often helps oversee your overall medical care. Most often, the care team includes: A doctor called a neurologist, who treats brain and nervous system conditions. It\\'s key to find a neurologist who has experience treating diseases that affect how muscles work due to nerves and muscles in the body. These are called neuromuscular diseases. A doctor called a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician or physiatrist, who helps people with disabilities function better, be more independent and have less pain. A physical therapist, who teaches exercises to improve movement and keep muscles stronger and flexible for longer. An occupational therapist, who teaches various ways to make everyday tasks easier. Many people with muscular dystrophy also might need other doctors, including a: Lung doctor called a pulmonologist, as well as a respiratory therapist who helps with breathing. Heart doctor called a cardiologist. Doctor whose speciality is treating sleep conditions. Hormone expert called an endocrinologist to help with bone density and growth concerns. Orthopedic surgeon, who treats problems with bones, joints, ligaments, tendons and muscles. Doctor called a gastroenterologist, who treats problems with the stomach and intestinal tract. A palliative care doctor, who cares for people living with serious illnesses. A genetics doctor or counselor to help guide you about the course your muscular dystrophy likely will take. Many people with muscular dystrophy also might need to see other specialists, such as a: Speech therapist for swallowing and communication. Dietitian or nutritionist, who recommends special diets when needed. Social worker for support and community resources. Psychologist or psychiatrist to assess and treats mood or behavior-related conditions. Muscular dystrophy treatment includes medicines, physical and occupational therapy, equipment, surgery, and other procedures. Ongoing tests of walking, swallowing, breathing and hand function help the treatment team change treatments as needed over time. Medicines FOR MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY Your healthcare team might recommend medicines such as: Corticosteroids. These medicines can help with muscle strength and slow some types of muscular dystrophy from becoming worse. Examples of corticosteroids include prednisone and deflazacort (Emflaza). Long-term use of this type of medicine can cause weight gain and weaker bones. That raises the risk of breaking a bone, also called a fracture. Targeted medicines and gene therapies. These are tailored to treat some people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who have certain confirmed gene changes. More and more treatments are becoming available based on research. These include eteplirsen (Exondys 51), golodirsen (Vyondys 53), viltolarsen (Viltepso), casimersen (Amondys 45), and delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl (Elevidys). Ask your healthcare professional what your treatment choices are. Approved targeted treatments may vary by country. Heart medicines. If muscular dystrophy damages the heart muscle and causes heart symptoms, these medicines may be prescribed. They include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers. Therapy Various therapy and assistive devices can improve the quality of life in people with muscular dystrophy. They may help some people live longer too. Examples include: Range-of-motion and stretching exercises. Muscular dystrophy can limit how flexible and mobile affected joints are. Range-of-motion exercises can help to keep joints as flexible as possible. Exercise. Low-impact aerobic exercise can help with strength, movement and general health. Examples include walking and swimming. Some types of strengthening exercises also might be helpful. But talk to your healthcare professional before you start exercising. Some types of workouts might be harmful or unsafe to do. Braces. These devices can help keep muscles and tendons stretched and flexible. This slows contractures from becoming worse. Braces also can aid movement and function by supporting weaker muscles. Mobility aids. Canes, walkers and wheelchairs can help people with muscular dystrophy move around and stay independent. Breathing assistance. As muscles involved in breathing become weaker, deep breathing and coughing exercises taught by a healthcare professional can help. Some people also need help breathing during sleep. A device that delivers air through a face mask may be prescribed. Other people who have serious breathing problems need to use a machine that forces air in and out of the lungs, called a ventilator. Surgery Surgery might be needed to fix contractures or a curve in the spine that could make breathing harder over time. Heart health may be improved with a pacemaker or other heart device. Preventing respiratory infections Illnesses that affect the muscles involved in breathing can become a problem with muscular dystrophy. So, it\\'s key to be vaccinated for pneumonia. Also, keep up to date with shots that protect against the flu and COVID-19. Try to stay away from people who are sick. Complications OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY Muscular dystrophy can lead to serious health issues, such as the following: Trouble walking. In time, some people with muscular dystrophy will use a wheelchair for mobility. Trouble using arms. Daily activities can become harder if the muscles of the arms and shoulders are affected. Shortening of muscles or tendons around joints, called contractures. Along with the weakness caused by the muscular dystrophy, less range of motion in joints also can limit walking and arm use. Trouble breathing or coughing. Over time, muscular dystrophy can affect the muscles involved in breathing. Some people who develop serious trouble breathing might need to use devices that help keep the airways open or assist with breathing. Muscular dystrophy also can affect muscles that are used to cough. That can make it hard for the body to remove mucus from the lungs and windpipe. If your child has trouble coughing, ask your healthcare professional to recommend techniques or treatments that can help. Curved spine, also called scoliosis. This is most likely to happen in a growing child who can\\'t walk. The curving may play a role in breathing troubles and challenges with getting into certain positions. Sometimes, surgery is needed to correct the curving. Heart problems. Muscular dystrophy can make it harder for the heart to pump well or beat with a regular rhythm. Swallowing problems. If the muscles involved with swallowing are affected, that can lead to trouble getting enough nutrition. Trouble swallowing also raises the risk of a lung infection caused by breathing food or liquid into the airways. This is called aspiration pneumonia. To lower these risks, nutrition may need to be given through a flexible device called a feeding tube. Brain-related differences. Some children with certain types of muscular dystrophy have challenges with learning, intelligence or social skills. For example, those with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may have higher rates of autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety compared with people who don\\'t have muscular dystrophy. If your child has a learning, intellectual or mental health condition, talk with your child\\'s school. Ask for changes that can help your child learn more easily, called accommodations. Weakening bones. Children may have fewer minerals in their bones than usual. This is called low bone density. It can lead to weaker bones over time, especially in children who use wheelchairs. Low bone density raises the risk of broken bones, also called fractures. A healthcare professional might prescribe medicines to help strengthen weak bones. Outlook / Prognosis OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY The prognosis (outlook) for muscular dystrophy varies depending on the type. Your healthcare provider will be able to give you a better idea of what to expect based on the type of muscular dystrophy you have and your unique situation. The life expectancy for muscular dystrophy varies significantly depending on the type. For example, people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) often die from the condition by the age of 25. But other forms of muscular dystrophy, such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, don’t typically affect life expectancy. Living With MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY If you have muscular dystrophy or you’re taking care of someone with it, it’s important to advocate for yourself/them to ensure you/they get the best medical care and as much access to therapy as possible. Advocating for care can help you/them have the best possible quality of life. You and your family may also want to consider joining a support group to meet others who can relate to your experiences. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY Muscular dystrophy is not always a straightforward diagnosis and can be mistaken for several other diseases with overlapping etiologies. Clinicians must carefully consider and exclude the following conditions in patients presenting with a muscular disorder, as these alternative diagnoses can lead to significant morbidity and mortality: Adrenal insufficiency Electrolyte imbalance: sodium, potassium, and magnesium Hypercalcemia Porphyrias Rabies Complicated migraine Postictal (Todd) paralysis Hypoglycemia Acute spastic paraparesis (a medical emergency) Myasthenia gravis Pancoast tumor Paraneoplastic syndromes An acute onset gait disorder is often indicative of acute systemic decompensation. A thorough and systematic evaluation is essential to exclude catastrophic presentations. It is not recommended to attribute a gait disorder to a single disease. Gait abnormalities can indicate a severe medical emergency, especially when the problem is associated with any of these additional symptoms: Headache (raised intracranial pressure) Nausea or vomiting Decreased alertness Impaired coordination presenting on only one side of the body Recent viral illness/immunization (Guillain-Barré syndrome) Trauma. Epidemiology OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY United States statistics The incidence of MD varies, depending on the specific type of MD under consideration. Duchenne MD is the most common MD and is sex-linked, with an inheritance pattern of 1 case per 3500 live male births. One third of cases occur as a result of spontaneous new mutations. Becker MD is the second most common form, with an incidence of 1 case per 30,000 live male births. Other types of MD are rare. For example, limb-girdle dystrophy occurs in only 1.3% of patients with MDs. International statistics The incidence internationally is similar to that of the US for most of the dystrophies, except for the oculopharyngeal type, which is more common in French Canadians than in other groups. Distal MD tends to occur in Sweden. GUIDELINES OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY Screening In 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published a clinical report from a multidisciplinary expert panel that developed an algorithm for the screening of children for motor delays with guidance for the initial workup and referral. Identification of motor delays includes ongoing surveillance of the following milestones : Sitting Standing Walking Running Going up stairs The report recommends that developmental screenings take place at well-child visits at 9, 18, 30, and 48 months of age. The following motor skills are typically acquired at earlier ages, and their absence at these ages signifies delay: 9-month visit - Roll to both sides, sit well without support, and demonstrate motor symmetry without established handedness; ability to grasp and transfer objects hand to hand 18-month visit - Sitting, standing, and walking independently; ability to grasp and manipulate small objects; mild motor delays undetected at the 9-month screening visit may now be apparent 30-month visit - Most motor delays will have already been identified and more subtle gross motor, fine motor, speech, and oral motor impairments may emerge; progressive neuromuscular disorders may manifest as a loss of previously attained gross or fine motor skills 48-month visit - Elementary school skills, with emerging fine motor, handwriting, gross motor, communication, and feeding abilities that promote participation with peers in group activities; loss of skills should alert to the possibility of a progressive disorder The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also supports early identification and evaluation of motor delays to enable a quicker referral to a specialist for diagnosis. In collaboration with the National Task Force for Early Identification of Childhood Neuromuscular Disorders, the CDC developed a Web-based diagnostic tool, to assist providers in primary care, rehabilitation medicine, and physical and occupational therapy in the evaluation of children with motor delay and early manifestations of neuromuscular disorders. The website content was endorsed by the AAP. ChildMuscleWeakness.org provides guidance on motor surveillance and screening and includes an aid to the assessment of motor development milestones and recommendations for evaluating the following milestones : Infant+: Head lag on pull to sit Age 6+ months: Achieving and maintaining sitting Age 12+ months: Rising to stand from the floor and gait (walking and running) If a delay is found by using the surveillance aid, a motor delay algorithm provides guidance on testing and referral. The following findings are red flags that indicate the need for an urgent referral to a neurologist: Tongue fasciculations Loss of motor milestones Creatine phosphokinase (CK) level higher than three times normal (however, children with some neuromuscular disorders have normal CK levels) Many neuromuscular conditions increase the risk for malignant hyperthermia with anesthesia use, and anticipated surgery should increase the urgency of a diagnostic evaluation. Questions to consider when evaluating a patient: Are reflexes hypoactive? Hypoactive reflexes may suggest myotonic dystrophy, tabes dorsalis, and progressive muscular atrophy. However, diminished reflexes can also be a result of weakness. Is there any pain present? Muscle weakness and, occasionally, myalgia are typical features of muscle disease. Conversely, a short history of painful weakness in adulthood would suggest an inflammatory myositis. Is the problem acute or chronic? The age and rate of progression can help determine the type of muscle disease. Progressive slow weakness without pain from childhood may indicate degenerative muscular dystrophy. Diseases like Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy cause early fixed contractures, representing distinctive features. Is weakness primarily distal or proximal? The distribution of weakness helps define the likely type of muscle disease. Proximal arm and leg weakness may be present in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Is the weakness localized or diffuse? Muscle weakness could be attributed to various causes, including myopathies (e.g., dermatomyositis), inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), neurologic disorders (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome), or infections (e.g., Lyme disease or trichinosis) Are there any focal neurological lesions? Conditions like myotonic dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, and progressive muscular atrophy may present with partial ptosis. Duchenne muscular dystrophy Genetics: X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene. Onset: Typically, early childhood (around 3 to 5). Clinical features: Progressive muscle weakness, particularly in the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles. Diagnostic tests: Elevated CK levels, genetic testing for DMD gene mutations. Prognosis: Rapid progression, wheelchair dependence by adolescence, cardiopulmonary complications. Becker muscular dystrophy Genetics: X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene. Onset: Later than DMD, often in adolescence or adulthood. Clinical features: Similar to DMD but with milder symptoms and slower progression. Diagnostic tests: Elevated CK levels, genetic testing for DMD gene mutations. Prognosis: Variable, some individuals may remain ambulatory into adulthood. Myotonic dystrophy Genetics: Autosomal dominant disorder, involving DMPK gene (DM1) or CNBP gene (DM2). Clinical features: Myotonia, muscle wasting, cataracts, cardiac conduction abnormalities. Diagnostic tests: Genetic testing for CTG repeats (DM1) or CCTG repeats (DM2). Prognosis: Variable, with a range of severity; may involve multiple systems. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy Genetics: Autosomal dominant disorder, involving DUX4 gene. Clinical features: Progressive weakness in face, shoulders, and upper arms. Diagnostic tests: Genetic testing for DUX4 gene mutations. Prognosis: Variable, may involve asymmetric muscle weakness. Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy Genetics: Heterogeneous group, both autosomal dominant and recessive forms. Clinical features: Proximal muscle weakness in the pelvic and shoulder girdles. Diagnostic tests: Genetic testing for various associated genes associated. Prognosis: Variable, depending on the specific subtype. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy Genetics: X-linked or autosomal dominant, involving EMD and LMNA genes. Clinical features: Early contractures, muscle wasting, cardiac conduction abnormalities. Diagnostic tests: Genetic testing for EMD and LMNA gene mutations. Prognosis: Cardiac complications can be life-threatening Predefined Questions and Answers for Muscular Dystrophy Q1. What is muscular dystrophy? A. Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic disorders that cause progressive weakening and wasting of the muscles due to mutations affecting muscle structure and function. Q2. What causes muscular dystrophy? A. MD is caused by mutations in genes responsible for healthy muscle proteins. Most forms are inherited, but some cases result from spontaneous gene mutations with no family history. Q3. What are the common symptoms? A. Symptoms include muscle weakness, difficulty walking, frequent falls, trouble climbing stairs, muscle pain or stiffness, and sometimes respiratory or cardiac problems depending on the type. Q4. How is muscular dystrophy diagnosed? A. Diagnosis involves clinical examination, family history, blood tests for muscle enzymes (like creatine kinase), genetic testing, muscle biopsy, and sometimes MRI or electromyography. Q5. Is there a cure for muscular dystrophy? A. Currently, there is no cure. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms, slowing progression, and improving quality of life. Q6. What treatments are available? A. Physical therapy and regular low-intensity exercise to maintain muscle strength. Corticosteroids like prednisone or deflazacort to slow muscle degeneration, though they have side effects. Newer drugs such as eteplirsen target specific genetic defects in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Supportive care for respiratory and cardiac complications. Q7. How does muscular dystrophy affect life expectancy? A. Life expectancy varies by type. For example, Duchenne muscular dystrophy often reduces life expectancy to early adulthood, while other types like oculopharyngeal MD may have normal life expectancy. Q8. Can muscular dystrophy be prevented? A. Since MD is genetic, it cannot be prevented. However, genetic counseling and prenatal testing are options for families with a history of MD. Q9. How can I manage muscular dystrophy daily? A. Management includes physical therapy, assistive devices, respiratory care, cardiac monitoring, and joining support groups for emotional and practical help. Q10. Are there ongoing research and clinical trials? A. Yes, research is ongoing to develop gene therapies, exon-skipping drugs, and other treatments to alter disease progression, especially for Duchenne MD DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY Doctor: Hello, I understand you or your child have been experiencing muscle weakness and difficulty with movement. Let’s talk about what might be going on. Patient/Parent: Yes, we’ve noticed increasing weakness, especially in the legs, and trouble walking. What could be causing this? Doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination, it’s possible you have a type of muscular dystrophy. Muscular dystrophy is a genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness over time. Patient/Parent: Is this something inherited? How serious is it? Doctor: Most types of muscular dystrophy are inherited, often passed down through families, though sometimes a new mutation can occur. The severity and progression vary depending on the type. For example, Duchenne muscular dystrophy usually starts in early childhood and progresses faster, while other types may have a milder course. Patient/Parent: How do you confirm the diagnosis? Doctor: We’ll do some blood tests to check muscle enzymes like creatine kinase, which are often elevated. Genetic testing can identify specific mutations. Sometimes a muscle biopsy or imaging like MRI helps. These tests help us confirm the diagnosis and determine the exact type. Patient/Parent: Is there a cure? Doctor: Currently, there is no cure for muscular dystrophy. However, treatments like physical therapy, medications such as corticosteroids, and newer gene-targeted therapies can help slow progression, improve muscle strength, and maintain quality of life. Patient/Parent: What kind of care will be needed long-term? Doctor: Managing muscular dystrophy requires a team approach, including neurologists, physical and occupational therapists, cardiologists, and respiratory specialists. Regular monitoring helps manage complications like heart and lung issues. Patient/Parent: What can we do at home to help? Doctor: Maintaining gentle exercise and stretching can help keep muscles flexible. Using assistive devices when needed improves mobility and independence. It’s also important to watch for breathing or swallowing difficulties and report them promptly. Patient/Parent: How will this affect life expectancy? Doctor: It depends on the type. Duchenne muscular dystrophy can reduce life expectancy, but with advances in care, people are living longer. Other types may have little or no impact on lifespan. Patient/Parent: Are there any new treatments or research? Doctor: Yes, research is ongoing, including gene therapies and drugs that target specific genetic defects. Clinical trials may be available, and we can discuss if you’re interested. Patient/Parent: Thank you, doctor. This helps us understand what to expect and how to manage the condition. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’ll work together to provide the best care and support for you or your child. Please feel free to ask any questions anytime.

SMA involves the loss of a specific type of nerve cell in your spinal cord called lower motor neurons, or anterior horn cells. These cells control muscle movement. Without these motor neurons, muscles don’t receive the nerve signals that make them move. The weakness in SMA tends to be more severe in the muscles that are close to the center of your body (proximal muscles) than in the muscles farther away from your body’s center (distal muscles). Muscle weakness tends to worsen with time. Types of SMA There are five subtypes of SMA. Healthcare providers classify them based on the age of onset, as well as the severity and life expectancy. The subtypes include: SMA type 0 (congenital SMA): This is a rare subtype that affects a fetus before birth. Pre-birth, there are typically decreased fetal movements. At birth, infants with type 0 have severe muscle weakness and typically go into respiratory failure. Death usually happens at birth or within the first month of life. SMA type 1 (severe SMA): About 60% of SMA cases are type 1 — also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease. Symptoms arise within the first six months of life and include limited head control and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). Infants with type 1 SMA also have difficulty swallowing and breathing. Without breathing support, children with type 1 SMA die before their second birthday. SMA type 2 (intermediate SMA): Symptoms of type 2 SMA (also called Dubowitz disease) appear between six months and 18 months of life. Symptoms include hypotonia and worsening muscle weakness, which tends to affect their legs more than their arms. Children with type 2 SMA may be able to sit up but can’t walk. Around 70% of people with type 2 will survive until 25, with some surviving into their 30s. Respiratory issues are the major cause of death. SMA type 3 (mild): Symptoms of type 3 SMA (also called Kugelbert-Welander disease) appear after a child’s first 18 months of life. Type 3 symptoms include lower limb muscle weakness, leading to difficulty walking. People with type 3 MSA don’t tend to develop breathing issues, and it typically doesn’t affect life expectancy. SMA type 4 (adult): This is the mildest form of SMA. It doesn’t typically appear until after the age of 21. Muscle weakness symptoms progress slowly, so most people with type 4 remain mobile. It typically doesn’t affect life expectancy. Although SMA is thought of as uncommon, it’s the second most common severe hereditary disease of infancy and childhood after cystic fibrosis. Researchers estimate that it affects between 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 11,000 live births. SMA is about twice as common in white and Asian people as it is in Black and Hispanic people. causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) SMA is a genetic condition, which means you inherit genes from your biological parents that cause the condition. Mutations (changes) in the SMN1 (survivor motor neuron 1) gene cause all types of spinal muscular atrophy. The number of copies that you have of the SMN2 gene alters the severity of the condition. A healthy SMN1 gene produces SMN protein. Motor neurons need this protein to survive and function properly. If you have SMA, your body doesn’t make enough SMN protein, so your motor neurons shrink and die. As a result, your brain can’t control voluntary movements, especially motion in your head, neck, chest and legs. The SMN2 gene also produces a small amount of SMN protein. A person may have up to eight copies of an SMN2 gene. Having multiple copies of the SMN2 gene typically leads to less severe SMA symptoms because the extra genes make up for the missing SMN1 protein. Inheritance pattern of SMA You inherit SMA in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both of your biological parents pass on mutations in the SMN1 gene. In most cases, the biological parents of someone with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene. But these carriers typically don’t have symptoms of the condition. In the general population, mutations of the SMN1 gene are common. Among white people, 1 in 50 may be a carrier. In rare cases, you may inherit an SMN1 gene mutation from one parent and acquire a new mutation in the other copy of the gene during embryonic development. symptoms of SMA In general, the main symptom of SMA is muscle weakness — typically, in the muscles closest to the center of your body. But the symptoms vary based on the type. Symptoms of SMA type 0 include: Decreased fetal movements. Arthrogryposis. Decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). Severe muscle weakness. Severe breathing issues. Symptoms of SMA type 1 include: Limited head control. Hypotonia. Lack of reflexes (areflexia). Inability to sit without support. Abnormal breathing pattern and a bell-shaped chest. Difficulty swallowing, which can lead to growth issues (failure to thrive). Facial muscle weakness. This develops later on in the condition. Symptoms of SMA type 2 include: Hypotonia and areflexia. Progressive muscle weakness that affects your child’s legs more than their arms. Scoliosis. Muscle weakness in your child’s chest, which can result in restrictive lung disease. Jerky movements in your child’s hands (polyminimyoclonus). Stiffening of your child’s jaw (mandible) joint due to bone fusion (ankylosis). Joint contractures. Symptoms of SMA type 3 mainly involve progressive muscle weakness that affects your child’s legs more than their arms. The main symptom of SMA type 4 is mild leg weakness. Diagnosis and Tests OF Spinal muscular atrophy To start the diagnosis process, a healthcare provider will ask about your or your child’s medical history and symptoms. They’ll then do physical and neurological exams. If your provider suspects SMA, the main test that can confirm it is genetic testing. This blood test can confirm 95% of SMA cases by identifying problems with the SMN1 gene. Each of the 50 U.S. states now routinely screens newborns for SMA. Some SMA symptoms resemble those of other neuromuscular disorders, like muscular dystrophy. If your provider doesn’t immediately suspect SMA, they may recommend any of the following tests to find the cause: Creatine kinase blood test: Deteriorating muscles release this enzyme into your bloodstream. But the levels are typically normal with SMA, unlike with other neuromuscular disorders. Electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction study: These tests measure the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. Muscle biopsy: Rarely, your provider may request a muscle biopsy. This procedure involves removing a small amount of your muscle tissue and sending it to a lab for examination. Can spinal muscular atrophy be diagnosed during pregnancy? If you’re pregnant and have a family history of SMA, prenatal genetic testing may be able to check if the developing fetus has the condition. Prenatal tests for SMA include: Amniocentesis: During amniocentesis, your healthcare provider inserts a thin needle into your belly to draw out a small amount of amniotic fluid. A pathologist checks the sample for SMA. This test happens after the 14th week of pregnancy. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): Your provider removes a small tissue sample from the placenta through your cervix or belly. A pathologist checks the sample for SMA. CVS can take place as early as the 10th week of pregnancy. Management and Treatment OF Spinal muscular atrophy Unfortunately, there isn’t a cure for SMA. Treatment for SMA mainly seeks to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Symptom management therapies may include: Physical therapy, which can help improve posture, prevent joint immobility and slow muscle weakness. Occupational therapy, which can improve your ability to perform daily tasks. Assistive devices, like orthopedic braces, crutches, walkers and wheelchairs. Therapy for speech and swallowing difficulties. A feeding tube if swallowing is too difficult and/or dangerous. Assisted ventilation for breathing issues. Medications for SMA Between 2016 and 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments that can significantly improve the course of SMA. They include: Disease-modifying therapy: These medications stimulate the production of SMN2 protein. The FDA has approved Nusinersen (Spinraza®) for both children and adults. A healthcare provider injects the medication into the space around your spinal canal. A different medication, risdiplam (Evrysdi®), helps those with SMA who are 2 months and older. You take risdiplam daily by mouth (orally). Gene replacement therapy: Children younger than 2 may benefit from a one-time intravenous (IV) infusion of a medication called onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma®). This therapy replaces a missing or faulty SMN1 gene with a functioning gene. These newer treatments may be particularly effective if started early, even before symptoms of SMA appear. Given the availability of these treatments, there’s now routine screening of newborns for SMA in the United States. Your child may also be able to participate in a clinical trial for SMA. Talk with your child’s healthcare team to see if this is an option. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Treatment Drugs and Their Side Effects 1. Spinraza (Nusinersen) Type: Antisense oligonucleotide Administration: Intrathecal injection (into the spinal canal) Mechanism: Modifies splicing of SMN2 gene to increase production of functional SMN protein Common Side Effects: Headache Back pain Respiratory infections Constipation Risk of thrombocytopenia and renal toxicity (rare) Notes: Requires repeated lumbar punctures; well-established safety profile. 2. Evrysdi (Risdiplam) Type: Oral SMN2 splicing modifier Administration: Oral liquid or tablet form (FDA approved tablet form in 2025) Mechanism: Increases SMN protein production by modifying SMN2 gene splicing Common Side Effects: Fever Diarrhea Rash Mouth ulcers Upper respiratory tract infections Notes: Non-invasive, daily dosing; tablet form improves accessibility and convenience. 3. Zolgensma (Onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) Type: Gene replacement therapy Administration: Single intravenous infusion Mechanism: Delivers functional copy of SMN1 gene via viral vector Common Side Effects: Elevated liver enzymes (hepatotoxicity risk) Vomiting Thrombocytopenia Fever Respiratory infections Notes: One-time treatment; requires monitoring of liver function and platelet counts. 4. Emerging Therapy: Apitegromab (SRK-015) Status: Investigational; FDA priority review expected in September 2025 Mechanism: Myostatin inhibitor that prevents muscle wasting by blocking myostatin activation Potential Side Effects: Under investigation; expected to be well tolerated based on trials. Genomic Data of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Causative Gene: SMA is primarily caused by biallelic mutations or deletions in the SMN1 gene located on chromosome 5q13. This gene encodes the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein essential for motor neuron health. Gene Structure and Homology: The SMN1 gene is highly homologous to a nearly identical paralog, SMN2, which differs by a few nucleotides. The number of SMN2 copies varies between individuals and modulates disease severity because SMN2 produces some functional SMN protein but less efficiently than SMN1. Genetic Variations: Most SMA patients have homozygous deletion of SMN1 (zero copies), which is diagnostic. Some patients have compound heterozygous mutations including deletions and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in SMN1 exons or intron/exon boundaries. Rare cases involve deep intronic mutations or complex rearrangements that are harder to detect. Carrier testing is complicated by the presence of silent carriers who have two copies of SMN1 on one chromosome (2+0 genotype), making standard copy number tests insufficient alone. Copy Number Variation (CNV): The copy number of SMN1 is critical for diagnosis and carrier detection; zero copies indicate SMA, one copy indicates carrier status. The copy number of SMN2 influences disease severity; more copies generally correlate with milder phenotypes. Diagnostic Techniques: Copy number analysis of SMN1 and SMN2 using PCR-based methods or genome sequencing (GS) with specialized algorithms to distinguish SMN1 from SMN2. Long-read sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) enable detailed profiling of SMN1 and SMN2 including SNVs and structural variants. Advanced methods combine microsatellite marker analysis, long-read sequencing, and de novo assembly to resolve complex deletions and improve carrier detection. Outlook / Prognosis OF Spinal muscular atrophy The prognosis (outlook) for someone with SMA varies based on the subtype. Your healthcare team can give you a better idea of what to expect based on your or your child’s situation. Complications of SMA Over time, children with SMA experience progressive muscle weakness and loss of muscle control. Potential complications include: Bone fractures, hip dislocation and scoliosis. Malnutrition and dehydration due to problems eating and swallowing. Chest infections, like aspiration pneumonia, due to swallowing issues. Weak lungs and breathing problems that may require breathing support (ventilation). People with SMA are also prone to metabolic acidosis, especially during periods of illness or fasting. Researchers aren’t sure why this happens. What is the life expectancy of someone with SMA? The life expectancy of someone with SMA largely depends on the type: SMA type 0 results in death at birth or within one month of life. SMA type 1 often results in death by the age of 2 without breathing support. Life expectancy for SMA type 2 varies but is usually between 20 and 40 years. SMA types 3 and 4 typically don’t affect life expectancy. It’s important to note that disease-modifying and gene replacement therapies have been proven to substantially improve survival in SMA type 1. Your healthcare team will be able to give you a better idea of what to expect. Prevention OF Spinal muscular atrophy SMA is an inherited condition, so it’s not typically preventable. But genetic testing can help you understand your odds of having a biological child with SMA. Carrier testing for SMA is available using a genetic test. If you or your partner carry the mutated gene that causes SMA, a genetic counselor can explain the chances of your child having SMA or being a carrier. You may be able to take steps before pregnancy to lower the risk of passing on SMA. A process called preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) identifies embryos that don’t have the mutated gene. Your healthcare provider implants healthy embryos during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Living With Spinal muscular atrophy If your child has SMA, it’s important to advocate for them to ensure they get the best medical care and as much access to therapy as possible. Advocating for care can help them have the best possible quality of life. You and your family may also want to consider joining a support group to meet others who can relate to your experiences. PREDEFINED Questions and answers ON Spinal muscular atrophy Q1. What type of SMA do I or my child have? A. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is typically classified into five main types (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) based on the age of symptom onset and severity. All these types are primarily caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, with the number of copies of the SMN2 gene influencing the severity. SMA Type 0: This is a very rare and severe type where symptoms begin before birth. Infants have severe weakness, and significant difficulty breathing and feeding. Life expectancy is very short, often resulting in death at birth or within one month. SMA Type 1 (Werdnig-Hoffman disease): This is the most common and severe form, with symptoms appearing at birth or by 6 months of age. Infants experience severe muscle weakness, trouble breathing, coughing, and swallowing. Without breathing support, type 1 often results in death by age 2. SMA Type 2 (Intermediate SMA/Dubowitz disease): Symptoms typically begin between 6 and 18 months of age. Children with SMA Type 2 can usually sit without support but cannot stand or walk independently. Muscle weakness is mainly in the proximal muscles, affecting lower limbs more than upper limbs, while face and eye muscles are usually unaffected. Life expectancy for Type 2 varies but is often between 20 and 40 years. SMA Type 3 (Kugelberg-Welander disease): Symptoms appear after 18 months of age and can range from 18 months to adulthood. Individuals can walk independently but may experience difficulty running, climbing stairs, and frequent falls due to proximal weakness. Many may eventually require a wheelchair. Life expectancy is typically comparable to that of the general population. SMA Type 4: This is the mildest and latest-onset form, usually appearing after age 30, though sometimes as early as 18. Symptoms include mild to moderate leg muscle weakness. Patients can achieve motor milestones and maintain mobility throughout life, and their lifespan remains normal. Your healthcare provider will determine the specific type through clinical evaluation and genetic testing. Q2. What\\'s the prognosis for this type of SMA? A. The prognosis for SMA varies significantly by type, primarily depending on the severity and age of onset: SMA Type 0: Extremely poor, with death usually occurring at birth or within the first month. SMA Type 1: Without advanced breathing support, life expectancy is often less than two years. SMA Type 2: Life expectancy is variable, often ranging from 20 to 40 years. SMA Type 3: Typically, life expectancy is normal, although individuals may experience progressive muscle weakness and may eventually need a wheelchair. SMA Type 4: Life expectancy is generally normal, as it is the mildest form. It is important to note that with recent advancements in treatment, the prognosis for all types, especially Types 1 and 2, has improved significantly. Q3. What\\'s the best treatment for this type of SMA? A. The best treatment for SMA is disease-modifying therapy aimed at increasing the production of the SMN protein, which is deficient in all SMA types. The choice of treatment depends on the specific type of SMA, age, and other factors, and your doctor will recommend the most suitable option: Nusinersen (Spinraza): An antisense oligonucleotide that increases SMN protein production. It is administered via intrathecal injection (into the spinal canal). Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma): A gene replacement therapy that delivers a functional copy of the SMN1 gene. It is a one-time intravenous infusion [Search Result 9]. Risdiplam (Evrysdi): An oral medication that also increases SMN protein levels by modifying gene splicing. It is taken daily [Search Result 9]. In addition to these medications, supportive care is crucial for all SMA types, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory support, and nutritional management to address specific symptoms and improve quality of life Q4. What are the treatment risks and side effects? A. Each treatment has specific risks and side effects: Nusinersen (Spinraza): Common side effects include headache, back pain, and respiratory infections. Rare but serious risks can include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and kidney toxicity. It also requires repeated lumbar punctures. Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma): Common side effects include elevated liver enzymes (indicating liver injury), vomiting, and thrombocytopenia. Liver function must be closely monitored before and after treatment. Risdiplam (Evrysdi): Common side effects include fever, diarrhea, rash, and mouth ulcers. It can also cause upper respiratory tract infections. Your healthcare provider will discuss these risks in detail and explain how they will be monitored throughout treatment. Q5. Are other members of my family at risk for getting SMA? If so, should we get genetic tests? A. Yes, SMA is a genetic condition typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that an individual usually inherits two mutated copies of the SMN1 gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. If you have a child with SMA, both biological parents are typically carriers (meaning they each have one healthy copy and one mutated copy of the SMN1 gene). Each child they have together would then have a 25% chance of having SMA, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being neither affected nor a carrier. Other family members, such as siblings of an affected individual, may also be carriers. Genetic testing for carrier status is highly recommended for family members who are considering having children, including parents, siblings, and extended family members, to understand their risk. Genetic counseling can help interpret results and explain family risks. Q6. What type of ongoing care will I or my child need? A. Ongoing care for SMA is multidisciplinary and focuses on managing symptoms, preventing complications, and supporting overall well-being: Neurological follow-ups: Regular visits with a neurologist to monitor disease progression and adjust treatment. Physical and occupational therapy: To maintain muscle strength, flexibility, prevent contractures, and improve daily function. Respiratory care: Monitoring breathing function, and providing respiratory support (e.g., non-invasive ventilation, airway clearance techniques) as needed to prevent and manage respiratory infections. Nutritional support: Monitoring weight and growth and addressing swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) or feeding issues, potentially through feeding tubes. Orthopedic care: Monitoring for scoliosis (curvature of the spine) and joint contractures and considering interventions like bracing or surgery if necessary. Speech and language therapy: For those with swallowing or communication difficulties. Psychological and social support: For patients and families to cope with the challenges of SMA. Q7. What signs of complications should I look out for? A. You should be vigilant for signs of complications, as early detection allows for timely intervention: Respiratory distress: Increased difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, use of accessory muscles for breathing, blue discoloration around the lips or fingertips, or frequent respiratory infections. Feeding difficulties: Choking, gagging, recurrent aspiration, or significant weight loss. Scoliosis: Noticeable curvature of the spine, which can worsen breathing problems. Joint contractures: Joints becoming stiff or difficult to move through their full range of motion. Signs of medication side effects: Such as persistent fever, vomiting, or changes in urine color (if on Zolgensma, indicating liver issues), or severe headache/back pain (if on Nusinersen). Sudden worsening of weakness: Any rapid decline in muscle function or motor skills Epidemiology OF Spinal muscular atrophy Frequency United States The spinal muscular atrophies are the second most common autosomal-recessive inherited disorders after cystic fibrosis. The acute infantile-onset SMA (type I) affects approximately 1 per 10,000 live births; the chronic forms (types II and III) affect 1 per 24,000 births. SMA types I and III each account for about one fourth of cases, whereas SMA type II is the largest group and accounts for one half of all cases. International The incidence of spinal muscular atrophy is about 1 in 10,000 live births with a carrier frequency of approximately 1 in 50. Mortality/Morbidity The mortality and/or morbidity rates of spinal muscular atrophy are inversely correlated with the age at onset. High death rates are associated with early onset disease. In patients with SMA type I, the median survival is 7 months, with a mortality rate of 95% by age 18 months. Respiratory infections account for most deaths. In type II SMA, the age of death varies, but death is most often due to respiratory complications. See Prognosis for more information. Sex Male individuals are most frequently affected, especially with the early-onset forms of spinal muscular atrophy, ie, types I and II. Age According to the ISMAC system, the age of onset for spinal muscular atrophies is as follows: SMA type I (acute infantile or Werdnig Hoffman): Onset is from birth to 6 months. SMA type II (chronic infantile): Onset is between 6 and 18 months. SMA type III (chronic juvenile): Onset is after 18 months. SMA type IV (adult onset): Onset is in adulthood (mean onset, mid 30s). SMA Differential Diagnosis Congenital Muscular Dystrophy Congenital Myopathies Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophies Juvenile Myasthenia Gravis Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (especially for adult-onset SMA type 4) Guillain-Barré Syndrome Transverse Myelitis Pompe Disease (Glycogen Storage Disease type II) Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Prader-Willi Syndrome Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes Fazio-Londe Syndrome Monomelic Amyotrophy Cerebral Palsy (hypotonic diplegia) Progressive Muscular Atrophy DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Spinal muscular atrophy Doctor: Hello, I understand you have some concerns about your child’s muscle weakness. Can you tell me more about what you’ve noticed? Parent: Yes, my baby seems very floppy and has trouble holding up their head. They also don’t move as much as other babies their age. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Based on the symptoms and initial tests, it looks like your child may have a condition called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, or SMA. It’s a genetic disorder that affects the motor neurons, which are the nerve cells that control muscle movement. Parent: Is this something serious? What causes it? Doctor: SMA can vary in severity, but it often causes progressive muscle weakness. It is caused by changes in a gene called SMN1, which leads to a shortage of a protein necessary for motor neuron survival. Because of this, muscles become weaker over time. Parent: How do you confirm this diagnosis? Doctor: We confirm SMA by doing a genetic test that looks for mutations or deletions in the SMN1 gene. This test is very accurate and can tell us the exact type of SMA your child has. Parent: What treatments are available? Can it be cured? Doctor: While there is currently no cure, there are effective treatments that can slow the progression of the disease and improve muscle function. These include medications like Nusinersen (Spinraza), Risdiplam (Evrysdi), and gene therapy (Zolgensma). We also focus on supportive care such as physical therapy and respiratory support. Parent: Are there any risks or side effects with these treatments? Doctor: Yes, each treatment has potential side effects. For example, Spinraza requires injections into the spinal canal and can cause headaches or back pain. Gene therapy can affect liver function, so we monitor that closely. We will discuss these in detail and monitor your child carefully during treatment. Parent: What about other family members? Could they have SMA? Doctor: SMA is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both parents usually carry one copy of the mutated gene. We recommend genetic testing for family members to understand their carrier status and discuss family planning options. Parent: What kind of ongoing care will my child need? Doctor: Your child will need regular follow-ups with a multidisciplinary team including neurologists, physical therapists, respiratory specialists, and nutritionists. We’ll monitor muscle strength, breathing, and nutrition closely to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Parent: What signs should I watch for that mean my child’s condition is getting worse? Doctor: Watch for increased difficulty breathing, swallowing problems, persistent cough, or changes in muscle strength. If you notice any of these, please contact us immediately. Parent: Thank you, doctor. This helps me understand what to expect and how we can help our child. Doctor: You’re very welcome. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns.

These include increased airway resistance, heavy snoring, hypopnea (impaired airflow), or apnea (complete cessation of breathing). The severity of SDB can range from mild airway resistance to severe apnea episodes. These issues affect sleep quality and overall health. Timely recognition and treatment are crucial, as untreated cases can lead to complications like cardiovascular problems and fatigue. What is a sleep disordered breathing child? The term breathing disorders during sleep in children refers to a group of diseases or conditions which involve a disorder in breathing during sleep, from a simple recurring noise to complex obstructive apnea. This disorder is often related to factors such as hypertrophied tonsils or adenoids, obesity, and facial structural abnormalities. Some of the symptoms of SDB include severe snoring, restless sleep, airway obstruction during daytime, mouth breathing, nocturnal enuresis, excessive daytime sleepiness and poor concentration. The assessment usually consists of polysomnography and treatment techniques can range from the removal of diseased adenoids in the throat, dietary control in overweight patients or finally continuous positive airway pressure in very severe conditions. It is important to remember that timely initiation of treatments is crucial in terms of prevention of stunted development and impaired intellectual abilities. Types of sleep disordered breathing Among the different sleep disorders, each has its distinct characteristics and health effects. Snoring Characteristics: Snoring is the sound produced by airflow through the nose and throat being partially blocked. Causing vibrations in surrounding tissues. Causes: It can be caused by several things including nasal congestion, obesity, alcohol, and positions taken while sleeping. Impact on Health: Snoring is mostly not a serious threat. However, it may disrupt sleep to the great discomfort of both the snorer and the snooze partner leading to excessive daytime fatigue and irritability. Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS) Characteristics: UARS is one in which the upper airway collapses somewhat during sleep, increasing respiratory efforts. Causes: Anatomical factors may play a part in UARS such as jaw size and enlarged tonsils. Impact on Health: These can cause frequent awakenings at night, excessive daytime sleepiness, and if not treated, can go on to develop more severe forms of sleep disorder. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Characteristics: OSA is when the airway becomes partially blocked or totally obstructed during sleep, leading to increased respiratory efforts. Causes: Causes can basically be obesity, relaxation of throat muscles, enlarged tonsils, and jaws being set in an unusual position. Impact on Health: Apnea can lead to life-threatening situations such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes because of frequent drops in blood oxygen levels and consequent frequent wakeups during sleep. Central Sleep Apnea (CSA) Characteristics: CSA is a rarer form of Sleep Apnea where the brain does not send the right signals with awesome rhythm. Causes: Certain medical conditions that include heart failure, stroke, and any particular medication may be taken. Impact on Health: It can cause sleep disruption, fatigue, and in extreme cases, worsen cardiovascular problems and promote decline in cognitive activities. Sleep-Related Hypoventilation Disorders Characteristics: In most cases, these disorders involve decreased breathing and shallow breaths during sleep, resulting in high carbon dioxide levels in the blood. Causes: Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), chronic lung disease, and neuromuscular disorders may all cause Hypoventilation. Impact on Health: People with Hypoventilation may suffer from chronic morning headaches. They also experience excessive daytime sleepiness and eventually develop respiratory failure. Sleep-Related Hypoxemia Disorder Characteristics: This is a condition characterized by abnormally low blood oxygen levels during sleep. Causes: Persistent low oxygen levels during sleep occur when someone has lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Impact on Health: Long-term low oxygen levels strain the heart and lungs, leading to complications like pulmonary hypertension, hypertension, and arrhythmias. Sleep Disordered Breathing vs. Sleep Apnea Sleep disordered breathing refers to a group of breathing problems during sleep. But sleep apnea only applies to conditions when breathing pauses entirely or partially in sleep cycles. There are two types of sleep apnea under SDB category: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA). How to Diagnose Sleep Disordered Breathing The diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing spectrum usually requires a sleep study (polysomnography). Where the patient’s breathing, oxygen levels, heart rate, and some other parameters are monitored during sleep. Home sleep apnea testing may also be used, especially for OSA diagnosis. For certain patients, the need for evaluation by a sleep specialist or imaging studies may be warranted to evaluate airway anatomy. Treatment Options for Sleep Disordered Breathing Sleep disordered breathing treatment options depend on both the type and severity of SDB CPAP Machines for OSA: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treats OSA more frequently than any other remedy by being a system of delivering constant air pressure to keep the airway open. Lifestyle Changes: Moderate weight loss and smoking cessation can significantly improve SDB symptoms by lessening the chances of airway occlusion. Surgical Options: In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove or shrink airway tissues (such as tonsils and soft palate) for adequate airflow. Dental Devices and Positional Therapy: Oral appliances can draw the jaw and tongue forward. Positional therapy advises sleeping a certain way such as on one’s side to lessen airway obstruction. Initial Treatment Elimination of contributing factors The first task in treating patients with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is to eliminate all possible contributing factors. This includes weight loss for patients who are obese and elimination of alcohol or sedative use, especially near bedtime. Benzodiazepines, narcotics, and barbiturates can worsen SDB, or sometimes they initiate it where it had not previously been present. A 10% weight loss was associated with a 26% decrease in the respiratory disturbance index (RDI; also referred to as the apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) in a population-based study. Weight loss should be recommended for all obese patients with sleep apnea; however, weight loss takes time, and only a minority of patients successfully maintain it. Alteration of body positioning during sleep Body positioning during sleep can improve SDB in some patients. Because lying supine can allow gravity to assist in pulling lax tongue muscles back toward the posterior pharyngeal wall, patients should sleep on their sides, on their stomachs, or propped up 60°. These positions can improve SDB in patients whose symptoms occur primarily while supine. Avoidance of supine sleeping can easily be accomplished with a sock, tennis ball, and safety pins. The tennis ball in a sock is pinned to the back of the pajamas, positioning the tennis ball between the scapulae. Avoidance of supine sleeping can easily be accomplished with a sock, tennis ball, and safety pins. The tennis ball in a sock is pinned to the back of the pajamas, positioning the tennis ball between the scapulae. When the patient rolls into the supine position during sleep, this lump is uncomfortable enough that the position is immediately shifted, usually without the patient awakening. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy In patients with hypothyroidism and SDB, thyroid hormone replacement therapy is usually accompanied by an improvement in the SDB. Use of oral appliances In some individuals, a mouthpiece may improve the anatomy of the airway to the point where snoring or mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be corrected. Oral appliances, or mandibular advancement devices (MADs), can be an effective alternative for mild and medium-to-moderate OSA syndrome (OSAS), but they require strict monitoring because of differences in individual response to this therapy. Many types of oral appliances have been designed for the treatment of sleep apnea. Most are custom fitted to the teeth of both dental arches to reposition the mandible and to enlarge the retropalatal and retrolingual airway space. However, consistent patient tolerance for this treatment is relatively low, and it is less effective than continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in reducing the frequency of apnea and hypopnea. Restriction or elimination of alcohol use Alcohol significantly worsens SDB. Eliminating use of alcohol, especially near bedtime, improves SDB Diagnostic Considerations OF Sleep disordered breathing The differential diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) includes the following: Simple snoring Central sleep apnea (CSA) Other disorders that cause daytime sleepiness (eg, insufficient sleep, a circadian-rhythm abnormality, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder). Epidemiology OF Sleep disordered breathing Epidemiologic studies indicate that sleep apnea is more common in men than in women (male-to-female ratio, 2-3:1). Sleep apnea occurs in 4% of men and 2% of women aged 30-60 years. A retrospective study on 830 patients with OSAS reported a male-to-female ratio (M:F) that increases with the gravity of the disease: 2.2:1 in mild OSAS and 7.9:1 in severe OSAS. Hypersomnolence is reported with a percentage of 16% in men and 22% in women; 24% of men and 9% of women have an apnea-hypopnea index of at least 5. The discrepancy between the lower prevalence of OSA, the greater frequency of obesity, and the smaller airway size in women compared with men suggests that a gender difference underlies this condition. Men tend to have a larger but more collapsible airway during mandibular movement than women, and this may play a partial role in the positional dependency and severity of OSA in men. Another possible reason for the lower prevalence of OSAS may be reluctance on the part of many women to report symptoms mostly considered inappropriate, like snoring; this reluctance may cause a clinical underestimation of the problem in females. The gender-related protective effect decreases in females who are postmenopausal and not on hormone replacement therapy. The association between age and OSA is complex. Several studies have shown a higher prevalence of OSA in elderly persons than in middle-aged persons, though daytime symptoms may be less common with advancing age. The Sleep Heart Health Study demonstrated that the influence of male sex and body mass index (BMI) on OSA tends to wane with age. For unclear reasons, the overall prevalence of OSA plateaus after age 65 years. The prevalence of OSAS among African American persons seems to be at least equal to and possibly greater than that among white persons. The prevalence among men in urban India and men and women in Korea is similar to that observed in Western countries. Some researchers have noticed an increased incidence of OSA in persons of Asian origin. Prognosis OF Sleep disordered breathing Excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from SDB can impact focus and concentration, causing decreased work effectiveness. Even mild-to-moderate SDB lengthens reaction time, causing performance decreases similar to alcohol intoxication. This can lead to motor vehicle accidents and other serious accidents in situations where alertness is required for safety (e.g., heavy machinery operators). Moderate-to-severe OSA is associated with earlier death. The cardiovascular sequelae of untreated OSA include hypertension, cor pulmonale, arrhythmias, and increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke. SDB is associated with higher levels of IL-6, a marker of myocardial infarction risk and mortality. Adiposity may mediate the increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and P-selectin observed in SDB. OSA is associated with difficult-to-control hypertension. CPAP also reduces markers of hypercoagulability, and this is a potential mechanism by which it can reduce the rate of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in OSAS patients. In heart failure patients with sleep apnea, studies have not shown the use of PAP to reduce the risks of cardiovascular outcomes or death; however, such therapy has been associated with some improvements in OSA symptoms. Treatment of OSA may reduce new first-time cerebrovascular events and recurrences. A study by Gupta et al suggested that in patients with stroke and OSA, CPAP treatment can yield significantly better stroke outcomes and statistically nonsignificant favorable outcomes in terms of recurrence of vascular events. Untreated OSA has been associated with cognitive deficits and changes in brain electrophysiology, and there is evidence to suggest that CPAP may mitigate these effects. Many of the studies examining the relation between OSA and glucose tolerance have shown a direct and independent relation between OSA and diabetes. The Wisconsin Sleep Study Cohort showed a greater prevalence of diabetes in subjects with increasing levels of OSA. Several studies have shown a beneficial effect of CPAP therapy on insulin resistance or glucose levels. The probable mechanisms connecting OSA with glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus include increased sympathetic activity, sympathovagal dysfunction, alterations in neuroendocrine function (especially in growth hormone [GH] and cortisol levels), and a high inflammatory state with an increase in the release of proinflammatory cytokines Predefined Questions and Answers for Sleep Disordered Breathing Q1. What is sleep disordered breathing? A. Sleep disordered breathing refers to abnormal breathing patterns during sleep, including snoring, pauses in breathing (apneas), and shallow breathing (hypopneas) that can disrupt sleep quality and oxygen levels. Q2. What are common symptoms of sleep disordered breathing? A. Loud and frequent snoring Pauses in breathing observed by a bed partner Gasping or choking during sleep Excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue Morning headaches Difficulty concentrating or memory problems Restless sleep or frequent awakenings Q3. How is sleep disordered breathing diagnosed? A. Diagnosis often involves: A detailed sleep history, including questions about snoring, breathing pauses, and daytime symptoms Sleep questionnaires such as the Berlin Questionnaire or STOP-Bang to assess risk Overnight sleep studies (polysomnography) either in a sleep lab or at home to monitor breathing, oxygen levels, and brain activity during sleep Q4. What questions might my doctor ask to assess for sleep disordered breathing? A. Do you snore loudly? Has anyone noticed that you stop breathing or gasp during sleep? Do you wake up feeling short of breath or choking? Do you feel excessively sleepy during the day? Do you have high blood pressure or other cardiovascular conditions? What is your typical sleep schedule and sleep environment like? Q5. What are the risk factors for sleep disordered breathing? A. Obesity Older age Male sex Anatomical factors such as enlarged tonsils, a small jaw, or nasal obstruction Smoking and alcohol use Medical conditions like hypertension, heart failure, or stroke Q6.

Can sleep disordered breathing cause other health problems? A. Yes, untreated sleep disordered breathing can lead to: High blood pressure Heart disease and stroke Diabetes Daytime fatigue increasing risk of accidents Cognitive impairment and mood disorders Doctor-patient conversation about sleep disordered breathing (SDB) Doctor: Hello, I understand you’ve been having some trouble with your sleep. Can you tell me what symptoms you’ve noticed? Patient: Yes, I’ve been snoring loudly, and my partner says I sometimes stop breathing during the night. I also feel very tired during the day, even after a full night’s sleep. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Loud snoring and pauses in breathing are common signs of a condition called obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA. This means your airway may be partially or completely blocked during sleep, causing you to stop breathing briefly. Patient: That sounds serious. How do you confirm if I have sleep apnea? Doctor: The best way to diagnose sleep apnea is through a sleep study, called a polysomnography. It monitors your breathing, oxygen levels, heart rate, and brain activity while you sleep. We can arrange this either at a sleep center or sometimes with a home sleep test. Patient: What happens if I do have sleep apnea? How is it treated? Doctor: Treatment depends on the severity, but the most common and effective treatment is a CPAP machine. It delivers continuous positive airway pressure to keep your airway open during sleep. There are also other options like oral appliances or surgery in some cases. Patient: Are there lifestyle changes I can make to help? Doctor: Absolutely. Losing weight if you’re overweight, avoiding alcohol and sedatives before bedtime, and sleeping on your side instead of your back can all help reduce symptoms. Patient: What are the risks if I don’t treat sleep apnea? Doctor: Untreated sleep apnea can increase your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and daytime accidents due to sleepiness. It can also affect your mood and concentration. Patient: I’d like to get tested. What are the next steps? Doctor: I’ll refer you for a sleep study. Meanwhile, try to keep a sleep diary noting your sleep patterns and symptoms. After the test, we’ll review the results and discuss the best treatment plan for you. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I feel better knowing there’s a way to find out what’s going on and get help. Doctor: You’re welcome. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns before your sleep study. References https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/870192-treatment?&icd=login_success_email_match_fpf CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA Central sleep apnea is a disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. Central sleep apnea occurs because the brain doesn\\'t send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. This condition is different from obstructive sleep apnea, in which breathing stops because the throat muscles relax and block the airway. Central sleep apnea is less common than obstructive sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea can result from other conditions, such as heart failure and stroke. Another possible cause is sleeping at a high altitude. Treatments for central sleep apnea might involve managing existing conditions, using a device to assist breathing or using supplemental oxygen. Causes OF CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA Central sleep apnea occurs when your brain doesn\\'t transmit signals to your breathing muscles. The brainstem links the brain to the spinal cord. It controls many functions, including heart rate and breathing. Central sleep apnea can be caused by a number of conditions that affect the ability of the brainstem to control breathing. The cause varies with the type of central sleep apnea you have. Types include: Cheyne-Stokes breathing. This type of central sleep apnea is most commonly associated with congestive heart failure or stroke. During Cheyne-Stokes breathing, breathing effort and airflow gradually rise and then lessen. During the weakest breathing effort, a total lack of airflow can occur. Drug-induced apnea. Taking certain medicines such as opioids can cause breathing to become irregular or stop completely for a short time. These medicines can be taken by mouth or by shot, also called injection. They include morphine (MS Contin, Mitigo, others), oxycodone (Roxicodone, Oxycontin, others) and codeine. High-altitude periodic breathing. A Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern can occur if you\\'re at a very high altitude. The change in oxygen at a high altitude can cause fast breathing, known as hyperventilation, followed by taking in too little air. Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. Some people with obstructive sleep apnea develop central sleep apnea while using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for treatment. This condition is known as treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. It is a combination of obstructive and central sleep apneas. Medical condition-induced central sleep apnea. Several medical conditions, including end-stage kidney disease and stroke, may lead to central sleep apnea. This type of sleep apnea doesn\\'t involve Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Primary central sleep apnea, also known as idiopathic sleep apnea. The cause of this uncommon type of central sleep apnea is not known. Risk factors OF CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA Certain factors put you at increased risk of central sleep apnea: Sex. Males are more likely to develop central sleep apnea than are females. Age. Central sleep apnea is more common among older adults, especially those older than age 60. This could be because people older than 60 are likely to have other medical conditions or sleep patterns that are linked to central sleep apnea. Heart disorders. Heart problems put people at higher risk of central sleep apnea. An irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation, can increase the risk. Having heart muscles that don\\'t pump enough blood for the body\\'s needs, known as congestive heart failure, also can raise the risk. Stroke, brain tumor or a structural problem with the brainstem. These brain conditions can affect the brain\\'s ability to regulate breathing. High altitude. Sleeping at an altitude higher than you\\'re used to may increase your risk of sleep apnea. High-altitude sleep apnea resolves a few weeks after returning to a lower altitude. Opioid use. Opioid medicines may increase the risk of central sleep apnea. CPAP. Some people with obstructive sleep apnea develop central sleep apnea while using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This condition is known as treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. It is a combination of obstructive and central sleep apneas. For some people, complex sleep apnea goes away with continued use of their CPAP device. Other people may be treated with a different kind of positive airway pressure therapy. Symptoms OF CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA Common symptoms of central sleep apnea include: Observed episodes of not breathing during sleep. Sudden awakenings with shortness of breath. Not being able to stay asleep, known as insomnia. Excessive daytime sleepiness, known as hypersomnia. Trouble focusing. Mood changes. Morning headaches. Snoring. Although snoring suggests some degree of a blocked airway, snoring also can occur in people with central sleep apnea. However, snoring may not be as prominent with central sleep apnea as it is with obstructive sleep apnea. When to see a doctor Consult a medical professional if you have — or if your partner notices — any symptoms of central sleep apnea, particularly: Shortness of breath that awakens you from sleep. Pauses in your breathing during sleep. Trouble staying asleep. Excessive daytime drowsiness, which may cause you to fall asleep while you\\'re working, watching television or even driving. Ask a member of your health care team about any sleep problem that leaves you regularly fatigued, sleepy and irritable. Excessive daytime drowsiness can be due to other disorders, so it\\'s important to get an accurate diagnosis. Sleepiness during the day may be caused by obstructive sleep apnea, by not allowing yourself time to get enough sleep at night or by sudden attacks of sleep, known as narcolepsy. Diagnosis OF CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA A primary care professional might evaluate your condition based on your symptoms. Or you may be referred to a sleep specialist in a sleep disorder center. A sleep specialist can help you decide on your need for further evaluation. That might involve overnight monitoring of your breathing and other body functions during a sleep study called polysomnography. During polysomnography, you\\'re connected to equipment that monitors your heart, lung and brain activity, breathing patterns, arm and leg movements, and blood oxygen levels while you sleep. You may have a full-night or split-night sleep study. In a split-night sleep study, you\\'re monitored during the first half of the night. If you\\'re diagnosed with central sleep apnea, staff might wake you to start a therapy for the second half of the night. The therapy might be positive airway pressure or supplemental oxygen. Polysomnography can help diagnose central sleep apnea. It also can help rule out other sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, repetitive movements during sleep or narcolepsy. These other disorders can cause excessive daytime sleepiness but require different treatment. Doctors trained in nervous system diseases, known as neurologists, and in heart diseases, known as cardiologists, and others might be involved in evaluating your condition. You might need imaging of your head or heart to look for contributing conditions. TREATMENT OF CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA Treatments for central sleep apnea might include: Addressing associated medical problems. Possible causes of central sleep apnea include other disorders. Treating those conditions might help your central sleep apnea. For example, therapy for heart failure might improve central sleep apnea. Reduction of opioid medicines. If opioid medicines are causing your central sleep apnea, your health care team might reduce your dose of those medicines over time. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This method, also used to treat obstructive sleep apnea, involves wearing a mask over the nose or over the nose and mouth while asleep. The mask is attached to a small pump that supplies a continuous amount of pressurized air to hold open the upper airway. CPAP may prevent the airway closure that can trigger central sleep apnea. As with obstructive sleep apnea, in central sleep apnea it\\'s important that you use the CPAP device only as directed. If your mask is uncomfortable or the pressure feels too strong, talk with your health care team. Several types of masks are available. The air pressure also can be adjusted. Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV). If CPAP doesn\\'t effectively treat your condition, you might be given ASV. Like CPAP, ASV also delivers pressurized air. Unlike CPAP, ASV adjusts the amount of pressure breath-by-breath when you take a breath. This smooths out your breathing pattern. The device also might automatically deliver a breath if you haven\\'t taken a breath within a certain number of seconds. ASV isn\\'t recommended for people with symptomatic heart failure. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP). Like ASV, BPAP delivers a set amount pressure when you breathe in and a different amount of pressure when you breathe out. Unlike ASV, the amount of pressure delivered when you breathe in is fixed rather than variable. BPAP also can be set to deliver a breath if you haven\\'t taken a breath within a certain number of seconds. Supplemental oxygen. Using supplemental oxygen while you sleep might help if you have central sleep apnea. Various devices are available to deliver oxygen to your lungs. Medicines. Medicines such as acetazolamide have been used to stimulate breathing in people with central sleep apnea. These medicines might be prescribed to help your breathing as you sleep if you can\\'t tolerate positive airway pressure. Surgery or other procedures A newer therapy for central sleep apnea is transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation. A device approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration known as Remede System delivers an electrical pulse to the nerve that controls the diaphragm during sleep. This causes you to take a breath. The system includes a battery-powered pulse generator that\\'s implanted under the skin in the upper chest. Used for moderate to severe central sleep apnea, this system produces a steady breathing pattern. More study is needed. Diagnostic Considerations OF CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA This discussion includes the differentiation of central sleep apnea from non–central sleep apnea conditions. Obstructive sleep apnea This is a sleep disorder in which recurrent complete or partial upper airway obstruction produces snoring, oxygen desaturations, and numerous arousals. The repetitive upper airway collapse occurs during sleep because negative pressure generated during inspiration is not effectively counteracted by splinting by pharyngeal dilators, especially when narrowing occurs as a result of excessive soft tissue or vulnerable craniofacial anatomy. Patients may report loud snoring, witnessed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Physical examination characteristics often include a crowded oropharynx, increased neck and waist circumferences, and increased body mass index. Further, polysomnography (PSG) demonstrates prominent snoring and obstructive respiratory events (airflow is absent but ventilatory effort persists, as opposed to absent ventilatory effort in central sleep apnea Pseudocentral sleep apnea Patients with diaphragmatic paralysis and other neuromuscular diseases, who are dependent on accessory muscles of breathing to maintain ventilation, may appear to have central apneas during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This is due to the REM atonia of skeletal muscles. Many of these patients actually have obstructive sleep apnea but do not have enough diaphragmatic excursions to be recorded by the piezoelectric belts used during routine PSG. A history of neuromuscular disease and worsening of central apneas during REM sleep should alert to the possibility of pseudocentral apnea. Sleep-related hypoventilation syndrome Sleep-related hypoventilation with central sleep apneas can be observed in many conditions, such as neuromuscular weakness or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These conditions are characterized by a history of a preexisting disorder of hypoventilation, elevated resting PaCO2, and severe oxygen desaturation during sleep, which is more prominent during REM sleep in contrast to primary central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes breathing-central sleep apnea (CSB-CSA), which are mostly observed during NREM sleep. Epidemiology OF CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA US frequency Predominant central apnea is uncommon and is seen in less than 10% of patients presenting for PSG. In the general population, the prevalence of central sleep apnea is less than 1%. CSB-CSA has been reported in 25-40% of patients with heart failure and in 10% of patients who have had a stroke. CSA related to chronic kidney disease has been reported as in up to 10% of patients. Although data is insufficient to establish the prevalence, CSA occurs in neurological disorders with impaired central command and/or peripheral muscle weakness including multiple-system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and neuromuscular disease. One study has reported the prevalence rate of central sleep apnea at 30% in a population of patients in a stable methadone maintenance program. Race No data are available on the racial distribution of central sleep apnea syndromes. Sex CSB-CSA shows a striking male preponderance. Sex distribution in other types of central sleep apnea syndromes has not been studied. Central sleep apnea is uncommon in premenopausal women. One explanation for this discrepancy is the presence of a lower apneic threshold of PaCO2 in women compared with men. Thus, women require a greater reduction in their PaCO2 to initiate apnea than do men. Age Primary central sleep apnea mostly affects middle-aged or elderly individuals. CSB-CSA increases in prevalence among individuals older than 60 years. Age distribution in other central sleep apnea syndromes is unknown Prognosis OF CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA The mortality and morbidity associated with primary central apnea remains unknown; however, these individuals are unlikely to develop significant hypercarbia or hypoxia to the detriment of pulmonary circulation or cor pulmonale. Patients with heart failure and CSB-CSA have a higher mortality rate than those without it. In one study, the 2-year survival rate for patients in heart failure with concomitant CSB-CSA higher than in those without CSB-CSA. A more recent study demonstrated a higher mortality rate in congestive heart failure patients with central sleep apnea than those with no sleep apnea. However, the observed difference was no longer significant after adjusting for age and New York Heart Association functional class. A study of sleep-disordered breathing and nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias in older men documented that the likelihood of atrial fibrillation or complex ventricular ectopy increased along with the severity of sleep-disordered breathing, which included obstructive sleep apnea and CSB-CSA. Different forms of sleep-disordered breathing were associated with different types of arrhythmias, and central sleep apnea was strongly associated with atrial fibrillation/flutter. The odds of atrial fibrillation (P = .01) and of complex ventricular ectopy (P< .001) increased with increasing quartiles of the respiratory disturbance index (a major index including all apneas and hypopneas). Predefined Questions and Answers for Central Sleep Apnea (CSA) Q1. What is central sleep apnea? A. Central sleep apnea is a sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep because the brain fails to send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. This differs from obstructive sleep apnea, which is caused by airway blockage. Q2. What causes central sleep apnea? A. Common causes include heart failure, stroke, brainstem injuries, high altitude, use of opioid medications, and certain neurological conditions. Sometimes, no cause is found (idiopathic CSA). Q3. What are the symptoms of central sleep apnea? A. Symptoms include pauses in breathing during sleep, sudden awakenings with shortness of breath, difficulty staying asleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, trouble concentrating, mood changes, and sometimes snoring (less common than in obstructive sleep apnea). Q4. How is central sleep apnea diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is made through a sleep study (polysomnography) that monitors breathing patterns, oxygen levels, and brain activity during sleep. It helps distinguish CSA from other sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea or narcolepsy. Q5. What treatments are available for central sleep apnea? A. Treatment depends on the cause and severity: Managing underlying conditions (e.g., heart failure) Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapies such as CPAP, BiPAP, or adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) (ASV is contraindicated in some heart failure patients) Supplemental oxygen during sleep Medications like acetazolamide or theophylline in select cases Implantable phrenic nerve stimulation devices for moderate to severe CSA unresponsive to other treatments. Q6. What are the risks or side effects of treatment? A. PAP therapies may cause discomfort, nasal congestion, or dry mouth. Implantable devices carry surgical risks such as infection. Medications can have side effects and require close monitoring. Q7. Can lifestyle changes help with central sleep apnea? A. Avoiding sedatives and opioids, maintaining a healthy weight, and treating underlying medical conditions can help reduce symptoms. Q8. How can I live well with central sleep apnea? A. Education about the condition, adherence to treatment, regular follow-up with your healthcare provider, and support from sleep specialists can improve quality of life DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA Doctor: Hello, I reviewed your sleep study results, and it appears you have a condition called central sleep apnea. This means that during sleep, your brain sometimes doesn’t send the right signals to your breathing muscles, causing pauses in breathing. Patient: I see. How is that different from the sleep apnea I hear about, like obstructive sleep apnea? Doctor: That’s a great question. In obstructive sleep apnea, the airway is physically blocked, so you try to breathe but can’t get air in. In central sleep apnea, the problem is that your brain temporarily stops telling your body to breathe. It’s less common than obstructive sleep apnea but still important to treat. Patient: What causes central sleep apnea? Doctor: It can be caused by several things, including heart failure, certain neurological conditions, or use of some medications like opioids. Sometimes it happens without a clear cause, which we call primary central sleep apnea. Patient: What treatments are available? Doctor: Treatment depends on the cause and severity. We often start with positive airway pressure therapy, like CPAP or adaptive servo-ventilation, to help regulate your breathing during sleep. We’ll also manage any underlying conditions that may contribute. In some cases, supplemental oxygen or medications may be helpful. Patient: Are there any risks or side effects with these treatments? Doctor: Some people find the machines uncomfortable at first, and there can be side effects like nasal dryness or congestion. We’ll work closely with you to adjust the settings and address any issues. Implantable devices are an option for some patients but involve surgery and monitoring. Patient: How will I know if the treatment is working? Doctor: We’ll monitor your symptoms and may do follow-up sleep studies or use remote monitoring to see how well your breathing improves. Many patients notice better sleep quality and less daytime fatigue when treatment is effective. Patient: What should I watch out for or report? Doctor: If you notice worsening daytime sleepiness, new breathing difficulties, or side effects from treatment, please contact us promptly. Also, any new symptoms related to heart or neurological health should be evaluated. Patient: Thank you. It helps to understand what’s going on and what to expect. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’ll support you throughout your treatment and are here to answer any questions along the way.

People with obstructive sleep apnea repeatedly stop and start breathing while they sleep. There are several types of sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the throat muscles relax and block the airway. This happens off and on many times during sleep. A sign of obstructive sleep apnea is snoring. Treatments for obstructive sleep apnea are available. One treatment is a device that uses positive pressure to keep the airway open during sleep. Another option is a mouthpiece to thrust the lower jaw forward during sleep. In some people, surgery might be an option too. Causes OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat relax too much to allow for proper breathing. These muscles support the back of the roof of the mouth, known as the soft palate. The muscles also support the tongue and side walls of the throat. When the muscles relax, the airway narrows or closes as you breathe in. This can lower the level of oxygen in the blood and cause a buildup of carbon dioxide. Your brain senses this impaired breathing and briefly rouses you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway. This awakening is usually so brief that you don\\'t remember it. You may awaken with shortness of breath that corrects itself quickly, within one or two deep breaths. Or you might make a snorting, choking or gasping sound. This pattern can repeat itself 5 to 30 times or more each hour, all night long. These disruptions impair your ability to reach the deep, restful phases of sleep, and you\\'ll probably feel sleepy during your waking hours. People with obstructive sleep apnea might not be aware of their interrupted sleep. Many people with this type of sleep apnea don\\'t realize they haven\\'t slept well all night. Risk factors OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA Anyone can develop obstructive sleep apnea. However, certain factors put you at increased risk, including: Excess weight. Most but not all people with obstructive sleep apnea are overweight. Fat deposits around the upper airway can obstruct breathing. Medical conditions that are associated with obesity, such as hypothyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome, also can cause obstructive sleep apnea. Older age. The risk of obstructive sleep apnea increases as you age but appears to level off after your 60s and 70s. Narrowed airway. A naturally narrow airway is a trait that can be passed down in your family. Or your tonsils or adenoids might become enlarged and block your airway. High blood pressure, known as hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea is relatively common in people with hypertension. Chronic nasal congestion. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs twice as often in those who have consistent nasal congestion at night, regardless of the cause. Smoking. People who smoke are more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea. Diabetes. Obstructive sleep apnea might be more common in people with diabetes. Male sex. In general, men are 2 to 3 times more likely as premenopausal women to have obstructive sleep apnea. However, the risk of obstructive sleep apnea increases in women after menopause. A family history of sleep apnea. Having family members with obstructive sleep apnea might increase your risk. Asthma. Research has found an association between asthma and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea. Symptoms OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include: Excessive daytime sleepiness. Loud snoring. Observed episodes of stopped breathing during sleep. Waking during the night and gasping or choking. Awakening in the morning with a dry mouth or sore throat. Morning headaches. Trouble focusing during the day. Mood changes, such as depression or being easily upset. High blood pressure. Decreased interest in sex. When to see a doctor Consult a health care professional if you have, or if your partner observes, the following: Snoring loud enough to disturb your sleep or the sleep of others. Waking up gasping or choking. Pausing in your breathing during sleep. Having excessive daytime drowsiness. This may cause you to fall asleep while working, watching television or even driving a vehicle. Snoring doesn\\'t necessarily indicate something potentially serious, and not everyone who snores has obstructive sleep apnea. Be sure to talk to a member of your health care team if you snore loudly, especially if your snoring is interrupted by periods of silence. Snoring may be loudest — and breath pauses known as apneas may be more common — when you sleep on your back. Ask your health care team about any sleep problem that leaves you fatigued, sleepy and irritable on a regular basis. Excessive daytime drowsiness may be due to other disorders, such as narcolepsy. Diagnosis OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA A member of your health care team evaluates your condition based on your symptoms, an exam, and tests. You may be referred to a sleep specialist for further evaluation. The physical exam involves an examination of the back of your throat, mouth and nose. Your neck and waist circumference may be measured. Your blood pressure also may be checked. A sleep specialist can further evaluate you. The specialist can diagnose and determine the extent of your condition. The specialist also can plan your treatment. The evaluation might involve staying at a sleep center overnight. At the sleep center, your breathing and other body functions are monitored as you sleep. Tests Tests to detect obstructive sleep apnea include: Polysomnography. During this sleep study, you\\'re hooked up to equipment that monitors your heart, lung and brain activity and breathing patterns while you sleep. The equipment also measures arm and leg movements and blood oxygen levels. You might be monitored all night or part of the night. If you\\'re monitored for part of the night, it\\'s called a split-night sleep study. In a split-night sleep study, you\\'ll be monitored during the first half of the night. If you\\'re diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, staff members may wake you and give you continuous positive airway pressure for the second half of the night The sleep study also can help look for other sleep disorders that can cause excessive daytime sleepiness but have different treatments. The sleep study can uncover leg movements during sleep, known as periodic limb movement disorder. Or the study can help evaluate people who have sudden bouts of sleep during the day, known as narcolepsy. Home sleep apnea testing. Under certain circumstances, you may have an at-home version of polysomnography to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea. Home sleep apnea testing kits monitor a limited number of variables to detect breathing pauses during sleep. TREATMENT OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA Positive airway pressure. If you have obstructive sleep apnea, you may benefit from positive airway pressure. In this treatment, a machine delivers air pressure through a piece that fits into your nose or is placed over your nose and mouth while you sleep. Positive airway pressure reduces the number of times you stop breathing as you sleep. The therapy also reduces daytime sleepiness and improves your quality of life. The most common type is called continuous positive airway pressure, also known as CPAP (SEE-pap). With this treatment, the pressure of the air breathed is continuous, constant and somewhat greater than that of the surrounding air. The pressure of the air is just enough to keep your upper airway passages open. This air pressure prevents obstructive sleep apnea and snoring. Although CPAP is the most successful and commonly used method of treating obstructive sleep apnea, some people find the mask uncomfortable or loud. However, newer machines are smaller and less noisy than older machines. And there are a variety of mask designs for individual comfort. Also, with some practice, most people learn to adjust the mask to obtain a comfortable and secure fit. You may need to try different types to find a suitable mask. Several options are available, such as nasal masks, nasal pillows or face masks. If you\\'re having trouble tolerating pressure, some machines have special adaptive pressure functions to improve comfort. You might also benefit from using a humidifier along with your CPAP system. CPAP may be given at a continuous pressure, known as fixed. Or the pressure may be varied, known as autotitrating positive airway pressure (APAP). In fixed CPAP, the pressure stays constant. In autotitrating CPAP, the levels of pressure are adjusted if the device senses increased airway resistance. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) is another type of positive airway pressure. BPAP delivers a preset amount of pressure when you breathe in and a different amount of pressure when you breathe out. CPAP is more commonly used because it\\'s been well studied for obstructive sleep apnea and has been shown to effectively treat the condition. People who have difficulty tolerating fixed CPAP might want to try BPAP or APAP. Don\\'t stop using your positive airway pressure machine if you have problems. Check with your health care team to see what adjustments you can make to improve its comfort. In addition, contact your health care team if you still snore despite treatment, if you begin snoring again, or if your weight goes up or down by 10% or more. Mouthpiece, known as an oral device. Though positive airway pressure is often an effective treatment, oral appliances are an alternative for some people with mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea. They\\'re also used for people with severe sleep apnea who can\\'t use CPAP. The devices may reduce sleepiness and improve quality of life. These devices are designed to keep the throat open. Some devices keep the airway open by bringing the lower jaw forward, which can sometimes relieve snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. Other devices hold the tongue in a different position. If you decide to explore this option, you\\'ll need to see a dentist experienced in dental sleep medicine appliances for the fitting and follow-up therapy. A number of devices are available. Close follow-up is needed to ensure successful treatment and that use of the device doesn\\'t cause changes to your teeth. A newer device uses electrical stimulation on the tongue. The device helps improve snoring and breathing during sleep in people with very mild sleep apnea and snoring. This device isn\\'t meant to be used in place of CPAP when it\\'s recommended for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. It\\'s a removable device that you place around your tongue while you\\'re awake. It delivers electrical impulses to improve the muscle tone of the tongue. This helps prevent the tongue from collapsing and blocking the airway during sleep. The device is used for 20 minutes a day. It takes six weeks to see improvement. A dentist makes a custom device that fits you. Only a small number of studies has looked at how well these devices work. Larger studies are still needed. Don\\'t use a tongue muscle stimulation device if you have a pacemaker or another implanted electrical device. Surgery or other procedures Surgery is usually considered only if other therapies haven\\'t been effective or haven\\'t been appropriate options for you. Surgical options may include: Surgical removal of tissue. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is a procedure in which a surgeon removes tissue from the back of the mouth and top of the throat. The tonsils and adenoids may be removed as well. UPPP usually is performed in a hospital and requires a medicine that puts you in a sleep-like state. This medicine is called a general anesthetic. Upper airway stimulation. This new device is approved for use in people with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who can\\'t tolerate CPAP or BPAP. A small, thin impulse generator, known as a hypoglossal nerve stimulator, is implanted under the skin in the upper chest. When you inhale, the device stimulates the nerve that controls the movement of the tongue. The tongue moves forward instead of moving backward and blocking the throat. Studies have found that upper airway stimulation greatly improves obstructive sleep apnea symptoms and quality of life. Jaw surgery, known as maxillomandibular advancement. In this procedure, the upper and lower parts of the jaw are moved forward compared with the rest of the facial bones. This enlarges the space behind the tongue and soft palate, making obstruction less likely. Surgical opening in the neck, known as a tracheostomy. You may need this form of surgery if other treatments have failed and you have life-threatening obstructive sleep apnea. During a tracheostomy, a surgeon makes an opening in the neck and inserts a metal or plastic tube for breathing. Air passes in and out of the lungs, bypassing the blocked air passage in your throat. Other types of surgery may help reduce snoring and sleep apnea by clearing or enlarging air passages, including: Nasal surgery to remove polyps or straighten a crooked partition between the nostrils, called a deviated septum. Surgery to remove enlarged tonsils or adenoids. Lifestyle and home remedies OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA In many cases, self-care may be the most appropriate way for you to deal with obstructive sleep apnea. Try these tips: Lose weight. If you\\'re overweight or obese, even moderate weight loss may help relieve constriction of your airway. Losing weight also can improve your health and quality of life and might reduce your daytime sleepiness. Exercise. Exercising, such as aerobic exercise and strength training, can help improve your condition. Aim to exercise about 150 minutes a week, and generally try to exercise most days of the week. Don\\'t drink alcohol or use some anti-anxiety medicines or sleeping pills. Alcohol, some anti-anxiety medicines and some sleeping pills can worsen obstructive sleep apnea and sleepiness. Sleep on your side or stomach rather than on your back. Sleeping on your back can cause your tongue and soft palate to rest against the back of your throat and block your airway. To prevent sleeping on your back, try sewing a tennis ball in the back of your pajama top or place pillows behind you to keep you sleeping on your side. Keep your nasal passages open while you sleep. If you have congestion, use a saline nasal spray to help keep your nasal passages open. Talk to a member of your health care team about using nasal decongestants or antihistamines, because some medicines may be recommended for only short-term use. Complications OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA Obstructive sleep apnea is considered a serious medical condition. Complications can include: Daytime fatigue and sleepiness. Because of a lack of restorative sleep at night, people with obstructive sleep apnea often have severe daytime drowsiness, fatigue and irritability. They might have difficulty concentrating and find themselves falling asleep at work, while watching TV or even when driving. This can put them at higher risk of work-related accidents. Children and young people with obstructive sleep apnea might do poorly in school and commonly have attention or behavior problems. Cardiovascular problems. Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during obstructive sleep apnea increase blood pressure and strain the cardiovascular system. Many people with obstructive sleep apnea develop high blood pressure, which can increase the risk of heart disease. The worse the obstructive sleep apnea, the greater the risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart failure and stroke. Obstructive sleep apnea also increases the risk of heart rhythm problems known as arrhythmias. Arrhythmias can lower blood pressure. If there\\'s underlying heart disease, these repeated multiple episodes of arrhythmias could lead to sudden death. Complications with medicines and surgery. Obstructive sleep apnea also is a concern with certain medicines and general anesthesia. Medicines such as sedatives, some prescription painkillers and general anesthetics, relax the upper airway and can make obstructive sleep apnea worse. If you have obstructive sleep apnea, having major surgery can worsen breathing problems. This is especially true if you have been sedated and you were lying on your back. People with obstructive sleep apnea might be more prone to complications after surgery. Before you have surgery, tell your surgeon if you have obstructive sleep apnea or symptoms related to the condition. You may need to get tested for obstructive sleep apnea before surgery. Eye problems. Some research has found a connection between obstructive sleep apnea and certain eye conditions, such as glaucoma. Eye complications can usually be treated. Sleep-deprived partners. Loud snoring can keep those around you from getting good rest and eventually disrupt your relationships. Some partners choose to sleep in another room. People with obstructive sleep apnea also may complain of memory problems, morning headaches, and mood swings or depression. They also may need to urinate often at night. Obstructive sleep apnea might be a risk factor for COVID-19. People with obstructive sleep apnea have been found to be at higher risk for developing a severe form of COVID-19. They may be more likely to need hospital treatment than do those who don\\'t have obstructive sleep apnea. Outlook / Prognosis Untreated OSA may reduce your life expectancy and increase your risk of dangerous complications. But OSA is a treatable condition. A healthcare provider is the best person to talk to about what you can expect, as this answer is very unique to you. What’s the outlook for obstructive sleep apnea? The outlook for OSA depends on many factors like the severity and whether you have other underlying conditions, too. However, you can expect a positive outcome if you stick to your treatment plan after you and your healthcare provider find one that works best for you. Prevention You can’t prevent all cases of OSA. But you can take steps to reduce your risk and improve your overall sleep by: Eating nutritious foods and participating in regular physical activities Maintaining a healthy weight Practicing good sleep hygiene (like setting a bedtime routine and turning off electronic devices before bed) Managing any existing health conditions, such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes Not smoking and not drinking beverages that contain alcohol before bed Seeing your healthcare provider annually for a check-up Predefined Questions and Answers for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Q1. What is obstructive sleep apnea? A. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder where the airway becomes partially or completely blocked during sleep, causing breathing pauses, snoring, and disrupted sleep. Q2. What are the common symptoms of OSA? A. Symptoms include loud snoring, gasping or choking during sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, difficulty concentrating, and restless sleep. Q3. How is OSA diagnosed? A. Diagnosis is made through a sleep study (polysomnography) that monitors breathing, oxygen levels, heart rate, and brain activity during sleep. Home sleep apnea tests may be used in some cases. Q4. What causes obstructive sleep apnea? A. Causes include excess weight, enlarged tonsils, a small jaw or airway, nasal congestion, alcohol or sedative use, and certain medical conditions like hypothyroidism. Q5. What treatments are available for OSA? A. The primary treatment is positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, such as CPAP, which keeps the airway open during sleep. Other treatments include lifestyle changes (weight loss, avoiding alcohol), oral appliances, and surgery in severe cases. Q6. How does a CPAP machine work? A. A CPAP machine delivers a steady stream of pressurized air through a mask to keep your airway open while you sleep, reducing apneas and improving sleep quality. Q7. What lifestyle changes can help manage OSA? A. Weight loss, avoiding alcohol and sedatives before bedtime, quitting smoking, and sleeping on your side instead of your back can reduce symptoms. Q8. What are the risks if OSA is left untreated? A. Untreated OSA increases the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, daytime accidents due to sleepiness, and reduced quality of life. Q9. How can I adjust to using a CPAP machine? A. It may take time to get used to the mask and machine. Communicate any discomfort or issues with your healthcare provider, who can help with mask fitting and adjustments. Q10. Should I see a sleep specialist? A. If you have symptoms like loud snoring, daytime sleepiness, or witnessed breathing pauses, seeing a sleep specialist for evaluation and possible sleep study is recommended Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Treatment Drugs and Their Side Effects 1. Modafinil (Provigil) and Armodafinil (Nuvigil) Use: Promote wakefulness in patients with residual daytime sleepiness despite CPAP therapy. Mechanism: Central nervous system stimulants that enhance alertness. Side Effects: Headache Nausea Nervousness or anxiety Insomnia Rare serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) Notes: Do not treat the underlying apnea; only improve wakefulness. 2. Solriamfetol (Sunosi) Use: Treat excessive daytime sleepiness in OSA patients who remain sleepy despite primary therapy. Mechanism: Dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Side Effects: Headache Nausea Anxiety Insomnia Increased blood pressure and heart rate Notes: Requires monitoring of cardiovascular status. 3. Tirzepatide (Zepbound) Use: Recently FDA-approved for moderate to severe OSA, primarily via weight loss effects as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Side Effects: Nausea Diarrhea Decreased appetite Injection site reactions Notes: Weight loss can improve OSA severity. 4. Other Off-label or Investigational Drugs Theophylline: A bronchodilator with mild stimulant effects; limited use due to side effects. Acetazolamide: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor; may improve breathing stability but limited by side effects like metabolic acidosis. Dronabinol: Cannabinoid receptor agonist; some evidence for reducing apnea events but not widely used. Antidepressants and nasal decongestants: Occasionally used but evidence is limited. Non-Pharmacologic Treatments (Primary Therapy) CPAP: Delivers continuous positive airway pressure to keep airways open. Side effects include nasal dryness, congestion, discomfort, and mask intolerance. Oral appliances: Mandibular advancement devices for mild to moderate OSA. Surgery: For anatomical causes or CPAP intolerance (e.g., hypoglossal nerve stimulation). Lifestyle changes: Weight loss, positional therapy, avoiding alcohol and sedatives Diagnostic Considerations OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA A diagnosis of narcolepsy may be delayed if obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is considered the only condition. Patients should be routinely screened clinically for symptoms of narcolepsy. These patients do not typically have normal sleepiness when OSA has been treated; they may experience improvement in sleepiness, but it is important to question the diagnosis of sleepiness due to OSA despite ideal treatment. Indices for sleep-disordered breathing The indices commonly used to assess sleep disordered breathing (SDB) are the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the respiratory disturbance index (RDI). The AHI is defined as the average number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour. The RDI is defined as the average number of respiratory disturbances (obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory event–related arousals [RERAs]) per hour. If the AHI or RDI is calculated based on less than 2 hours of continuous recorded sleep, the total number of recorded events to calculate the AHI or RDI during sleep testing is at least the number of events that would have been required in a 2-hour period. No universal consensus exists on whether the AHI or the RDI should be the standard index used to determine treatment by specialists and insurance carriers, with Medicare being the most confusing as it varies by region as to whether AHI and RDI can be used. This needs to be resolved as soon as possible. One study found that 30% of symptomatic patients would have been left untreated if the AHI were used rather the RDI. In the authors’ view, the RDI is preferable to the AHI because it includes flow-limitation events that end with arousals. The RDI is better suited to meet the new American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) diagnostic criteria for OSA (see below). One study has demonstrated that use of the Diagnostic criteria for OSA A positive test for OSA is established if either of the following criteria using the AHI or the RDI is met: AHI or RDI greater than or equal to 15 events per hour, or AHI or RDI greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 14 events per hour with documented symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS); impaired cognition; mood disorders; insomnia; or documented hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or history of stroke The AASM has developed its own criteria, as listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders: Diagnostic and Coding Manual, Second Edition. At least 1 of the following criteria must apply for OSA to be diagnosed: The patient reports daytime sleepiness, unrefreshing sleep, fatigue, insomnia, and/or unintentional sleep episodes during wakefulness. The patient awakens with breath holding, gasping, or choking. The patient’s bed partner reports loud snoring, breathing interruptions, or both during the patient’s sleep. Polysomnography (PSG) shows more than 5 scoreable respiratory events (eg, apneas, hypopneas, RERAs) per hour of sleep and/or evidence of respiratory effort during all or a portion of each respiratory event. PSG shows more than 15 scorable respiratory events (eg, apneas, hypopneas, RERAs) per hour of sleep and/or evidence of respiratory effort during all or a portion of each respiratory event. Another current sleep disorder, medical or neurologic disorder, medication use, or substance use does not better account for the patient’s condition. Accreditation of sleep centers by the AASM is critical because there are still more centers that are unaccredited than there are centers that have chosen to meet the highest standards in the field (as evidenced by achieving AASM accreditation). Whether AASM accreditation translates into insurance companies deciding to pay for studies performed at an AASM-accredited center has yet to be determined, although in the authors’ opinion, payment should depend on achieving AASM accreditation. Diagnostic considerations include the following: Chronic insufficient sleep Dyspnea due to pulmonary edema Idiopathic hypersomnia Nocturnal panic attacks Nonobstructive alveolar hypoventilation Obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (pickwickian syndrome) Periodic limb movement disorder Simple snoring Approximately 25% of narcoleptic persons also have obstructive sleep apnea ) Differential Diagnoses OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA Asthma Central Sleep Apnea Syndromes Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Depression Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Hypothyroidism Narcolepsy Periodic Limb Movement Disorder Epidemiology OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA SDB is common in the United States. The National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research estimated that minimal SDB (RDI >5) affects 7-18 million people in the United States and that relatively severe cases (RDI >15) affect 1.8-4 million people. The prevalence increases with age. SDB remains undiagnosed in approximately 92% of affected women and 80% of affected men. OSA is increasingly prevalent, in both adults and children, in modern society. The estimated prevalence has been 2% for women and 4% for men. Similar data have been found in an epidemiologic study from Pennsylvania. More recent research indicates a prevalence of 4% for women and 9% for men. Data from the Wisconsin Cohort Study indicate that the prevalence of OSA in people aged 30-60 years is 9-24% for men and 4-9% for women. The prevalence in children is less certain, but the author’s sleep center is seeing increasing numbers of adolescent patients, who are often obese and present similarly to many of their adult counterparts, with the important exception that they may be sleepy and/or hyperactive. A 2007 study has suggested that approximately 6% of adolescents have weekly SDB. International statistics The prevalence of OSA in non-American populations has only been studied in men and has been found to be as low as 0.3% (England) and as high as 20-25% (Israel and Australia). The prevalence of OSA in Australian men is estimated to be 3%. Age distribution for OSA Aging is an important consideration of risk for OSA. OSA prevalence increases 2-3 times in older persons (>65 y) compared with individuals aged 30-64 years, with an estimated rate as high as 65% in a community sample of people older than 65 years. After age 65 years, no further relative disparity is noted in the incidence of OSA. One explanation for this plateau is the relative increase in mortality in persons older than 65 years; however, data to support this contention, as attractive as it appears, are insufficient. Scant data are available to help clinicians determine if clinical management should differ between the age cohorts. Sex distribution for OSA The male-to-female ratio in community-based studies is 2-3:1. Androgenic patterns of body fat distribution (deposition in the trunk, including the neck area) predispose men to OSA. In general, sex hormones may affect neurologic control of UA-dilating muscles and ventilation. In population studies that have examined the incidence of OSA, women were not only less likely than men to have OSA but also less likely to be diagnosed early in the disease process. Survival rates are lower for women than for men, after an OSA diagnosis has been established by PSG, presumably due to the delayed OSA diagnosis. Three large epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of OSA in women appears to increase after menopause. In these studies, women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) had a prevalence similar to that of premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women are 3 times more likely to have moderate-to-severe OSA compared with premenopausal women. Women who are on HRT are half as likely to have OSA compared with postmenopausal women who are not on HRT. Premenopausal women with OSAHS tend to be more obese than men with the same severity of disease. Thin women with symptoms of OSAHS appear to have an increased frequency of craniofacial abnormalities. Evidence indicates that women underreport the symptoms of loud snoring and witnessed apneas, leading to underreferral to sleep centers. This may explain the marked male predominance (male-to-female ratio of approximately 8:1) in sleep center–based studies. Additionally, women have lower AHIs than men, even after correcting for other demographic factors such as BMI and neck circumference. Prevalence of OSA by race or ethnicity African American individuals appear to be more predisposed to SDB than white persons. This increased predisposition varies according to age. The odds ratio is greater than 3 in children younger than 13 years and is 1.88 in persons younger than 25 years. In elderly African Americans, the risk is increased 2-fold. Examination of craniofacial morphology found that brachycephaly is associated with an increased AHI in whites but not in African Americans. Chinese patients with OSA have a more crowded upper airway and relative retrognathia compared with their white counterparts, with statistical controls for BMI and neck circumference. Asians are known to have a shorter cranial base and a more acute cranial base flexure, increasing OSA risk, with BMI and neck circumference being roughly equal. Therefore, interestingly, obesity plays a more prominent role in OSA predisposition in whites than in Chinese persons. This may serve to underscore the role that craniofacial factors have in Chinese patients. Other populations that may be at increased risk include Mexican Americans and Pacific Islanders. Guidelines Summary OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA The AASM Scoring Manual also provides guidance on standard montages, electrode placements and technical and digital specifications. The recommendations for the indications and performance of polysomnography include the following : Sleep stages are recorded via an electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, and chin electromyogram Heart rhythm is monitored with a single-lead electrocardiogram Leg movements are recorded via an anterior tibialis electromyogram Breathing is monitored, including airflow at the nose and mouth (using both a thermal sensor and a nasal pressure transducer), effort (using inductance plethysmography), and oxygen saturation The breathing pattern is analyzed for the presence of apneas and hypopneas (as per definitions standardized by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine) The guidelines include the following strong recommendations: Clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms should not be used to diagnose OSA in adults without polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing (HSAT). Polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, should be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients with clinical signs of an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA. When a single HSAT is negative, inconclusive, or technically inadequate, polysomnography should be performed for the diagnosis of OSA. Polysomnography should be used for the diagnosis of OSA in adults with significant cardiorespiratory disease, potential respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular condition, awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep-related hypoventilation, chronic opioid medication use, history of stroke or severe insomnia. In 2021 the AASM published guideline on referral for surgical therapy with the following recommendations : Referral to a sleep surgeon for alternative treatments should be discussed with patients with BMI < 40 kg/m2 if the patient\\'s adherence and tolerance does not support adequate PAP or if the patient rejects PAP. Referral to a bariatric surgeon should be discussed with adults with OSA and obesity as an alternative treatment option if the patient\\'s adherence and tolerance does not support adequate PAP or if the patient rejects PAP. Discussion regarding a referral to both sleep and bariatric surgeons to discuss management options may be appropriate in patients with a BMI range of 35–40 kg/m2. PAP should be the initial therapy for adults with OSA and a major upper airway anatomic abnormality prior to referral for upper airway surgery DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA Doctor: Hello, I’ve reviewed your symptoms and test results, and it looks like you have obstructive sleep apnea. This means that during sleep, your airway is partially blocked, causing pauses in breathing and disrupted sleep. Patient: I see. What causes this blockage? Is it serious? Doctor: The blockage can be due to several factors like excess weight, enlarged tonsils, or anatomical differences in your airway. It is serious because these breathing pauses can lower oxygen levels and disrupt your sleep, leading to daytime fatigue and increasing risks for heart disease, high blood pressure, and other health problems. Patient: How do you confirm this diagnosis? Doctor: The diagnosis is confirmed with a sleep study, called polysomnography, which monitors your breathing, oxygen levels, and sleep stages overnight. Sometimes a home sleep test is sufficient, depending on your situation. Patient: What treatment options do I have? Doctor: The most effective treatment is usually a CPAP machine, which delivers continuous air pressure to keep your airway open while you sleep. There are also oral appliances that reposition your jaw, lifestyle changes like weight loss and avoiding alcohol before bedtime, and in some cases, surgery. Patient: I’m worried about using a CPAP machine. Is it hard to get used to? Doctor: It can take some time to adjust, but we’ll work with you to find a mask that fits well and address any discomfort. Many patients find their sleep quality improves significantly once they get used to it. Also, involving your bed partner in this process can help with motivation and adherence. Patient: Are there any other things I should do to improve my condition? Doctor: Yes, losing weight if you’re overweight, sleeping on your side instead of your back, avoiding sedatives or alcohol before bed, and managing any nasal congestion can all help reduce symptoms. Patient: What happens if I don’t treat this? Doctor: Untreated OSA can lead to serious complications like high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and increased risk of accidents due to daytime sleepiness. So, treatment is very important. Patient: Thank you, doctor. What’s the next step? Doctor: I’ll refer you for a sleep study if you haven’t had one yet, and once we have the results, we’ll discuss the best treatment plan tailored to you. Meanwhile, try to note your sleep patterns and any symptoms you experience. Patient: I appreciate that. I feel better knowing there are options. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Please reach out anytime with questions or concerns.

Viral infections are the most common cause of the condition. Croup causes swelling of your child’s voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea). This swelling causes the airway below their vocal cords to narrow, which makes their breathing noisy and difficult. Croup in babies is most common, along with children younger than 3 years old. As children get older, croup isn’t seen as often. This is because their windpipes get larger and swelling is less likely to get in the way of their breathing. Croup causes a distinctive cough that may sound similar to the call of a seal. The condition is usually mild, but symptoms can become severe and life-threatening. RSV vs. croup — what’s the difference? RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and croup are both respiratory illnesses that can affect babies and young children. RSV is a viral infection that can affect both children and adults. It causes coughing, sneezing and other cold-like symptoms. While RSV is its own illness, the respiratory syncytial virus is also one of the viruses that can lead to croup. Whooping cough vs. croup — what’s the difference? Whooping cough (pertussis) and croup are both respiratory infections that can affect babies and children. Both conditions cause a distinctive cough, although the sound of whooping cough is a more high-pitched gasping or “whooping” noise. Whooping cough is a bacterial infection whereas a viral infection usually causes croup. Therefore, no vaccines can prevent croup and antibiotics can’t treat it. (Antibiotics can’t kill viruses.) There’s a vaccine to prevent whooping cough, but it doesn’t go away quickly on its own as croup usually does. Croup affects about 3% of U.S. children every year. The condition accounts for 7% of all hospitalizations in children younger than 5 years old. It’s more common in males. Healthcare providers define about 85% of croup cases as mild. They consider less than 1% of cases severe. Symptoms and Causes OF Croup The croup cough sounds like a harsh “barking” sound. This is the most common symptom of croup. Your child may also have stridor, which is a raspy, vibrating sound that occurs when your child is breathing in. Croup is typically mild and lasts less than one week, but symptoms can get more severe. Symptoms normally start slowly and may begin with a runny or stuffy nose. Over the next 12 to 48 hours, symptoms can worsen, and the barking cough may start. Symptoms are usually worse at night. Other mild croup symptoms include: Hoarseness. Fever. Rash. Eye redness (conjunctivitis). Swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms of moderate to severe croup may include: Difficulty breathing. Restlessness or nervousness. Retractions (sucking in the skin around your child’s ribs and the top of their breastbone). Cyanosis (blue-tinged skin). What causes croup? The most common cause of croup is a viral infection. Croup viruses include parainfluenza, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles and adenovirus. Viral croup causes your child’s upper airways to swell, making it difficult for them to breathe. However, these viruses are common and most children with viral infections don’t develop croup. Rarely, bacteria can complicate the viral infection and make it more difficult to breathe. Is croup contagious? Yes, croup is highly contagious because the viruses that lead to the condition are easily spreadable. How do you get croup? The viruses that cause croup spread easily through the air. When someone with a viral or bacterial infection that can cause croup sneezes or coughs, they send respiratory droplets containing croup-causing germs into the air. When your child breathes in these droplets, they can catch an illness that’ll cause croup. Your child can also get croup by touching objects contaminated by germs that can cause croup. How long is croup contagious? Your child is contagious for three days after their symptoms first appeared or until their fever is gone. You should keep your child home from school until 24 hours have passed without a fever and without using fever-reducing medication. Complications of croup Most cases of croup are mild and you can treat them at home. Complications of croup are rare. Less than 5% of children with croup need in-hospital care. Your child’s condition may lead to hospitalization if they: Need oxygen therapy to keep their oxygen levels within a safe range. Have severe dehydration that requires IV (intravenous, or through your vein) fluids. Need multiple doses of inhaled breathing treatments to provide relief. Have severe symptoms despite initial treatment. Diagnosis and Tests OF Croup You can usually tell if your child has croup based on their signs and symptoms. The most common symptoms are a barking cough and stridor. This condition is especially widespread in the fall and winter months. If your child’s condition is severe, a healthcare provider may order X-rays and laboratory tests, but this is rare. Management and Treatment OF Croup Croup treatment depends on the severity of your child’s condition and the risk of it rapidly worsening. If your child has a history of respiratory problems or was born prematurely, that may also affect the treatment approach. Mild croup You can usually treat mild croup at home. Home treatment includes using a cool mist humidifier to help soothe dry and irritated airways. You can also sit with your child in a bathroom filled with steam generated from hot water running in the shower. (Don’t sit in the shower or let your child near the hot water.) If your child’s condition doesn’t improve with mist treatment, you should contact their healthcare provider. Other croup home remedies include: Letting your child breathe cool air at night by opening a door or window. Treating your child’s fever with an over the counter (OTC) medication such as acetaminophen (Tylenol®) or ibuprofen (Advil®). Treating your child’s cough with warm, clear fluids to help loosen the mucus on their vocal cords. Avoiding smoking in your home, as smoke can worsen your child’s cough. Keeping your child’s head elevated with an extra pillow. (Don’t use pillows with infants younger than 12 months old.) You may wish to sleep in the same room as your child so you’re there if they start to have trouble breathing. Moderate to severe croup For moderate to severe croup, you should take your child to the nearest urgent care center or emergency room (ER). Severe croup can be life-threatening, and you shouldn’t delay taking your child in. Treatment for moderate to severe croup will vary based on your child’s symptoms. Croup treatments may include: Humidified air or oxygen. IV fluids for dehydration. Monitoring of vital signs, including oxygen levels, breathing and heart rate. Croup medication, including steroids (glucocorticoids) and nebulized breathing treatments (epinephrine). Placement of a breathing tube (mechanical ventilation). This is rare. Specific croup medication If you take your child to their provider’s office or the emergency room, their provider will give them a glucocorticoid and a nebulized breathing treatment (epinephrine). Glucocorticoids Glucocorticoids are a type of steroid that decreases the swelling of your child’s voice box (larynx), typically within six hours of the first dose. For a child with mild croup, glucocorticoids may reduce the need for a repeat visit to their provider’s office or the emergency room. The glucocorticoids healthcare providers use most often are dexamethasone and prednisolone. Your child will usually only need one dose taken by mouth (orally). If your child is vomiting or can’t keep the medicine down, their provider can also give dexamethasone intravenously (IV) or through an intramuscular (IM) injection. Nebulized breathing treatment (epinephrine) Your child will receive epinephrine as an inhaled mist (nebulizer). This also reduces the swelling in your child’s airways and usually starts working within 10 minutes. Epinephrine works for two hours or less, and your child may receive this treatment every 15 to 20 minutes for severe symptoms. Complications/side effects of the treatment Serious side effects of epinephrine are rare. However, side effects could include a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia). A healthcare provider will monitor your child for three to four hours after their last dose to ensure symptoms of airway blockage don’t return. How soon after treatment will my child feel better? Glucocorticoids usually start working within six hours of the first dose. Epinephrine typically begins working faster than glucocorticoids. Outlook / Prognosis OF Croup Croup can be mild, moderate or severe, depending on how difficult it is for your child to pull air into their lungs. The size (diameter) of their windpipe and the amount of narrowing due to the swelling determine the severity of your child’s condition. In addition, your child’s condition may become more severe if they become upset. Mild croup A child with mild croup may have a barking cough and stridor. Symptoms can worsen throughout your child’s illness, especially during the evening hours. So it’s important to keep an eye on their breathing, but you can usually treat their condition at home. Moderate croup A child with moderate croup may have stridor along with retractions (sucking in the skin around their ribs and the top of their breastbone). They may also be slightly agitated or disoriented and may have moderate trouble breathing. You should take your child to see a healthcare provider for treatment. Severe croup A child with severe croup has stridor and retractions. They may also be agitated, anxious or fatigued. Cyanosis (blue-tinged skin) is common. Severe croup is a life-threatening condition. Take your child to the emergency room immediately. How long does croup last? Symptoms of croup usually clear up in most children within two days. However, symptoms can persist for up to one week. When can my child go back to school? Croup is very contagious. Your child should stay home from school until after their fever is gone. Prevention OF Croup Croup can spread by physical contact or through the air. To help prevent its spread: Wash and dry your hands thoroughly after caring for your child. Wash toys between each use. Encourage your child to cover their mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing. Keep your child home from school or daycare when they’re ill or if outbreaks occur. Throw used tissues away. When should I take my child to see their healthcare provider? You should call your child’s healthcare provider if: Your child has a fever that lasts for more than three days. Your child has symptoms of mild croup that last for more than one week. You have questions or are concerned about your child’s condition. If your child develops symptoms of severe or worsening croup, seek immediate medical attention. These symptoms include: Difficulty breathing. Blue-tinged skin (cyanosis). Severe coughing spells. Drooling or difficulty swallowing. Inability to cry or speak due to trouble taking a breath. A noisy, high-pitched whistling sound while breathing. Sucking in the skin around your child’s ribs and the top of their breastbone (retractions). PREDEFINED Questions and answers ON Croup Q. Why does my child keep getting croup? A. If your child keeps getting croup, it may be a sign they have a narrowing in their airway and that they’re at a higher likelihood to be affected by the infection. Your child may have been born with the narrowing, or it may have developed after birth. If croup returns (recurs) repeatedly, your child’s provider may refer them to a specialist such as an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat doctor) or a pulmonologist (breathing and lung disease doctor). Q. Can adults get croup? A. Adults can get croup, but it’s rare. The reason babies and young children get croup is because their windpipes (tracheas) are narrower and not fully developed. As children get older, their windpipes get larger and fully develop, so any swelling is less likely to affect breathing. Adults have larger airways, so croup doesn’t typically affect them. When adults do get croup, their symptoms are usually worse and they may need more aggressive treatment. Diagnostic Considerations OF Croup Although croup is considered the most common cause of stridor and respiratory distress in the pediatric population, diagnostic differentials should be considered, dependent on clinical history and presenting symptoms, and include the following: Spasmodic croup (recurrent croup, afebrile) Retropharyngeal abscess Subglottic stenosis Angioedema Allergic reaction Tracheomalacia Laryngeal web Laryngeal papillomatosis Laryngeal hemangioma Subglottic hemangioma Vocal cord paralysis Uvulitis Innominate artery compression Right aortic arch vascular ring Double aortic arch Aberrant subclavian artery Pulmonary artery sling Gastroesophageal reflux (diagnostic consideration for recurrent croup) Rarer etiologies in the pediatric population: Laryngeal tuberculosis, neoplasm (compressing trachea), sarcoidosis, Wegener granulomatosis Differential Diagnoses Bacterial Tracheitis Inhalation Injury Laryngeal Fractures Laryngomalacia Measles Pediatric Airway Foreign Body Pediatric Diphtheria Pediatric Epiglottitis Pediatric Mononucleosis and Epstein-Barr Virus Infection Pediatric Peritonsillar Abscess EPIDEMIOLOGY OF Croup The majority of patients with croup, more than 85%, exhibit mild symptoms, and severe croup is rare, fewer than 1%. In the United States, croup accounts annually for approximately 7% of pediatric hospitalizations, with fewer than 3% of admitted cases requiring intubation, and contributes to up to 15% of emergency department visits among children younger than 5.[5] Croup typically affects children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, but can occur as early as 3 months and up to 15 years. The annual incidence is approximately 532 cases per 100,000 individuals, affecting 3% of children younger than 5 globally. Croup rarely occurs in adults. PIV is responsible for more than two-thirds of croup infections. Croup is more common in boys than in girls, with a 1.5:1 ratio, and shows no preference for any race. Croup is more prevalent in resource-limited countries, likely due to a higher proportion of children younger than 6 and suboptimal nutritional status Croup Treatment Drugs and Their Side Effects 1. Corticosteroids (Dexamethasone and Prednisolone) Use: Reduce airway swelling and inflammation in croup. Proven to decrease hospital admissions, shorten hospital stays, and reduce severity of symptoms. Usually given as a single oral dose; sometimes repeated if symptoms persist. Common Side Effects: Vomiting Upset stomach Restlessness Headache Hiccups (rare) Safety: Short courses (single dose or up to 5 days) have minimal to no significant side effects. Well tolerated and considered very safe in children with croup. Administration: Oral syrup or liquid form. Sometimes given as an injection if oral intake is difficult. 2. Epinephrine (Adrenaline) Nebulized Use: For moderate to severe croup with significant airway obstruction. Rapidly reduces airway swelling with effects starting within 10 minutes but lasting less than 2 hours. Typically administered in hospital settings. Common Side Effects: Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) Nervousness or jitteriness Rare serious side effects; patients are monitored closely after administration. Notes: Multiple doses may be given every 15-20 minutes if needed. Observation for several hours after last dose is standard to watch for symptom recurrence. 3. Supportive Treatments (Not Drugs but Important) Pain and Fever Relief: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen can be used to reduce fever and ease discomfort. Aspirin should not be given to children under 16. Avoid: Cough medicines and decongestants, as they do not help and can cause dangerous drowsiness. Steam inhalation is no longer recommended. Pain relief for children Children’s paracetamol can ease pain and may help lower your child’s temperature if they have a fever. Children under 16 years of age should not be given aspirin. Speak to your pharmacist or GP if you are unsure about what type of pain relief is right for your child. Do not use cough medicines or decongestants. These do not help ease the symptoms of croup. These treatments often have drowsy side effects, which can be dangerous when a child has breathing difficulties. Hospital treatment In severe cases of croup, treatment in hospital may be needed. This might include your child being given adrenaline or oxygen. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Croup Doctor: Hello, I understand your child has been coughing and having some noisy breathing. Can you tell me more about what you’ve noticed? Parent: Yes, my child has a harsh, barking cough and sometimes sounds like they’re struggling to breathe, especially at night. They also have a hoarse voice. Doctor: Based on what you’re describing, it sounds like your child has croup. Croup is a common viral infection that causes swelling around the vocal cords and windpipe, which leads to that barking cough and noisy breathing. Parent: Is it serious? Should I be worried? Doctor: Most cases of croup are mild and get better on their own within a few days. However, sometimes the swelling can make breathing harder, which is why we monitor symptoms carefully. If your child is having trouble breathing, is very restless, or is drooling and unable to swallow, those are signs to seek emergency care immediately. Parent: What can we do to help them feel better? Doctor: The main treatment is a steroid medicine called dexamethasone, which reduces the swelling in the airway. It’s usually given as a single dose and works quite quickly. For more severe breathing difficulty, we might use a nebulized epinephrine treatment in the hospital to open up the airway. Parent: Are there any side effects from the steroid? Doctor: Steroids like dexamethasone are very safe when used in a single dose for croup. Some children might feel a bit restless or have a mild upset stomach, but serious side effects are very rare. Parent: Is there anything I can do at home to help? Doctor: Keeping your child calm is very important because crying can make breathing harder. Make sure they stay hydrated. Sometimes, cool mist or sitting with your child in a steamy bathroom can help soothe their airway, but avoid hot steam or smoke exposure. Parent: When should I bring my child back or go to the emergency room? Doctor: If your child has persistent noisy breathing even when calm, is struggling to breathe, has blue lips or face, is very sleepy or difficult to wake, or starts drooling and can’t swallow, please seek emergency care immediately. Parent: Thank you, doctor. That helps me feel more prepared. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’ll give you the steroid medication today and keep an eye on your child. If you notice any worrying signs, don’t hesitate to come back or call us.

Your baby’s body is still growing, and the parts that support breathing are still developing. So, your baby isn’t quite ready to breathe in a normal rhythm yet. Instead, they have periods where they don’t breathe (apnea). Providers call these periods apneic spells. It can feel very scary to think your baby isn’t breathing right. But this condition is common among preterm babies. And providers know how to treat it. Your baby needs to spend some time in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Providers monitor your baby’s vital signs and give them treatments to support breathing. Your baby can likely go home once they can breathe normally without treatments. Apnea of prematurity causes Apnea of prematurity occurs because your baby’s airways and center for breathing in the brain aren’t fully developed yet. These parts of your baby’s body work together to allow them to breathe. Providers divide apnea in newborns into three main types according to what’s causing the breathing pauses: Obstructive Central Mixed Obstructive apnea This is when there’s a blockage in your baby’s airways. These passages carry oxygen-rich air into your baby’s lungs and remove carbon dioxide from their body. Your baby’s airways need to stay open wide enough to let air pass through. But your baby’s airways (typically, the part that passes through their neck) may not be developed enough to stay open all the time. This can cause breathing pauses. Central apnea This is when your baby’s brainstem (the center in the brain responsible for breathing) doesn’t send out certain signals when expected. Normally, your baby’s brainstem sends signals to your baby’s respiratory muscles (like their diaphragm and intercostal muscles). These muscles help your baby’s lungs pull in and push out air so they can breathe. But if your baby’s brainstem isn’t fully developed yet, it’s not ready to send out signals in a predictable or reliable way. This can lead to pauses in breathing. Mixed apnea This is when your baby’s airways and brainstem aren’t working as expected. It’s the most common type of apnea among preterm infants. Symptoms of apnea of prematurity Apnea of prematurity signs and symptoms include: Pauses in breathing that last 15 to 20 seconds or longer Slow heart rate (bradycardia) Low blood-oxygen level (hypoxemia), which can cause your baby’s skin to look blue, white, yellow-gray or gray — especially the lips and/or tongue (cyanosis) Your baby may have breathing pauses that are shorter than 15 seconds. Providers consider these symptoms of apnea if they occur along with bradycardia and/or hypoxemia. It’s important to distinguish these pauses from periodic breathing. Periodic breathing involves short pauses (less than 10 seconds) with no bradycardia or low oxygen level, followed by rapid breathing, and is considered normal. Diagnosis and Tests OF Apnea of prematurity Healthcare providers diagnose apnea of prematurity in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This is an area of the hospital for babies who need extra care and medical attention. If your baby is born preterm, they may need to spend some time in the NICU before they can go home. While your baby is in the NICU, providers monitor their: Heart rate Breathing Blood-oxygen level Monitors go off if your baby’s heart rate drops or their breathing pauses for a certain amount of time. Data from these monitors — along with nurses’ observations — help providers diagnose apnea. Apnea in newborns is sometimes a sign of other medical conditions. These include metabolic disorders, brain bleeds and infections. Providers check your baby for signs and symptoms of other medical conditions. They rule out all other causes before diagnosing your baby with apnea of prematurity. An apnea of prematurity diagnosis means your baby’s breathing pauses are due to early birth. Their nervous system and respiratory system aren’t fully developed yet. So, your baby needs a little extra help with breathing until their body is ready to handle things on its own. Management and Treatment OF Apnea of prematurity Apnea of prematurity treatment typically includes one or both of the following: Medications (usually caffeine citrate) Breathing support Caffeine for apnea of prematurity Caffeine citrate is a medication providers use to treat apnea of prematurity. Just like your morning coffee gives you a jolt, this medicine stimulates your baby’s nervous system. This “wake-up call” helps your baby’s brainstem and nerve cells send signals that regulate breathing. Caffeine helps your baby have fewer apneic spells. It also helps shorten these pauses in breathing. Breathing support Your baby’s upper airway (pharynx and larynx) might need a little help staying open. If this is the case, providers often use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). With CPAP, your baby is still breathing on their own. But tiny prongs in their nose send air through their airway. This lowers the risk of breathing pauses from airway blockages. If your baby continues to have severe apneic spells, they may need mechanical ventilation. This means a machine (a ventilator) does the work of breathing for your baby until their body can take over Apnea of Prematurity (AOP) Treatment Drugs and Their Side Effects Apnea of Prematurity is a common condition in preterm infants characterized by pauses in breathing due to immature respiratory control. Pharmacological treatment primarily involves respiratory stimulants, especially methylxanthines. 1. Caffeine Citrate Mechanism: Stimulates the central nervous system, enhancing respiratory drive by improving brainstem signaling to respiratory muscles. Dosage: Typical loading dose is 20 mg/kg (oral or IV), followed by maintenance doses of 5-10 mg/kg daily. Efficacy: Preferred treatment due to effectiveness, wide therapeutic window, and ease of administration. Reduces apnea episodes and need for mechanical ventilation. Side Effects: Generally well tolerated. Possible side effects include tachycardia (increased heart rate), feeding intolerance, jitteriness, and irritability. Rarely, may cause seizures or arrhythmias at high doses. Monitoring: Plasma levels usually not required due to predictable pharmacokinetics. 2. Theophylline / Aminophylline Mechanism: Similar to caffeine; methylxanthines that stimulate respiratory centers. Dosage: Theophylline has a narrower therapeutic window; aminophylline is often used intravenously as a theophylline source. Efficacy: Effective but less favored due to more frequent dosing and need for plasma level monitoring. Side Effects: Tachycardia (more pronounced than caffeine). Feeding intolerance, irritability, tremors. Risk of toxicity including seizures and arrhythmias. Monitoring: Requires frequent plasma level monitoring due to narrow therapeutic index. 3. Doxapram Mechanism: Respiratory stimulant acting on carotid body chemoreceptors and central nervous system. Use: Considered a third-line agent, used when caffeine and CPAP fail. Efficacy: Some studies show improved apnea control; used cautiously. Side Effects: Hypertension, irritability, tachycardia. Potential for serious side effects; requires close monitoring. Notes: Not widely used due to limited safety data. 4. Supportive Treatments Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP): Helps keep airways open and reduce obstructive apnea components. Mechanical Ventilation: For severe cases where spontaneous breathing is inadequate. Non-pharmacological: Tactile stimulation during apnea episodes, optimizing positioning, and treating underlying conditions Genomic Data and Genetic Basis of Apnea of Prematurity (AOP) Strong Genetic Component: Multiple studies, including twin studies, indicate a high heritability of AOP, with genetic factors accounting for approximately 87% of the variance among same-gender twins. In particular, genetic influence is stronger in male twins (up to 99%) compared to females (around 78%). Twin Studies: Research comparing monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins shows that if one identical twin has AOP, the other twin has an 87% chance of also having it, whereas this concordance is 62% in fraternal twins, supporting a significant genetic predisposition. Genetic Polymorphisms: Specific gene polymorphisms, especially in adenosine receptor genes (A1, A2A, A2B), have been linked to both the risk of developing AOP and variability in response to caffeine therapy, the main pharmacologic treatment. Some polymorphisms in the A2A receptor gene are associated with increased risk of apnea. Variants in A1 receptor gene correlate with better response to caffeine treatment. Polymorphisms in A2A and A2B receptors also influence the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common comorbidity Outlook / Prognosis OF Apnea of prematurity Apnea of prematurity is a temporary condition. Symptoms improve as your baby grows. Your baby may need to spend several weeks — or even a couple of months — in the NICU. They’ll receive care not just for their breathing but also for any other issues related to preterm birth. Providers will tell you how long your baby needs to stay in the NICU. They’ll also explain what needs to happen for your baby to safely head home. In general, providers identify when it’s safe to stop giving your baby treatments. Then, after stopping treatment, they monitor your baby to see how their body responds. Your baby needs to go a certain number of days without apnea symptoms in order for providers to send them home. The length of this “observation period” depends on how early your baby was born and their overall health. Most babies don’t need continued monitoring with devices at home. But if your baby does need monitoring, providers will explain exactly what’s involved. Ask if anything is unclear or you’re concerned about caring for your baby at home. Providers will make sure you get the information you need to feel comfortable with this transition. Diagnostic Considerations OF Apnea of prematurity Apnea of prematurity (AOP) is a diagnosis of exclusion. For many diseases in preterm infants, apnea is a presenting symptom. The causes of these diseases are different when the differential diagnosis occurs shortly after birth compared with later in the patient\\'s hospital stay. Other etiologies must be sought before drug and/or ventilatory therapies for apnea of prematurity are started. Conditions associated with apnea Shortly after birth, apnea can be a manifestation of several types of conditions. Consider the following: Respiratory distress syndrome and other pulmonary conditions Infections (eg, congenital pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, fetal or neonatal inflammatory response syndrome) Hypoglycemia and other metabolic diseases CNS pathology (eg, trauma, intracranial hemorrhage, anoxia and/or ischemia, stroke) The aforementioned brain insults may be noticed because patients may have seizures and/or associated apnea. Some of the diseases cited above also occur relatively late during the hospitalization of prematurely born infants, but the signs and symptoms may or may not include apnea. Intraventricular hemorrhage and posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus without seizures increases the frequency of apnea in preterm infants. Other conditions associated with apnea in preterm infants during their hospitalization Nosocomial bacterial or fungal infection Apnea, bradycardia, and desaturations are presenting symptoms of nosocomial infections caused by bacteria and fungi or viral agents. In a study of 9 infants in an NICU who had respiratory syncytial viral infection, 8 had apnea as a manifestation of disease. Apnea is also common in preterm infants with Ureaplasma urealyticum infection Necrotizing enterocolitis In addition, apnea is one of several signs and symptoms associated with the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis. Systemic inflammation It is well known to the caregivers in the NICU that premature infants who present with a cluster of multiple episodes of apnea, bradycardia, and desaturations could be showing signs of developing sepsis. During the sepsis, the inflammatory mediators and cytokines play a major role in the development of apnea bradycardia and desaturations. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) attenuates the sensitivity of the carotid body, which leads to the development of apnea, bradycardia, and desaturations. Exposure to magnesium The administration of magnesium to prevent seizures in preeclampsia and tocolysis of preterm labor has been associated with hypoventilation, apnea, and other adverse effects in preterm infants.Hypermagnesemia during parenteral nutrition has also been a cause of apnea. Anemia Disagreement exists regarding the role of clinically significant anemia in the development of apnea among convalescing preterm infants. Westkamp and colleagues reported that blood transfusions lowered heart and respiratory rates but had little effect on apnea of prematurity Bell and associates conversely found that liberal versus restrictive blood transfusion significantly reduced apnea. The interest in the adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes observed in preterm infants with anemia and low iron status emphasizes neonatology-related awareness of the problem. Anemia, apnea of prematurity, and blood transfusion The etiology of apnea in a premature infant is a multifactorial; however, it is a common practice to transfuse packed red blood cells in an infant who is anemic and having multiple episodes of apnea and bradycardia. Many studies have shown conflicting results, as many variables play a role in the pathogenesis of apnea of prematurity. One retrospective study found that packed red blood cell transfusion reduces the number of apneic events in premature infants, with many limitations.When anemia of prematurity and apnea of prematurity occur in conjunction, clinicians are more inclined to transfuse at higher hematocrit levels in affected infants than in infants without apnea of prematurity. Zagol et al observed more cardiopulmonary events during the 72 hours period prior to the blood transfusion compared to 72 hours after the transfusion. Clinicians should judge the merits of transfusion. Surgery Postoperative apnea occurs in preterm infants, particularly those whose intraoperative pain relief involved general anesthesia Additional research is required to determine whether spinal anesthesia, different analgesic agents, or caffeine can mitigate morbidity associated with apnea after surgery in prematurely born infants. Immunization Apnea transiently increases or recurs in hospitalized preterm infants after immunization. The increase in apnea has been attributed to the whole-cell pertussis component. Investigators have observed reduced morbidity with newer vaccines that contain acellular pertussis.Some reports still identified clinically significant apnea and other adverse events. Eye examination Premature infants routinely undergo screening eye evaluations for retinopathy of prematurity in the NICU. Note that approximately 19% to 25% of infants experience an increased number of apneic spells after these routine eye examinations. Gastroesophageal reflux As stated earlier, controversy exists regarding the role of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) as a causative factor in apnea of prematurity. One perspective is that the two conditions are related. Laryngeal edema identified during fiberoptic laryngeal endoscopy has been associated with GER, and antireflux surgery has dramatically reduced apnea in preterm infants at highest risk. Past research failed to reveal a temporal relationship between GER and apnea of prematurity. Therefore, the NICHD Review Group on Apnea of Prematurity has called for additional investigations with rigorous research designs. Skin-to-skin contact, or kangaroo care Skin-to-skin contact, or kangaroo care, for preterm infants has been associated with an increased occurrence of apnea, bradycardia, and desaturation; this appears to be unrelated to hyperthermia. The observation suggests that obstructive events may occur during skin-to-skin contact. These findings call attention to the importance of environmental hyperthermia as a cause of apnea in preterm infants. No adverse events appear to occur during kangaroo care. The disparity among the reported studies may be related to the specific practice of skin-to-skin care in a particular NICU or the validity of monitoring during skin-to-skin contact. Differential Diagnoses OF Apnea of prematurity Anemia of Prematurity Neonatal Sepsis Pediatric Respiratory Failure Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Epidemiology OF Apnea of prematurity United States data Although not always apparent, apnea of prematurity is the most common problem in premature neonates. Approximately 70% of babies born before 34 weeks of gestation have clinically significant apnea, bradycardia, or O2 desaturation during their hospital stay. The more immature the infant, the higher his or her risk of apnea of prematurity. Apnea may occur during the postnatal period in 25% of neonates who weighed less than 2500 g at birth and in 84% of neonates who weigh less than 1000 g. Carlo and Barrington showed that apnea may begin on the first day of life in neonates without respiratory distress syndrome.However, apnea of prematurity is always a diagnosis of exclusion. Many diseases manifest with apnea on the day of birth; examples are intrapartum magnesium exposure, systemic infections or the fetal inflammatory response syndrome, pneumonia, intracranial pathology, seizures, hypoglycemia, and other metabolic disturbances. Approximately 50% or more of surviving infants who weighed less than 1500 g at birth have episodes of apnea that must be managed with pharmacologic intervention or ventilatory support. Mixed apnea accounts for about 50% of all cases of apnea in premature neonates; about 40% are central apneas, and 10% are obstructive apneas. These percentages vary in different reports. In 50% of all apneic episodes, an obstructive component precedes or follows central apnea, which leads to mixed apnea. International data To the authors\\' knowledge, no investigators have compared the incidence of apnea of prematurity in the United States with those of other countries. Race-, sex-, and age-related demographics The authors know of no systematic, prospective clinical study that has been conducted to evaluate the role of a person\\'s race/ethnic background or sex on the incidence of apnea of prematurity. A young gestational age at birth is associated with an increased incidence of apnea of prematurity. The age at which apnea of prematurity resolves depends on several factors. The mean time for severe apnea of prematurity to resolve is approximately 43 weeks after conception, but a prolonged duration of risk is not uncommon. In one report, about 6-22% of babies with a very low birth weight had apnea at term. Approximately 91% of premature neonates had apnea of longer than 12 seconds at the time of hospital discharge. Of these babies, 31% also had bradycardia, and 6.5% required prolonged hospitalization because of the severity of their apnea and bradycardia. These findings show that apnea of prematurity does not resolve at term in many low birth weight infants and that it may persist for some time after hospital discharge. Procedures OF Apnea of prematurity Several studies may reveal diagnostic findings in selected infants. These include fiberoptic examination of the larynx through the nose during spontaneous breathing, direct laryngoscopy, and bronchoscopy (which is usually performed with the patient under anesthesia). Emergency or scheduled tracheostomy may be used to manage severe airway obstruction caused by a number of conditions. Tracheostomy might occur after the airway is stabilized by using endotracheal intubation. Jaw-distraction surgery has been used to avoid tracheostomy in neonatal conditions (eg, Robin sequence) that involve severe micrognathia as a component of malformation. DOCTOR PATIENT CONVERSATION ON Apnea of prematurity Doctor: Hello, I want to talk with you about your baby’s breathing. Since your baby was born prematurely, they have a condition called apnea of prematurity. This means your baby sometimes stops breathing for short periods because their respiratory system is still immature. Parent: That sounds scary. How long do these pauses last, and how often do they happen? Doctor: Apnea is defined as a pause in breathing lasting 20 seconds or more, or shorter pauses that cause the heart rate to slow down or oxygen levels to drop. These episodes can happen frequently, especially in babies born before 35 weeks of gestation. It usually starts a couple of days after birth and tends to improve as the baby matures, often resolving by around 37 to 44 weeks postmenstrual age. Parent: How do you monitor these breathing pauses? Doctor: We use cardiorespiratory monitors that track your baby’s breathing, heart rate, and oxygen levels continuously. If the baby stops breathing or their heart rate drops below certain thresholds, the monitor alerts us so we can intervene quickly. Parent: What treatments are available? Will my baby need medicine? Doctor: Treatment depends on how severe and frequent the apnea episodes are. For mild cases, supportive care like keeping your baby’s environment warm, positioning the head and neck properly, and ensuring clear nasal passages can help. For more significant apnea, we use respiratory stimulants like caffeine, which helps the brain regulate breathing better. If needed, nasal CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) can keep the airway open. In rare cases, if these treatments don’t work, more intensive support like mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Parent: Are there side effects from the caffeine or other treatments? Doctor: Caffeine is generally safe and well tolerated. Some babies may experience mild side effects like increased heart rate or jitteriness, but serious problems are rare. We monitor your baby closely throughout treatment. Parent: How long will my baby need treatment? Doctor: Usually, treatment continues until your baby’s breathing control matures, which is typically around 34 to 35 weeks corrected gestational age or when apnea episodes have resolved for several days. Most babies outgrow apnea of prematurity as their nervous system develops. Parent: What should I watch for or be concerned about? Doctor: If you notice your baby turning blue, becoming very limp, or if the apnea episodes become more frequent or prolonged, please notify the medical team immediately. We are here to support you and your baby through this. Parent: Thank you, doctor. It helps to understand what’s going on and what to expect. Doctor: You’re welcome. We’ll keep monitoring your baby closely and adjust treatment as needed. Please feel free to ask any questions anytime.
