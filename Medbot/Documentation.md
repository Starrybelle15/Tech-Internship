üìÑ Documentation Report: Pediatric Pulmonology Medical Chatbot
1. ‚úÖ Project Overview
Title:
A Pediatric Pulmonology Medical Chatbot

Objective:
To develop a conversational AI assistant that provides informative, medically relevant responses related to pediatric pulmonary conditions such as asthma, bronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia, based on structured and curated medical data.

2. üìÇ Data Collection
Data Source:
The chatbot was trained on a set of plain-text .txt files containing:
Disease definitions
Symptoms
Red flags
Treatment guidelines
General advice

These files were manually curated and sourced from:
Pediatric pulmonology textbooks
Publicly available medical guidelines (e.g., CDC, WHO)
Verified medical websites and publications

Data Preprocessing:
Merged the two .txt files into a one structured dataset knowledge base.
Cleaned for consistency: removed line breaks, standardized medical terms.
Categorized into:
definition
symptoms
red_flags
advice

3. üß† Model Architecture
Model Used:
spaCy TextCategorizer (for intent detection)
Rule-based Classifier (fallback)
No deep learning or large language models were trained from scratch.
Simple logic maps user queries to conditions using classification and keyword-based rules.

spaCy Pipeline:
Pretrained en_core_web_trf transformer model (based on RoBERTa)
Custom categories for:
Asthma
Bronchiolitis
Pneumonia
Cystic Fibrosis
Others

Intent Prediction:
Input text ‚Üí spaCy ‚Üí TextCategorizer ‚Üí Predicted condition with confidence score

6. üõ°Ô∏è Limitations & Ethical Considerations
Not a Medical Device:
This chatbot does not provide diagnoses.
It‚Äôs intended for informational and educational purposes only.
Should not be used as a replacement for a licensed pediatric pulmonologist.

Limitations:
Only recognizes predefined conditions.
No real-time symptom analysis.
Does not support multi-turn complex reasoning.

7. üìà Future Improvements I Plan on Making to the Chatbot:
Integration with OpenAI GPT or a fine-tuned LLM for better generalization.
Voice interface for accessibility.
Rich UI with links to trusted sources (e.g., AAP, Mayo Clinic).
Expand to other pediatric specialties (e.g., cardiology, neurology).

9. üë®‚Äçüî¨ Sample Interaction
User: My 2-year-old has a persistent cough and wheezing.

Bot: Possible Condition: Asthma (Confidence: 0.88)

Definition: Asthma is a chronic lung condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways...

Common Symptoms:
Cough (especially at night)
Wheezing
Shortness of breath

Red Flags (Seek urgent care if these appear):
Blue lips or face
Severe difficulty breathing

General Advice:
Avoid known allergens
Ensure medication adherence

‚úÖ Conclusion
This chatbot serves as a helpful assistant for parents, caregivers, or students learning about pediatric lung conditions. While it's not a replacement for medical advice, it bridges the gap between unstructured web searching and professional consultation.
